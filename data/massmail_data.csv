        Dear Campus Community,
MTD has reduced bus service because of staffing shortages. Campus hopper routes will remain unchanged, but passengers may experience increased wait times with fewer shuttles operating. Also, many routes and connections that individuals regularly use to reach the general campus area have been adjusted or rescheduled.
Before making a trip, please check the updated schedules on the MTD website, which uses real-time tracking data. You can also sign up for custom alerts once logged in to your MTD account.
MTD is making every effort to preserve as much service coverage as possible while addressing the need for more operators. The nationwide labor shortage continues to present significant challenges for many industries, including public transportation. 
For questions, call MTD at (217) 384-8188. Service information and announcements will also be posted to MTD social media (@rideMTD) regularly.
Sincerely,
Danita M. Brown YoungVice Chancellor for Student Affairs"

                October 7, 2021 8:01 AM
			
        Dear campus community member,
In order to maintain an effective emergency response and evacuation plan, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign recently completed a test including two components: a drill and an exercise. The test was designed to challenge our emergency response procedures and how we notify you of a threat to our campus community. We are informing you of these efforts so you have more information about our plans to protect you in the event of an emergency, and to comply with disclosure mandates set forth in the federal Clery Act.
On Sept. 7, we initiated a test of our Illini-Alert emergency notification system. The drill was announced ahead of time by a mass email to campus and an Eweek notification to faculty and staff. The Illini-Alert system sent an email to the campus email addresses of all active students, faculty and staff. Those who have registered alternate email addresses also received a notification. Those who have registered a cellphone number received a text message during this drill.
Illini-Alert messages are also posted to Twitter and digital signage throughout campus buildings. This approach increases the speed and breadth of our distribution of emergency notifications, and it provides alternate notification methods that will continue to function even if one system fails to work properly.
For the second component, university stakeholders and emergency responders gathered virtually on Sept. 21 for a tabletop exercise. Those involved were presented with a scenario involving a train derailment with a subsequent fire and hazardous material spill directly affecting the campus. The exercise tested various components of the Campus Emergency Operations Plan, including evacuation procedures.
This test was conducted to ensure we have a robust response plan in the event of a campus emergency, and that our notifications will reach you in a timely and effective manner. If you have not signed up to receive Illini-Alert text messages, please visit emergency.illinois.edu to register.
To view the university’s emergency response and evacuation procedures, please visit go.illinois.edu/EmergencyResponse.
The Division of Public Safety is committed to maintaining a safe and secure campus environment where education, research and public service can flourish. We can only do so with the assistance of our community, and we hope this information is useful to our campus partners.
Sincerely,
Sherry A. WootenAssistant Director of Emergency ManagementDivision of Public Safety"

        Dear Students,
Beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 13, undergraduate students who are out of compliance for COVID-19 testing will lose access to certain university technologies. These technologies include Compass, Canvas and others. See the full list here.
This only applies to students who are required to participate in on-campus testing, which includes all students who are not fully vaccinated with a verified record and those who are fully vaccinated who have been asked to test temporarily due to an increase in cases at their residence.
You will be notified via email before your technology is restricted. Your access to university email, campus Wi-Fi, and health and safety services will not be affected.
If you are out of compliance, please visit one of our on-campus testing sites as soon as possible and take an on-campus COVID-19 saliva test to get back into compliance. 
After you take an on-campus COVID-19 test, you will regain access to these technologies, but it may take up to four hours for that to be reflected in your Safer Illinois app.
Noncompliance with the testing requirement may also result in referral to the Office for Student Conflict Resolution for formal disciplinary action up to, and including, dismissal.
For questions or concerns, please email covidwellness@illinois.edu.

                September 29, 2021 11:33 AM
			
        Hello students,
The Student Sustainability Committee (SSC) is a student-led organization that funds student, staff, and faculty project proposals via two student fees—the Cleaner Energy Technologies Fee and the Sustainable Campus Environment Fee—which together make up the Illinois Green Fund. Projects selected for funding are those which provide the greatest benefit to sustainability on campus, while providing engaging, educational opportunities for students to learn more about sustainability. The SSC is accepting project applications now! 
Additionally, the SSC is introducing a new program to guide students from a broad interest in sustainability to a fully-fledged project application. By supporting applicants step-by-step through our process, we hope to engage students on a larger scale, ultimately resulting in the strongest applications possible. This new Project Funding Workshop Series will span five sessions, which can be found on the SSC calendar. Our first meeting will be held this Wednesday, September 29th, from 4-5 pm CT, in Lincoln Hall, Room 1065. We will discuss issues related to sustainability on campus that could be addressed with an SSC-funded project. In subsequent sessions, we will develop solutions to these challenges, create project proposals, and help participants write funding applications.
For anyone who is passionate about sustainability and the environment, this is a great opportunity to turn your passion into a tangible, positive change for the campus community! Presently, we are not offering this event online. If you are unable to attend in-person, but still would like to get involved with the SSC, you can stay up-to-date by signing up for our mailing list. If you are interested in becoming a General Member, or other aspects of the committee, please visit our website. Every student at the University pays approximately $14 a semester to the Illinois Green Fund, so please join us to help allocate these student dollars!
October is Campus Sustainability Month! We encourage you to attend UIUC’s inaugural Student Sustainability Summit this October, co-hosted with the Student Sustainability Leadership Council (SSLC). This month-long program includes University- and community-led sustainability efforts through events such as Green Quad Day, a Sustainability Research Symposium, teach-ins, tours of campus facilities, a movie night, and much more! To learn about the full breadth of the summit and stay updated on other sustainability-related RSOs, add the SSLC’s calendar. You can also connect with our social media accounts @ssc_uiuc and @uiuc_sslc on both Twitter and Instagram! Finally, for more information on campus sustainability efforts and events, check out the iCAP (Illinois Climate Action Plan) Portal and iSEE (Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment) Calendar.
We hope to see you at the Project Funding Workshop Series, Student Sustainability Summit, and more events throughout Campus Sustainability Month and beyond!Best,
Jack Reicherts

        Dear campus community member:
Each year around this time, we publish our Annual Security and Fire Safety Report which includes statistics from the previous three years concerning crime that occurred on campus, in certain off-campus buildings or on property owned or controlled by the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The report additionally includes statistics for fires which occurred in on-campus student housing, fire safety policies and procedures, institutional policies concerning campus security, and other safety information.
Creating and maintaining a safe community is a responsibility that the University of Illinois Police Department and Campus Code Compliance and Fire Safety take very seriously. However, we cannot do it alone. Crime and fire prevention is a community effort, and you are our most valuable public safety resource. By reviewing this report, you are partnering with us to take the necessary steps to look out for yourself and others and to create a safer campus community for everyone.
Toward this end, and in compliance with federal regulations and the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Crime Statistics Act, a copy of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Annual Security and Fire Safety Report is available online at police.illinois.edu/clery.
A hard copy of the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report may be obtained by visiting the U. of I. Public Safety Building at 1110 W. Springfield Ave., Urbana, IL 61801, or by contacting 217-333-1216. You may also review the Daily Crime Log at the front desk of the U. of I. Public Safety Building or online at police.illinois.edu/crime-reporting/daily-crime-log.
In addition to reviewing this report, there are other important steps you can take to enhance your own safety on campus:

        Dear Colleagues,
On behalf of our students, thank you for your commitment and contributions to re-engaging them in the richness and unmatched benefits of the residential university experience this semester. Looking to the spring semester, we must double down on this commitment. The past year and a half, we routinely heard that students want more in-person instruction and more opportunities for in-person discussion sessions, collaborations and engagement with instructors and peers alike to advance their learning and educational development. When our students made the decision to attend the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign this year, they did so with the expectation of increased in-person experiences. We owe it to them, and we are prepared to deliver on their expectations. 
The University has been working diligently ensuring that we are maximizing safety in our on-campus environment for students, faculty and staff. Our health and safety measures reflect the most current guidance from the CDC, IDPH, CUPHD and the SHEILD team: a face covering requirement for indoor university facilities; a thorough review of and standards for ventilation that meet the CDC’s COVID-19 recommendations for ventilation/HVAC systems for instructional spaces on campus; implementation of vaccine requirements for students, faculty and staff with one of the highest community vaccination rates in the state; and all of the above augmented with a proven, robust, effective PCR testing ecosystem. Our SHIELD team has found that our in-person classes are among the safest places in the community. There has been no evidence of spread of COVID-19 in the classroom.
As we plan for spring, our expectation is that courses that can be offered in-person will be offered in-person and will remain in this delivery modality. Instructors who wish to change modality must request and receive approval from the department and college to do so. As part of that process, the instructor will need to describe the unique circumstances around the request and discuss them with the unit executive officer. Instructors with health issues that prevent them from being in the classroom may seek an accommodation through an ADA process.
We have all worked so hard to make our campus as safe as possible. The university monitors health and safety conditions very closely, we are cognizant of the choices made by local school districts, and in the event conditions deteriorate, we will modify our approach.
We recognize we are all here because of and for our students. All of us together will deliver to them the educational experiences they expect and need to become the leaders and innovators of tomorrow.
With appreciation,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

To help our employees meet this requirement, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) are conducting two (2) on-campus COVID-19 vaccination clinics that are open to all employees next Tuesday, Sept. 28. Employees do not need to utilize benefit time to visit these clinics and receive a vaccination.

It is anticipated that both Johnson and Johnson and Pfizer vaccines will be available. At the time of the first dose, a follow up appointment for the second dose will be given. Those follow up appointments will be scheduled for October 19, 2021.
All faculty and staff who are not able to receive the vaccine for medical or religious reasons must request an exemption through the ADA Division of the Office for Access and Equity by filling out the request form and submitting any relevant documentation: ADA Division Online Employee Accommodation Request Form.
We are hopeful these on-campus clinics will allow for more convenient access to the vaccines. Thank you for doing your part to maximize the safety of our entire community. If you have questions, please contact ihr-ler@illinois.edu.

        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
I am pleased to announce that Professor Germán Bollero will serve as the interim dean of the College of ACES pending approval by the Board of Trustees. He will hold the title interim dean designate until formal approval by the board. Professor Bollero’s selection comes after consultation with members of the College Executive Committee, senior academic leaders and faculty of the College.
Professor Bollero has been a member of the faculty at Illinois since 1998, with a tenured home in the Department of Crop Sciences. Thanks to his seasoned experience in various leadership roles and a strong record of dedicated service to ACES, Professor Bollero will provide the stability and the leadership to allow the college to continue moving forward during this transition. The excellence of his scholarship, his commitment to the convergent research culture of Illinois and the respect he has earned across our entire campus made him a clear choice to serve in this critical role.
I anticipate launching a national search for the permanent dean of ACES later this semester. In the weeks ahead, I will consult with the ACES Executive Committee and College leadership about forming the search committee, and I will share that information when it is finalized.
I want to thank Dean Kidwell for her leadership of ACES and to particularly recognize her for her efforts in helping the ACES faculty, staff and students navigate the unprecedented challenges COVID-19 has brought with it.
Please join me in welcoming, Professor Bollero as the interim dean designate of ACES. I am confident he will have the full support of his colleagues and that ACES will continue under his leadership to advance in its academic and scholarly missions with the optimism and confidence the world has come to expect from our first and oldest college at Illinois.

        Dear Colleagues,
I am pleased to announce the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign 2021 Campus Charitable Fund Drive (CCFD), our annual workplace giving campaign, which will take place from Sept. 22 through Nov. 17.
As we continue to navigate the impacts of COVID-19, this campaign is an opportunity to support our communities at home and around the world. For eight weeks, university employees can safely and easily support the charities of their choice to make a positive impact on the lives of many. I encourage you to explore the CCFD website to learn more about our campaign and the causes that are important to you. Giving can be a one-time gift or an ongoing payroll deduction.
Since the start of the pandemic, this entire university has shown the world what happens when the Illinois family comes together. Last year, after transitioning to a virtual space, we were able to raise over $1.3 million to help others in our local community and beyond. This year, our goal is to raise $1.5 million to benefit those in need.
I especially want to thank our Illinois faculty members and staff volunteers who serve as unit leaders to help make CCFD possible. They play an invaluable role in coordinating the efforts of the campaign. If you have any questions about CCFD, I encourage you to reach out to your college or department unit leader.
I am grateful for your thoughtful consideration during this campaign. Together, we can make a tremendous difference in the lives of others.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Students and Employees,
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug Free Workplace Act and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act require the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:
http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/
The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.
Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to marijuana in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s marijuana prohibition.
The university’s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.
The university’s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.
Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. University employees should contact Illinois Human Resources at (217) 333-2137.

        Dear Members of the University Community, 
At the beginning of every academic year, I write to you to reaffirm our university’s commitment to equal opportunity, affirmative action and equal access. This commitment to create and maintain an equitable and just campus community is essential to upholding the most fundamental principles of academic freedom, equity and human dignity, which are core to the mission of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Our university is committed to creating a campus community in which each person knows that their talents, perspectives, life experiences and faith traditions are respected and valued. We are also committed to using our intellectual and scholarly power to address structural and systemic biases and social disparities in our community, nation and world.  
University policies prohibit discrimination and harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, disability, national origin, citizenship status, ancestry, age, order of protection status, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, arrest record status, unfavorable discharge from the military and status as a protected veteran. These protections extend to all members of the campus community during any stage of the employment process, including but not limited to, recruitment, selection, promotion, transfer, merit increases, salary, training and development, demotion and separation. Similarly, the university prohibits discrimination in admissions, enrollment, and provision of services, programs, and activities. 
As a part of our affirmative action plan, consistent with state and federal laws, we undertake good faith efforts to increase the representation of women, minorities, individuals with disabilities, and veterans among our faculty and staff. An affirmative action plan is essential to furthering equal employment opportunity and diversity on our campus and to fulfilling our affirmative action obligations. 
The Office for Access & Equity is available to assist any employees who have concerns about discrimination, harassment or retaliation. You can submit a discrimination or harassment claim through the university’s online reporting portal (accessible claim form). To learn more about OAE’s broader services related to equity, affirmative action and disability-related matters, please see the Office for Access & Equity website. You can also review the nondiscrimination policy and sexual misconduct policy and procedures for addressing Title IX sexual harassment complaints online. Retaliation against any person for exercising their rights under these policies is strictly prohibited.  
The ADA Division of the Office for Access and Equity facilitates disability, religious and pregnancy/parenting accommodations for all faculty, staff, undergraduate and graduate student employees, as well as job applicants. The ADA Division engages in an interactive process to determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation for each person. The division also provides advice, consultation and educational programming to increase awareness and inclusion of individuals with disabilities. To request a reasonable accommodation, employees can complete the online employee accommodation request form.
Students can learn more about the student academic supports and accommodations services that may be available to them by contacting the Division of Disability Resources & Educational Services. Students also have the right to request accommodations for religious observances and can learn more from the Office of the Dean of Students.
We recently shared an update regarding Title IX and our commitment to prevent and respond to sexual misconduct. Please visit the We Care website to learn more about confidential and non-confidential resources, university policies, disciplinary procedures, rights and options and additional information related to the prevention, reporting, and response to sexual misconduct. Questions regarding Title IX may also be sent to the U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights.  
Creating an inclusive and equitable campus requires that we annually reaffirm our individual and collective commitments. Only together can we build a university community that is truly diverse, welcoming and inclusive of students, scholars and staff. 
Sincerely, 
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
As we begin a new academic year, I write to share with you information about the offices, policies and resources available on our campus to help prevent and respond to sexual harassment and misconduct. The University of Illinois believes that each member of our university community should expect to learn and work in a community that prioritizes care, dignity and mutual respect. This expectation includes our responsibility to create a campus community that is free of harassment and discrimination based on sex, including gender discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and sexual violence. University policy prohibits discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation and gender identity, consistent with the Department of Education’s interpretation of discrimination based on sex.
Danielle Morrison, our university’s Title IX Coordinator, provides oversight and support for the university’s comprehensive Title IX programs and initiatives. Dr. Morrison can be reached at titleixcoordinator@illinois.edu or (844) 616-7978. You may also visit the Title IX Office for more information about ways the office can assist.
A full description of the Sexual Misconduct policy, process and information about reporting obligations, as well as the provision of confidential advisors under Title IX, is maintained centrally on the We Care: Sexual Misconduct Support, Response, and Prevention website. All students, faculty and staff are asked to review the University of Illinois System Statement on Sex Discrimination, Sexual Harassment and Other Sexual Misconduct, which is also located on the We Care site. The Sexual Misconduct Policy in the Campus Administrative Manual and Student Code includes other prohibited sexual misconduct in addition to Title IX Sexual Harassment.
If you experience sexual misconduct – including sexual harassment, sexual assault, and other forms of sexual violence – know that you are not alone and support is available. On our campus, there are several confidential resources, including the Counseling Center, McKinley Health Center and the Women’s Resources Center (WRC). The WRC has Confidential Advisors, who are staff members specifically trained to provide support and advocacy. The We Care site has additional information about campus resources and answers to frequently asked questions about reporting options.
Sexual misconduct in any form violates our institutional values. It is the responsibility of each one of us to stand up against harmful behavior in our community. I encourage you to take a few moments to learn more about these campus resources, so that together we can continue to create a university that supports and values the success and well-being of all.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

As you know, on Aug. 26, Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced a mandate that all university students must be vaccinated against COVID-19. After this announcement, I sent this email message to the university community reiterating our university rules and processes following the governor’s new executive order. I’m writing to clarify our expectations:
All students (except those who are fully remote and never come to campus) are required to receive a first dose of a university-accepted COVID-19 vaccine by Sept. 15. Get vaccinated at CRCE by making an appointment in your MyMcKinley Portal or find a nearby appointment at vaccines.gov and get vaccinated today.
If you have not already done so, you are required to receive a final dose and submit your Vaccination Record Card to the MyMcKinley Portal by Oct. 15. You should submit as soon as you receive your final dose.
All students who are not able to receive the vaccine for medical or religious reasons must request an exemption and submit any relevant documentation by Sept. 15:
To request a medical exemption, submit through the MyMcKinley Portal. 
To request a religious exemption: Fill out this form and email it to helpdean@illinois.edu. 
You will receive an interim exemption while your submission is being reviewed.
All students who are granted an interim or ongoing exemption will be required to continue the on-campus testing program, currently set at every other day for undergraduates and twice per week for graduate students.

The Governor’s executive order sets minimum testing expectations for those who are unvaccinated. From the beginning of this pandemic, the university has made clear that our top priority is to maximize safety for our entire community. Aligned with this strategy, after Oct. 15, all students who do not have a Vaccination Record Card OR an exemption on file will be required to take an on-campus COVID-19 test every day until they are fully vaccinated.
This policy is enforceable through existing progressive discipline processes, which may result in dismissal.
Individuals who are not able to be vaccinated and are not able to participate in the on-campus testing program cannot be on campus or at a university-affiliated location off campus and must be fully remote.
Thank you for doing your part to maximize the safety of our entire community.
Sincerely,

I am delighted to share the news that I awarded Presidential Medallions this morning to two more key leaders in the University of Illinois System’s extraordinary response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Abigail Wooldridge and Harley T. Johnson of the Grainger College of Engineering in Urbana-Champaign helped design and develop our mobile SHIELD testing labs and join 28 other honorees who received medallions earlier this week. The medallions are the highest honor the system president can bestow and are the first I have awarded during my six years in office.
The news release below detailing our newest medallion winners' work will be shared with media later today.
Please join me in congratulating them, and my thanks to all of you for everything you have done to support our universities, our students and our state during this challenging time.

President honors leaders of COVID-19 lab developmentPresidential Medallions given to innovators behind SHIELD mobile labs 
CHAMPAIGN, Ill. – University of Illinois System President Tim Killeen on Friday honored two people who are among the primary leadership behind the system’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, presenting them with the Presidential Medallion. The medallion is the highest honor the system president can bestow.
Abigail Wooldridge, an assistant professor in the Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and Harley T. Johnson, associate dean for research in UIUC’s Grainger College of Engineering and a professor in its Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, were recognized for their key roles in the development of a prototype laboratory to process COVID-19 tests as part of the SHIELD test-and-trace system developed at UIUC and mobile labs now deployed around the country by Shield T3, a system-related organization created to provide the tests outside Illinois.
Wooldridge and Johnson join 28 others who have been awarded Presidential Medallions for their leadership in the system’s pandemic response. 
Killeen, who recognized Wooldridge and Johnson during a leadership retreat at the I Hotel on the UIUC campus, called the work that created the labs indispensable.
“The SHIELD test is crucial to our ability to keep our universities open and now to protect many thousands of people beyond those campuses. Without the fast, accurate results provided by these labs, none of this would be possible,” Killeen said. “The efforts of these leaders and thousands of their colleagues across the U of I System remain a source of great pride for me and for the system. Their ingenuity, dedication and hard work continue to demonstrate in real time the impact that the system and its three universities create for Illinois and its people.”
Killeen honored 28 other individuals on Monday for their roles in SHIELD, SHIELD Illinois, Shield T3, vaccine trials conducted at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) and a mass vaccination effort at UIC.
The SHIELD system includes the saliva-based COVID-19 test as well as the companion app to deliver test results, all developed at UIUC. SHIELD Illinois was created to share the SHIELD system across the state and the test is now in use or being launched at numerous other colleges and universities, community colleges, public community testing sites, private companies and more than 1,200 K-12 schools. Through Shield T3, the SHIELD system is now in use at a number of other universities, school systems and other organizations outside Illinois. Shield T3 has deployed six mobile labs around the country to support those efforts, with more planned.
UIC has been a trial site for two national clinical vaccine trials, including the first trial conducted in the city. UIC and its academic health enterprise, UI Health, also led a vaccination effort that vaccinated health system workers, and opened Chicago’s first mass vaccination site in February 2021 at Credit Union 1 Arena, offering vaccines to the public as well as its own students, faculty and staff. 
The Presidential Medallion is given to recognize individuals who support and bring distinction to the University of Illinois System; enhancing and accelerating its ability to deliver on its mission in profound ways. The award is bestowed solely at the discretion of the president, and the 30 bestowed by President Killeen related to pandemic response are the first of his six years in office.
Previous recipients include Shahid Kahn, a UIUC alumnus who owns the Flex-N-Gate company, the NFL’s Jacksonville Jaguars and English soccer team Fulham F.C., in 2013; civil rights leader Myrlie Evers, also in 2013; members of the Tuskegee Airmen, in 2007; and Thomas M. Siebel, an alumnus and the founder, chairman and CEO of C3.ai, in 2001.
###
The University of Illinois System is a world leader in research and discovery, and the largest educational institution in the state with more than 90,000 students, about 26,000 full-time equivalent faculty and staff, and universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield. The U of I System awards more than 23,000 undergraduate, graduate and professional degrees annually."

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
As you probably know, this morning, Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced a mandate that all state employees and university students must be vaccinated against COVID-19. With the recent FDA approval of the Pfizer vaccine, we have even more evidence that vaccines are safe and effective. And we know they help mitigate the effects of Delta and other variants. I am confident that today’s state mandate will help us fight COVID-19, so we can end this pandemic that is causing so much suffering and anxiety for our community and our world.
We already have a vaccination requirement in place on campus, and we have made significant progress in that effort. I write today to reinforce our rules and processes based on the governor’s announcement.
Everyone on campus must wear a face covering when indoors at any university facility.
All faculty, staff and students must have received their first dose of a university-accepted COVID-19 vaccine by Sept. 5, if they plan to continue to be on campus this semester.
Those who have not yet been vaccinated must do so immediately. In the meantime, they must continue to participate in the on-campus COVID-19 testing program until they are fully vaccinated with a verified Vaccination Record Card in the MyMcKinley Portal.
Employees and students who are not able to receive the vaccine for medical or religious reasons must request an exemption, and we will share information on the exemption process in the coming days.
Those who receive an exemption must continue participating in the testing program under the frequency established by the university, which could increase based on the spread of the disease.
Those who do not comply with the mandate will face disciplinary action.
We are still receiving vaccine information and verifying it, but these are the percentages of verified vaccinations for various student and employee groups on campus as of this morning.
Undergraduate students: 88%
Graduate students: 88%
Faculty: 82%
Academic professionals: 87%
Civil service: 65%
Please note that these preliminary numbers represent only the verified information of people who have uploaded their COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card to the MyMcKinley Portal.
These percentages will grow as more people are vaccinated and upload their records. If you need assistance uploading your vaccination record, please contact the Wellness Answer Center via email at covidwellness@illinois.edu or call 217-333-1900. Technology Services has also set up support desks across campus to provide hands-on assistance for those who need it. Some units may also have additional on-site support to help with uploading cards. Please reach out to your IT director to learn about any opportunities.
If you have received your first dose of an approved vaccine, make sure to get your final dose as soon as you are able to do so and upload your information immediately.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our goal has been to maximize the safety of our entire university community and to do so with transparency. These numbers are a good start, and our students are doing a great job leading the way, but those who have not yet fulfilled this mandate must do so immediately.
If you have not already been vaccinated, find a nearby appointment at vaccines.gov and get vaccinated today. Students can also make an appointment to be vaccinated at CRCE through the MyMcKinley Portal.
Thank you for helping us demonstrate to the world how to crush this pandemic.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear students, faculty and staff:
I am grateful to Governor J.B. Pritzker and fully endorse his decision today to require COVID-19 vaccinations for all students, faculty and staff at Illinois colleges and universities, as well as to initiate a statewide mask mandate in public buildings for everyone aged 2 and older regardless of vaccination status. Over the summer, the University of Illinois System announced those same requirements for our students, faculty and staff for the new semester that began Monday.
The governor’s requirements and ours are in alignment and represent the best approach to curb rising COVID-19 infection and hospitalization rates across the state. They are consistent with our own scientific modeling of the risks associated with the spread of the virus and its variants, as well as the Illinois Department of Public Health’s guidance and goals.
We expect everyone on our campuses to follow these important, life-saving requirements. Those who are not yet vaccinated must comply with the governor’s executive order. Masks are already required indoors on our campuses, but will now also be required in all public buildings beginning Monday.
Throughout the pandemic, our students, faculty and staff have made the U of I System the gold standard for safety and a model for the nation. We have pulled together magnificently over the past 18 months and I have every expectation that you will lead the way again, building on our great momentum.
My deepest thanks to all of you for your cooperation and compassion, and I wish you the very best as we fulfill our missions and continue our remarkable efforts to help move beyond the pandemic.
Sincerely,
Tim"

        Dear Colleagues,
We are excited to start the fall semester this week and welcome everyone back to this new year at Illinois. Your dedication and effort throughout the last 18 months has been critical in helping maximize the safety of everyone in our community and in allowing us to offer the kind of in-person experiences so many of our students have missed. Thank you for your hard work and commitment.

        Welcome students, faculty and staff!
This fall, we have our sights set on a semester that will bring back the familiar rhythms of campus life that were disrupted by a global pandemic. We plan classes that are largely in-person, albeit with some that will remain hybrid or online. We envision buildings and offices filled with activity again. We are counting on fans being present to cheer on our athletes; the return of concerts, cultural events and student activities; and the traditional bustle between classes that has been quieted by COVID-19.
Still, the virus and its variants have taught us to expect the unexpected. So we will stay on our toes, prepared to tweak or even overhaul our plans as needed to ensure the safety of our campus communities.
But the last 18 months have proven that our University of Illinois family will lead the way through whatever challenges we are handed. We pioneered a testing protocol now used around the world and hosted seminal clinical trials for vaccines and therapeutics that have restored a semblance of normal and hope for an end to the crisis. We pulled together for an academic year that made us a model for the nation, maintaining on-campus learning with no serious student illnesses while many of our peers across the nation struggled.
I couldn’t be prouder of our students, faculty and staff for their creativity, resilience, selflessness and sacrifice, and for proving yet again that our system of three best-in-class universities is altogether extraordinary.
Whether you are returning this fall or joining us for the first time, I wish you a year of fulfillment that reaffirms the hopes and dreams that led you here.
Sincerely,

                August 23, 2021 2:02 PM
			
        Dear Colleagues,
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is committed to upholding Illinois law requiring the University to reasonably accommodate its students’ religious beliefs, observances, and practices in regard to admissions, class attendance, and the scheduling of examinations and work requirements. Whenever possible, it is best practice to plan exams, required labs, and other due dates around religious holidays. The Religious Observances Calendar is an excellent resource to bookmark for reference to find listings of the primary sacred times for many world religions by year.
When planning around such dates is impossible, instructors need to provide accommodations for students who have a religious observance as outlined in the Student Code, Article 1, Part 5 – Class Attendance and Article 1, Section 1-107 on Religious Beliefs, Observances, and Practices. Notable for unit executive officers, Section 1-107 b. allows appeals to the dean of the academic unit offering the course when a religious accommodation is not granted or a student believes that the accommodation is unreasonable. Accordingly, units should be prepared to have a process for the dean to hear such appeals or to have a committee, such as a capricious grading committee or the executive committee, that will hear appeals and act on behalf of the dean. Appeals should be rare, as instructors are expected to offer reasonable accommodations as required under Illinois law.
Information for faculty on accommodating religious observances contains helpful tips for application and best practices. Instructors who have questions may contact Stephen Bryan, Dean of Students, at 217-333-0050 or via email at deanofstudents@illinois.edu.
Thank you for your time and consideration of this important matter.

28 receive U of I System honor for leading COVID-19 responsePresidential Medallions given to leaders behind SHIELD efforts and vaccine work 
URBANA, Ill. – University of Illinois President Tim Killeen on Monday honored 28 key leaders of the system’s COVID-19 response with the Presidential Medallion. The medallion is the highest honor that the system president can bestow.
In a ceremony at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) attended by Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Killeen honored leaders behind the development of the SHIELD test-and-trace system and subsequent organizations created to expand its use beyond the system’s universities. Also honored were the leaders of clinical trials for vaccines at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), the first conducted in Chicago, and a mass-vaccination effort at UIC that has inoculated hospital staff and patients, students, faculty and, so far, tens of thousands of members of the public.
“I have never been more proud than I am today to recognize these colleagues and their leadership, said Killeen, awarding the first Presidential Medallions in his six years as president. ""Their ingenuity and dedication and the hard work of thousands of their colleagues across the U of I System have saved lives on our campuses, in the surrounding communities, and well beyond. Their efforts have demonstrated in real time what the U of I System means to the people of Illinois and ensured that our response to the pandemic has been unlike that of any university system in the world. These initiatives are reflective of the power of the U of I System as a real force for innovation, positive change and the public good.”
Pritzker praised those honored Monday for their service to the state of Illinois and its residents.
“In our fight against COVID-19, the efforts of the University of Illinois System have been a real asset to millions of Illinoisans,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said. “That begins with the successful effort last year to keep campuses open to the more than 90,000 students enrolled at U of I System universities. But it extends to the tens of thousands of people who found access to life-saving vaccines in the Chicago area, students at universities and community colleges who have been protected by the SHIELD test, and this fall to students at more than 1,000 K-12 schools around the state who will be protected by access to SHIELD. I am deeply grateful to the leaders being honored here today and to the thousands of others who have been part of the U of I System's aggressive and ongoing response to the pandemic.”
Those receiving the Presidential Medallion for their roles in the U of System’s response to the pandemic are listed below.
From SHIELD, SHIELD Illinois and Shield T3
The SHIELD test-and-trace system includes the non-invasive, fast and reliable saliva-based test as well as the companion mobile application to deliver test results, all developed at UIUC. The test has been successfully used since the summer of 2020. SHIELD Illinois was created to share the SHIELD system across the state. The test is now in use or being launched at numerous other colleges and universities, community colleges, public community testing sites, private companies and – thanks to funding from the state – more than 1,000 K-12 schools. Shield T3 was created to spread the technology outside of the state, and it is in use at a number of other universities, in school systems in Baltimore and Washington, D.C., and at private companies and other organizations outside Illinois. In all, well over four million tests have been administered.
Those receiving Presidential Medallions are Fadi G. Alnaji, post-doctoral researcher focusing on virology, UIUC; Christopher Brooke, associate professor of microbiology, UIUC; Martin D. Burke, May and Ving Lee Professor for Chemical Innovation at UIUC and associate dean for research at the Carle Illinois College of Medicine; Timothy M. Fan, professor and the assistant head of research and graduate studies in the UIUC Department of Veterinary Clinical Medicine; Richard Fredrickson Jr., clinical professor and director of the UIUC Veterinary Diagnostics Laboratory; Nigel D. Goldenfeld, Swanlund Endowed Chair and Center for Advanced Study Professor of Physics, UIUC; Kelsie J. Green, laboratory technician, UIUC Department of Chemistry; Paul J. Hergenrother, Kenneth L. Rinehart Jr. Endowed Chair in natural products chemistry, UIUC; Robin Holland, head of the Diagnostic Services Section, Plum Island Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, and 2020 doctor of veterinary medicine graduate, UIUC; William C.

From UIC vaccine clinical trials and UIC/UI Health vaccine deployment
UIC has been a trial site for two national clinical vaccine trials, including the first trial conducted in the city. The trials matched the diverse demographics of the city and included strong representation of groups that were have been particularly affected by the pandemic. UIC and its academic health enterprise, UI Health, led an effort that vaccinated health system workers, and opened Chicago’s first mass vaccination site in February 2021 at Credit Unit 1 Arena, offering vaccines to the public as well as its own students, faculty and staff. UI Health continues to offer multiple clinics and other access for vaccinations in the city, and a team of student volunteers has been used to proactively schedule vaccination appointments for patients, focusing first on neighborhoods hardest hit by COVID-19. UIC is also conducting ongoing research on vaccine hesitancy.
Those receiving Presidential Medallions are Kimberly Bertini, director of nursing excellence and Magnet Program director at UI Health; Susan Bleasdale, chief quality officer, assistant vice chancellor for quality & patient safety, UI Health; Paul Gorski, senior director of clinical services, integration and operations officer, UI Health; Jerry Krishnan, associate vice chancellor for population health sciences and professor of medicine and public health, UIC ; Janet Lin, physician and professor of emergency medicine, UIC; Richard Novak, Harry F. Dowling Professor of Medicine and chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases, UIC; and Mary Kate Titus, administrative fellow, UI Health.
The Presidential Medallion is given to recognize individuals who support and bring distinction to the U of I System; enhancing and accelerating its ability to deliver on its mission in profound ways. The award is bestowed solely at the discretion of the president.
Previous recipients include Shahid Kahn, a UIUC alumnus who owns the Flex-N-Gate company, the NFL’s Jacksonville Jaguars and English soccer team Fulham F.C., in 2013; civil rights leader Myrlie Evers, also in 2013; members of the Tuskegee Airmen, in 2007; and Thomas M. Siebel, UIUC alumnus and the founder, chairman and CEO of C3.ai, in 2001.

        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
I am pleased to announce that College of ACES Dean Kim Kidwell will join my leadership team as the inaugural Associate Chancellor for Strategic Partnerships and Initiatives effective Sept. 16, pending approval by the Board of Trustees. Until Board approval has been received, her title will be Interim Associate Chancellor for Strategic Partnerships and Initiatives. She will remain a tenured faculty member in her home department, Crop Sciences. Provost Cangellaris will be consulting with the ACES Executive Committee, as well as members of the college leadership team and members of the faculty, to choose an interim dean and to outline a process and timeline for a search to recruit the next permanent dean.
In her new role, Dean Kidwell will be working with my leadership team, as well as in close collaboration with the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation in the development of high-priority, high-impact, multi-stakeholder initiatives for the university. Her initial emphasis will be focused on leveraging the Next 150 strategic plan and campus investments, as well as the Illinois Innovation Network (IIN) and Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) framework to develop initiatives and partnerships that will position the University to lead the scientific discoveries, innovations and public-private partnerships that will inspire and empower tomorrow’s sustainable food and agricultural systems. Dean Kidwell will also be the Illinois lead on the IIN Governing Council and be engaged with their strategic planning efforts this fall. Additional priorities in her new role will include developing new public-private partnerships to catalyze new initiatives in data-driven agriculture and personalized nutrition and to establish a more robust state support network for rural health and nutrition. Significantly, this investment of an Associate Chancellor for Strategic Partnership to implement key initiatives in the Next 150 strategic plan will deepen partnerships with state and federal agencies, elected leaders and new bridges between university scholarship and public policy to accelerate agricultural innovation and development for new discoveries, new jobs and a more competitive state.
Dean Kidwell’s tenure at ACES has been marked by new initiatives and programs that have positioned the college to meet the needs of our 21st century society. Programs like the new Metropolitan Food and Environment Systems major have reinvigorated undergraduate interest and enrollment. There has been a significant expansion of the research capital infrastructure and portfolio that includes several major new federally funded centers in digital agriculture and artificial intelligence, as well as the completion of the long-anticipated Feed Technology Center. And the college’s capacity to offer world-class experiences and programs has been further fueled by impressive growth in corporate and private philanthropic support. That success culminated with this summer’s announcement of a new $45 million donation from Doris E. Christopher – the largest gift in the college’s history.
These accomplishments, along with her development of new external partnerships and the reimaging and realignment of Extension, make Dean Kidwell the clear choice to lead this critical new effort for our university.
Please join me in congratulating Dean Kidwell in her new role here at Illinois.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

As part of our university’s work to acknowledge our responsibility to the Native Nations for whom Illinois is their ancestral home and establish meaningful reciprocal relationships with these Nations, I am pleased to announce that Jacki Thompson Rand will become the inaugural Associate Vice Chancellor for Native Affairs and Senior Adviser to the Chancellor on Native Affairs Issues. As a member of the senior leadership of the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion, Dr. Rand will serve as the university’s Tribal Liaison to help the campus establish and maintain respectful relationships with Native American Nations and help our university adopt standards and strategies appropriate for Native tribal and Indigenous community engagement. In this role, Dr. Rand also will collaborate with the NAGPRA Office in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research & Innovation, which is responsible for upholding our university’s commitment to the repatriation of our Native American, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian collections in consultation with tribal communities and lineal descendants.
An enrolled citizen of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, Dr. Rand brings an expertise in public and community-facing research that ideally positions her to serve in this new role. Prior to Illinois, Dr. Rand served as faculty in the Department of History at the University of Iowa for more than two decades, and at Illinois, she will join the faculty of the American Indian Studies Program. Working at the intersections of American Indian Studies, History, and Gender and Women's Studies, she utilizes the methodologies and ethics of public and digital humanities, archival and oral history research, and community engagement to account for Native American experiences within and across the 19th and 20th centuries. At Iowa, she also participated in the Iowa First Nations Program, which hosts high school students from Nations that occupied the state of Iowa and surrounding region, and was the co-coordinator of the Native American and Indigenous Studies Program.
At the state and national level, Dr. Rand has served on the American Indian Council for the Office of the State Archeologist where she advised on issues related to the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, and has extensive experience with museums, including 11 years in various roles at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington D.C., where she conceptualized and planned community consultations in Indian Country throughout the United States. Dr. Rand is the author of Kiowa Humanity and the Invasion of the State (University of Nebraska Press, 2008) and an ongoing digital humanities project on the Indigenous Midwest. She holds a Ph.D. in History from the University of Oklahoma.
Please join me in congratulating Dr. Jacki Thompson Rand on assuming this important role for the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and help welcome her to our community.

                August 18, 2021 10:01 AM
			
        Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is committed to the most fundamental principles of academic freedom, equality of opportunity and human dignity. In order to enable all members of the campus community to fully and freely participate in their educational, research and workplace experiences, we must identify and address behaviors that negatively affect the climate of inclusion and belonging on our campus. More than ever, it is critical that our university prioritizes building a campus environment that allows people of all backgrounds to participate in the constructive exchange of ideas based in respect and true inclusion. Acts of racism, sexism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and other negative behaviors do not have a place at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and must not be allowed to impact our commitment to create a campus community that values the full range of talents, perspectives, cultures, faith traditions and life experiences that the nearly 60,000 members of the university community bring to our campus each year.
The Bias Assessment and Response Team (BART) has been an important and visible mechanism to help students, faculty and staff to inform the university when they encounter behaviors that negatively impact their campus experience. As we begin this new academic year, we are taking some important steps and making new investments to enhance this critical service. Additionally, the program will transition into the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (VCDEI) from its previous home in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs (VCSA). This service is strongly aligned with the VCDEI’s mission, and this decision comes at the joint recommendation of both offices following an extensive evaluation over the last year.
During this transition between offices, members of our campus community will see no disruption or interruption of this critical support service.
The transition will include new processes designed to:
Offer a mechanism for students, staff and faculty to inform the university if they experience behaviors that negatively affect their experience on campus.
Leverage new investments of resources and personnel to maximize the accessibility, responsiveness and effectiveness of the process for members of our community.
Educate the campus community on relevant issues related to diversity, equity, inclusion, access, free speech and academic freedom.
Consistently affirm our institutional commitment to a campus environment that values diverse perspectives and constructive dialogue.
As has always been the case, the process is not part of the University’s disciplinary systems and participation is not mandatory by any member of the campus community.
We will continue to respond to reports submitted by members of the campus community about negative behaviors that impact experiences of inclusion and belonging in a prompt and equitable manner. Beginning August 23, reports can be submitted at go.illinois.edu/campusbelonging, and will be received by VCDEI staff, who will coordinate response to the reports. The current BART site will also automatically forward to the new reporting portal.
Our transition plan includes a commitment to hire additional professional full-time staff members, which will allow us to continue to improve our responsiveness and educational efforts. The campus community will also have an opportunity to provide comment on the design of the new process. We will share more information with the campus community during the fall semester about opportunities to provide feedback and next steps in the development of the new initiative. Based on campus feedback and assessment, additional refinements will be made to the new process in spring 2022.
I would like to thank Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Dr. Danita Brown Young, the BART co-chairs, January Boten and Debra Imel, and all members of our community who have volunteered their time to serve on the BART committee.
I hope that you will share your perspectives as we build this new resource to strengthen the sense of campus belonging throughout our university community.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                August 18, 2021 8:02 AM
			
        Dear students,
As we approach the beginning of the Fall 2021 semester, I’m writing to remind you about some important COVID-19 policies the university will have in place to maximize the safety of our entire community.
Important On-Campus COVID-19 Requirements
You are required to be vaccinated for COVID-19 if you are able. OR You are required to participate in the on-campus COVID-19 testing program if you are not able to be vaccinated or if your vaccination record card has not yet been verified by the university.
If you have not yet been vaccinated and you are able to do so, there will be walk-in COVID-19 vaccines available this week (Aug. 17-19) at State Farm Center from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day.

You are required to wear a face covering indoors in all university spaces.
If you have been vaccinated, you are required to upload a photo of your Vaccination Record Card to the MyMcKinley Portal. Once it is verified, you will receive “Granted” building access status. (A recent negative on-campus test also gives you “Granted” building access status.)
You are required to have “Granted” building access status in either the Safer Illinois app (recommended) or the Boarding Pass.
If asked, you are required to show your building access status to your professors, supervisor, advisor, Wellness Support Associates and university healthcare professionals.
You are not required to show the vaccination status screen in your app to anyone. This is your private health information.

If you test positive for COVID-19, you are required to follow instructions from the university and the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District.
Though people who are fully vaccinated are not required to participate in the COVID-19 testing program for building access, the university encourages every student to get tested immediately if they experience any symptoms.
We continue to take guidance from the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and the Champaign Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD), and we are actively monitoring COVID-19 on campus and in the local community. We will make modifications to our approach for the semester if necessary. For more information about the university’s COVID-19 policies, visit covid19.illinois.edu. If you have questions, please email covid-19@illinois.edu.
We have confidence in our approach for this semester, and we are delighted to welcome you all back to campus for the start of the academic year. Thanks to COVID-19 vaccines and our unmatched on-campus COVID-19 testing ecosystem, I am very optimistic about this semester, and I look forward to seeing you back on campus.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Instructors,
As we have done in the past, we’re once again asking you to help us distribute important safety information to our students. Emergencies can happen anywhere and at any time, so it’s important that we take a minute to prepare ourselves for a situation in which our safety could depend on our ability to react quickly.
Before the first day of class this semester, we ask that you visit http://police.illinois.edu/instructor-resources. There, you’ll find two items: A brief script we hope you will read on the first day of class and a one-page handout that we would like to have distributed to all students either by hand or as part of your syllabus.
These two items contain valuable information that can keep us all safer in the event that a fire, weather emergency or active threat should emerge. By distributing this information, we are ensuring that everyone in our campus community is empowered with tools they can use to protect themselves and others.
We also encourage you to empower yourself by visiting http://police.illinois.edu/safe. There are steps you can take right now to prepare should you find yourself in an emergency situation.
Thank you for taking a few minutes to enhance the safety of our campus community.
Sincerely,
Alice CaryExecutive Director of Public Safety and Chief of Police"

        Dear faculty and staff,
I am pleased to announce that Michael DeLorenzo will be the Vice Chancellor for Administration and Operations Designate, pending approval by the Board of Trustees. This position change is a well-deserved recognition of the role that Mike is already playing in leadership and responsibility at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The new position will take effect Aug. 16.
Mike has been serving in executive leadership roles for 14 years at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and he has more than 30 years of leadership experience working in higher education. Before he arrived at Illinois, he held positions at the University of Illinois Chicago and the University of Florida. Mike has a bachelor’s degree in history from Colorado State University, a master’s degree in sports administration from The Ohio State University and a Ph.D. in public administration from the University of Illinois Chicago.
Mike currently serves as Senior Associate Chancellor for Administration and Operations for the university. A member of the university’s senior leadership team, he serves as liaison to the Division of Intercollegiate Athletics and oversees the Division of Public Safety, Facilities and Services, Parking, Purchasing, the Illinois Fire Safety Institute, the Police Training Institute and Willard Airport.
His expanded role will add Allerton Mansion, the Chicago Illini Center, Facility Classroom and Event Management and Scheduling, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign contracts, campus space usage, Altgeld and McFarland Carillion and other areas to his current portfolio. He will also have responsibility for the university’s emergency planning.
In his new role, he will continue to lead the university as the chair of the COVID-19 Executive Leadership Committee. I cannot overstate the impact Mike has played in this role since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to his already extensive portfolio, he has been the driving force behind the university’s reputation for COVID-19 safety and innovation. His discerning judgment, collaborative approach, adaptability, understanding of the university and relationships with community partners have guided every facet of our pandemic response. Our university community owes Mike its gratitude for his steady leadership during one of the most important, unknown and critical periods in our university history. He will continue to lead in this role, and I am confident he will do so with great impact.
Please join me in congratulating Mike on his well-deserved appointment as Vice Chancellor for Administration and Operations at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
Sincerely,

2021-07-29T10:09:00Z,2021-07-29,10:9,92646,Face coverings required in all University facilities...,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/1483839306.html,"Face coverings required in all University facilities beginning July 30
                July 29, 2021 10:09 AM
			
        Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,
On Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a new recommendation that even fully vaccinated individuals should wear face coverings in public indoor settings in areas of substantial or high community transmission of COVID-19. The Illinois Department of Public Health and the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) fully support this new guidance. Even though our campus community is making good progress in mitigating COVID-19 impacts with our vaccination and testing participation, Champaign County remains among those areas with concerning levels of transmission.
Consistent with our practice of following CDC and public health COVID-19 guidance, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign will once again require all faculty, staff, students and visitors to wear a face covering inside our university facilities beginning on Friday, July 30. 
Updated Indoor Face Covering Guidance
All university students, faculty, staff and visitors must wear a face covering in university spaces indoors, regardless of vaccination status. For unvaccinated individuals, university face covering requirements remain the same.
For all individuals, a face covering does not have to be worn when eating or drinking, when alone in an office or room with the door closed or when alone in a vehicle—essentially, when you are alone in a private space.
Individuals with a medical condition or disability that prevents them from safely wearing a face covering may seek a reasonable accommodation. Students needing an accommodation should contact the division of Disability Resources & Educational Services, and employees (including student employees) needing workplace accommodations should contact the ADA Division of the Office for Access and Equity.
This requirement is limited to face coverings only. There are no new social distancing or capacity restrictions at this time.
Unit plans for the return-to-on-site operations are not impacted by this new face covering requirement.
Individuals who witness unsafe COVID-19 behavior by a student or employee may submit their experiences here: http://go.illinois.edu/COVID19-report. These reports are reviewed by Student Affairs and Illinois Human Resources, who will also manage any necessary follow-up.
This face covering requirement will remain in effect until CUPHD determines that county-wide case rates, hospitalizations, transmission levels and outbreaks return to levels that allow the requirement to be lifted. But we should all plan for the face covering requirement to be in effect when we open the fall semester.
I remind everyone that our previously announced vaccination, testing and facility access requirements for faculty and staff and for students remain in effect and are unchanged. If you have not uploaded your vaccination information to the MyMcKinley portal, I urge you to do so as soon as possible to ensure the smoothest opening for your fall semester.
Vaccinations and our comprehensive testing program are the most powerful tools we have available to let us come back together as a University and community, and the surest way to avoid setbacks like this latest return to face coverings. We are fortunate that vaccinations are readily available in our community to individuals who are 12 or older. You can find information about where and how to receive a COVID-19 vaccination shot here. As I said earlier, the virus continues to impact all of us. But together, we can help our entire county and community navigate these challenges. 
Once again, we see how guidance and expectations can change quickly as we continue to navigate this pandemic. We are working quickly to update the university COVID-19 website and our existing resources with this guidance and information. We will continue to provide more information about any further adjustments or changes to our operations and policies. If you have questions about any of these new changes, you can always email COVID-19@illinois.edu.
Thank you for your patience and thank you for once again wearing a face covering inside our university facilities starting on Friday, July 30.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear faculty, staff and students,  
I am pleased to announce Professor Venetria K. Patton as the Harry E. Preble Dean Designate of the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences. She is currently Head of the School of Interdisciplinary Studies at Purdue University. Professor Patton will begin this new role on August 2, 2021, pending approval by the University of Illinois Board of Trustees.
Following a national search for this position, I consulted with the search committee, College leadership and with Chancellor Robert Jones. Professor Patton emerged as the best candidate to serve as the next dean.
Professor Patton has held several leadership roles at Purdue University. Before serving as Head of the School of Interdisciplinary Studies, Professor Patton served as Provost Fellow for Diversity and Inclusion and before that, as director of the African American Studies and Research Center.
Before arriving at Purdue, she was an Associate Professor of English and of African American Studies at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Her teaching and research are focused on African American and Diasporic Women’s Literature. She holds a B.A. in English from the University of La Verne and an M.A. and Ph.D. in English from the University of California-Riverside.
The university home of roughly one-third of students and faculty on our campus, our College of Liberal Arts & Sciences has a legacy of excellence and a strong reputation. I am confident that Professor Patton will advance the college and amplify the world-renowned, human-centered scholarship being done across disciplines to advance the world.
I wish to express my sincere gratitude to Professor Gene Robinson who has led LAS as interim dean since July 2020. Under his leadership, the College’s excellence has continued to advance and laid a solid foundation for future growth and success. We thank him for this service as he returns to lead the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology (IGB) following an extremely successful five-year review of his IGB leadership conducted last year. I also thank Professor Don Ort who in turn served as acting director of the IGB this past year.
I also want to thank the members of the search committee, chaired by Dean Vikram Amar, for their efforts and commitment to this search.
Please join me in congratulating Professor Patton on her appointment as dean designate of the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

                July 27, 2021 10:17 AM
			
        Because of the extreme heat forecasted for the Midwest this week and anticipated high electric demand on the regional grid, Facilities & Services (F&S) is designating today through Wednesday, July 28, as an Energy Alert period for the Urbana campus.
F&S asks that all students, faculty, and staff in university facilities help maximize unit and individual energy conservation efforts, especially between the hours of 2 and 6 p.m., when demand is typically the greatest. Please take additional actions to conserve energy.
Turn it off!If practical, shut off, shut down, sleep mode, or unplug the following:
Lights
Computers
Monitors
Printers
Chargers
Appliances
Other nonessential equipment
Keep it closed!Close the following items to protect facility equipment and systems:    
Outside windows and doors in air conditioned areas
Fume hood sashes when not in use
Window shades to ensure rooms stay cool
Why is taking action during Energy Alerts important?Abbott Power Plant generates approximately half of the campus’ electricity through an efficient cogeneration process, which simultaneously produces both steam and electricity. The remainder of the power needed to support teaching and research activities is purchased from the regional grid.
The hot and humid conditions over the next two days, combined with energy resource availability, have the potential to set new peak usage levels for this year. As a participant in the electric market, the university pays a capacity charge based on usage at the moment of the peak demand load. This capacity charge is incorporated into the campus utility rate, and adjustments can potentially lead to increased electrical prices for the university. Who answers temperature-related questions?Please contact the F&S Energy Management Control Center fandsenergycomm@illinois.edu, 217-244-3783, regarding any hot/cold issues in campus facilities. The center features enhanced data monitoring and integrated building system automation to perform diagnostics and assist with operational response.
Thank you for helping to reduce our electrical demand during these peak periods. Conserving energy is everyone’s responsibility and at the core of our commitment to sustainability on campus.

        Dear Faculty, Staff, and Students:
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign values and respects all people in our campus community, including those deceased individuals whose remains are in our care. In light of recent events regarding treatment of the remains of African American or enslaved individuals at universities and museums across the country, the University reaffirms its commitment to the respectful care of all human remains.
In particular, we recognize that the remains of African American and other individuals who have been marginalized - descendants of enslaved individuals, Native Ancestors, individuals brought here from outside of the United States and cadavers used in medical education - all deserve the same dignity, care, and respect.
The University is currently working to confirm the histories and identities of all human remains on campus. In 2020, we established a campus-wide office (the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act Office) to lead efforts to care for and return the remains of Native Ancestors and funerary and cultural items in campus collections. While we do not believe that the University houses the remains of any African American or enslaved individuals, we are auditing existing collections to determine appropriate next steps. We also are considering how best to approach the care and return of human remains originating from outside of the United States. We are committed to close collaboration with descendant communities as we undertake this work. 
If you have questions about the audit, or if you would like to disclose the presence of human remains on campus, please reach out to the NAGPRA Office (nagpra@illinois.edu) for additional guidance. The team, which is housed in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation, includes experts in the analysis of human skeletal remains and works closely with descendant communities, in partnership with the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion. 
Thank you for your careful attention to this important issue.

                July 21, 2021 11:15 AM
			
        Dear faculty and staff,
As you may have read in a message from President Tim Killeen, the University of Illinois System is requiring that faculty and staff at all three universities (Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield) receive a complete course of COVID-19 vaccines before the beginning of the Fall 2021 semester, if they are able to do so. For employees covered by a union contract, guidance will be implemented through the applicable collective bargaining processes.
When we announced the COVID-19 vaccination requirement for our students several weeks ago, you may remember that we said at that time there were no plans to do the same for faculty and staff. Since that time, the System made the decision to require COVID-19 vaccinations for faculty and staff. We fully support this decision and believe that widespread COVID-19 vaccinations at our university provide the best opportunity to maximize the safety of our entire community.
Though this requirement is new, operationally, our protocols for the Fall 2021 semester will remain nearly identical to those previously announced:
Faculty and staff should be vaccinated for COVID-19 if they are able to do so.
Faculty and staff who are not vaccinated will continue to be required to wear face coverings and participate in the on-campus COVID-19 testing program. For the Fall 2021 semester, this means testing and receiving negative test results twice per week.
The university is following Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) guidance and accepting vaccines currently authorized for emergency use by either the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the World Health Organization.
Vaccinated faculty and staff should submit their Vaccination Record Card to the MyMcKinley Portal and have it verified.
If you have not been vaccinated for COVID-19 and you are able to do so, visit vaccines.gov to find available appointments or walk-in hours in your local area.
If you are not able to be fully vaccinated before the beginning of the Fall 2021 semester (due to timing, travel, etc.), please continue to test until you are fully vaccinated and your Vaccination Record Card has been uploaded and verified in the MyMcKinley Portal.
We acknowledge that some individuals have health conditions or other reasons why they cannot be vaccinated. For those individuals, the COVID-19 testing program and face coverings will continue to be required.
The CDC has shared data showing that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and fully vaccinated individuals can start to resume most aspects of pre-pandemic life. The CDC has also provided guidance about COVID-19 vaccinations for higher education institutions that further strengthens the System's decision to require everyone (faculty, staff and students) to be fully vaccinated. 
I know that during this pandemic, new guidance and expectations have changed quickly. Thank you for your continued patience and understanding as we navigate this next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear colleagues:
As part of our ongoing commitment to the safety of our campuses and the communities around them, the University of Illinois System will require that all faculty and staff be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 by the beginning of the fall semester of 2021. For employees covered by a union contract, guidance will be implemented at the universities through the applicable collective bargaining processes.
This vaccine requirement follows similar guidance provided to our students in June and is consistent with our own scientific modeling of the risks associated with the spread of the virus and its variants, as well as the Illinois Department of Public Health’s guidance and goals.
We recognize that some individuals are not able to be vaccinated. That is why it is so important that those of us who can get vaccinated do so. Those who are not vaccinated will need to follow campus-specific or system-office guidelines and any exemption protocols issued by each university, the U of I Hospital and clinics, or the System Offices.
Throughout the pandemic, we have not compromised the education, student experience and groundbreaking research that make the U of I System truly extraordinary. You, along with our students, have been the authors of that success, helping make the system a model for collective effort in pursuit of the common good.
Now we look forward to your help in setting a new standard this fall, a semester in which we will restore most in-person instruction and many of the other traditional rhythms of campus life. This will not be possible without widespread vaccinations.
Each of our universities will follow up with additional guidance on vaccinations and other safety measures planned for the fall. We will also continue to monitor our policies closely, adjusting where appropriate based on advances in scientific understanding and updated guidance from public health authorities.
Sincerely,
Tim"

        Dear faculty and staff,
As many of you prepare to return to on-site work for the Fall 2021 semester, I am writing to share additional details about COVID-19 requirements and protocols. In order to maximize the safety of our entire community, the university will have updated precautions in place. Please read this email carefully to ensure you are able to follow the guidelines. Please also view this email that was sent to all students.
Vaccines & Testing  
If you have already been vaccinated for COVID-19 with a university-accepted vaccine, you should upload your Vaccination Record Card to the MyMcKinley Portal as soon as possible. See more information here. If you have already uploaded your record, you do not need to do it again.
If you are an unvaccinated faculty or staff member who is working fully on-site or on a hybrid schedule, you are required to participate in the on-campus COVID-19 testing program as soon as you return on-site.
You will be required to test and receive negative results twice per week to maintain building access. This testing frequency will take effect starting on Aug. 2.
This testing frequency was been chosen based on SHIELD team modeling that shows this testing frequency is necessary to maximize the safety of individuals in our community who are unvaccinated.

Face Coverings
If you are fully vaccinated, following CDC guidelines, the university no longer requires you to wear face coverings, except in healthcare settings including COVID-19 testing centers, the McKinley Health Center, etc. See the full list of locations where face coverings are required for everyone here.
If you are not fully vaccinated, following CDC guidelines, the university will require you to wear face coverings in university spaces, except when you are alone in a private space.
Note: Some fully vaccinated individuals may also choose to continue wearing face coverings. I encourage you to be mindful of this as people make their individual choices. You should not assume that someone wearing a face covering is unvaccinated.
Other COVID-19 Protocols
If you have previously been on-campus while COVID-19 protocols have been in place, some procedures will be different. There will still be Wellness Support Associates (WSAs) who conduct daily spot checks across campus at various classroom buildings. Certain buildings may also choose to hire their own WSAs for the semester. At some facilities, you may be required to show your building access screen (which shows if you are compliant via being vaccinated or testing, by using the Safer Illinois app or the Boarding Pass). You are not required to share or prove your vaccination status.
If you will be working fully on-site or on a hybrid schedule, please also familiarize yourself with the information on these webpages as there have been many updates this week:

If you are teaching a course for the Fall 2021 semester, please also read this FAQ for faculty/instructors thoroughly.
Please know these are the planned COVID-19 requirements and protocols we anticipate being in place for the Fall 2021 semester. However, we know that COVID-19 can be unpredictable. The university SHIELD team will continue to monitor for spread, spikes and emerging variants, including B.1.617.2 (Delta) which is already present in the county. We will also continue to follow guidance from the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD), the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC).
Thank you all for continuing to make choices that protect the health and well-being of our entire community. I am hopeful and excited for this upcoming semester—to see many of you walking across campus, to gather safely together at events and to continue to build the most powerful university family in the world.  It is such a privilege and honor to be your chancellor. I am grateful to each one of you.
Sincerely,

        Dear students,
As you prepare for the Fall 2021 semester, I am writing to share additional details about COVID-19 requirements and protocols. In order to maximize the safety of our entire community, the university will have updated precautions in place. Please read this email carefully to ensure you are able to make a smooth transition back to campus in a few weeks.
Vaccines & Testing  
If you are able to be vaccinated for COVID-19, you are required to do so. You should be vaccinated as soon as possible with an accepted vaccine to ensure you meet the requirement. Visit vaccines.gov to find appointments in your local community. See more information here.
If you have already been vaccinated for COVID-19 with a university-accepted vaccine, you should upload your Vaccination Record Card to the MyMcKinley Portal as soon as possible. See more information here. If you have already uploaded your record, you do not need to do it again.
If you are an international student and you are not able to receive a university-accepted vaccine before you arrive on campus, you will be able to do so when you arrive. There will be on-campus vaccination appointments at the beginning of the semester. Until you are fully vaccinated and have a verified vaccine record, you will be required to continue the on-campus COVID-19 testing program. See more information here.
If you are not able to be vaccinated, there is NOT an exemption process for the COVID-19 vaccine requirement. Instead, all unvaccinated students are required to participate in the on-campus COVID-19 testing program. See more information about the on-campus COVID-19 testing program here.
If you are arriving to campus unvaccinated, you must begin on-campus COVID-19 testing as soon as you arrive. Testing frequencies have been chosen based on SHIELD team modeling that shows this testing frequency is necessary to maximize the safety of individuals in our community who are unvaccinated:
If you are an undergraduate student, you will be required to test and receive negative results every other day to maintain compliance and building access. This testing frequency will take effect starting on Aug. 2. 
If you are a graduate/professional student, you will be required to test and receive negative results twice per week to maintain compliance and building access. This testing frequency will take effect starting on Aug. 2. 

If you are not vaccinated, and you are not compliant with the on-campus COVID-19 testing program, you will face student discipline. See more information about COVID-19 policy enforcement here.
Face Coverings
If you are fully vaccinated, following CDC guidelines, the university no longer requires you to wear face coverings, except in healthcare settings including COVID-19 testing centers, the McKinley Health Center, etc. See the full list of locations where face coverings are required for everyone here.
If you are not fully vaccinated, following CDC guidelines, the university will require you to wear face coverings in university spaces.
Note: Some fully vaccinated individuals may also choose to continue wearing face coverings. I encourage you to be mindful of this as people make their individual choices. You should not assume that someone wearing a face covering is unvaccinated.
Other COVID-19 Protocols
If you have previously been on-campus while COVID-19 protocols have been in place, some procedures will be different. There will still be Wellness Support Associates (WSAs) who conduct daily spot checks across campus at various classroom buildings. Certain buildings may also choose to hire their own WSAs for the semester. Some instructors may check your building access at the beginning of classes. Please note that you are only required to show your building access screen (which shows if you are compliant via being vaccinated or testing, by using the Safer Illinois app or the Boarding Pass) to WSAs or instructors. You are not required to share or prove your vaccination status.

                July 14, 2021 8:02 AM
			
        Dear campus community member:
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is committed to creating a safe environment for everyone who participates in programs on our campus, including those who are under the age of 18. As many of you prepare to again begin hosting on-campus programs, camps and other activities, we would like to remind faculty and staff about the university policy on protection of minors and our procedures for implementing that policy. You can find more information on those items by following the below links.
Protection of minors policy: http://go.illinois.edu/POMpolicy
Procedures for implementing the policy: https://cam.illinois.edu/policies/hr-64/
Everyone involved in a university-sponsored program or activity and who is responsible for the supervision of minors or whose duties would require close contact with minors must undergo a criminal background check and sex offender registry check. Please review the implementation procedures for more information about this requirement.
These requirements apply to all university personnel, volunteers and contractors associated with events and activities where minors will be involved. Units with programs or activities designed to include minors who are not enrolled at the university are required report those activities to the University of Illinois Police Department at http://go.illinois.edu/POMform. External entities or Registered Student Organizations may report activities using a shortened version of this form which can be found at http://go.illinois.edu/POM-short-form.
Virtual or online events involving minors are subject to many of the same requirements as in-person events, and organizers must complete the protection of minors form for those activities as well.
You can visit the University Police website at http://go.illinois.edu/protection-of-minors for more information, including a five-minute video from the University of Illinois Ethics and Compliance Office explaining everything you need to know. We encourage you to use this video as a training tool in your unit.
Anyone with questions may contact Protection of Minors Compliance Specialist Stephanie Vogelsang at 217-300-1533 or srvogel@illinois.edu.

Alice Cary

        Dear Students and Employees,
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug Free Workplace Act and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act requires the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:
http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/
The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.
Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to marijuana in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s marijuana prohibition.
The university’s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.
The university’s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.
Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. University employees should contact Illinois Human Resources at (217) 333-2137.
Sincerely,
Dr. Danita M. Brown YoungVice Chancellor for Student Affairs"

                June 29, 2021 2:19 PM
			
        Facilities & Services (F&S) is designating June 29, 30, and July 1, an Energy Alert period for the Urbana campus. The transmission operator, who monitors the load on the regional grid, has indicated that a combination of extreme weather and current resource availability may require producers and consumers to take proactive measures that manage the demand on the regional electric grid. F&S’ Utilities & Energy Services division is continuing to monitor conditions. If further action is needed, an additional notice will request individuals, departments, colleges, institutes, and units to reduce energy usage to the greatest extent possible in university facilities.
Why is taking action during an Energy Alert important to the university?Abbott Power Plant generates approximately half the campus’ electricity through an efficient cogeneration process, which simultaneously produces both steam and electricity. The remainder of the power needed to support teaching and research activities is purchased from the regional grid. Reducing energy consumption during this period lowers the capacity charge assessed to campus for the coming year.
What can you do to help?Should Energy Alert conditions persist, you can help Beat the Peak by taking action during the lingering hot and humid conditions, especially between noon and 10 p.m. or when leaving facilities for the day or the weekend.
If practical, shut off, shut down, sleep mode, or unplug the following:
Lights
Computers
Monitors
Printers
Chargers
Appliances
Window AC units in unused spaces
Other nonessential equipment
Close the following items to help further protect facility equipment and systems:    
Outside windows and doors in air-conditioned areas
Window shades to block the sun
Fume hood sashes when not in use
For temperature-related questions regarding specific rooms and building spaces, please contact the F&S Energy Management Control Center at fandsenergycomm@illinois.edu, 217-244-3783.
Conserving energy is everyone’s responsibility at the university. Thank you for remaining energy-aware.

        Dear colleagues:
I am thrilled to tell you about our second cohort of faculty and researchers who will receive funding under the University of Illinois System’s Presidential Initiative: Expanding the Impact of the Arts and the Humanities.
In this new round of funding, 10 projects from across our three universities were selected for funding from 22 extraordinary proposals. These 10 will share the available $1.54 million in support from the system.
The new projects all have the potential for groundbreaking impact, and I encourage you to read the details in the release below that will be sent to news media today.
The continuation of this initiative underscores the importance of the arts and the humanities to the U of I System. They are simply central to who we are – and to our missions of education, scholarship and public engagement. And they hold just tremendous potential to inspire and empower our students and enhance the public good.
I want to thank Barb Wilson, in particular, for shepherding this process forward, and the faculty and administrators who participated in the review process, as well as all involved in proposal preparation.
Please join me in congratulating these recipients.
Sincerely,
Tim

Arts & humanities initiative offers new support for 10 projectsPresident’s initiative will provide $1.54 million for a second round of projects  
The University of Illinois System continues to demonstrate its commitment to the arts and humanities, funding a second round of vital projects through the Presidential Initiative: Expanding the Impact of the Arts and the Humanities, President Tim Killeen announced today.
The new round of funding will provide $1.54 million to support 10 projects, including an effort to break down barriers between African studies and African-American studies, a project dedicated to increasing knowledge of the state’s rivers and a plan to transform art education with new ideas about disability.
Presidential Initiative: Expanding the Impact of the Arts and the Humanities was launched by Killeen to enhance and celebrate the arts and humanities at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) and University of Illinois Springfield (UIS).
“The arts and humanities enrich our lives and help us understand the human condition in an increasingly complex world. This has been illustrated to us all, once again, with vivid clarity over the past 15 months of the pandemic and societal upheaval. I believed it was vital to create this fund in order to support projects that help ‘light the path’ forward for all of us, and I am proud that the U of I System is now providing a second round of funding for such important work,” Killeen said.
The new projects further demonstrate the university system’s commitment to building a better society for all Illinoisans, said Cynthia Oliver, who is the associate vice chancellor for humanities, arts and related fields at UIUC and was a member of the committee that reviewed proposals.
“It is so important that we demonstrate the value of arts and humanities research on our campuses and what our artists and humanities scholars contribute to our overall quality of life, our intellectual stimulation and our creative impulses. Great imaginations are at work in all of these projects,” Oliver said. “That the University of Illinois System is committed to this kind of support is imperative, especially now. I am honored to have been a part of the selection process and am only sorry we didn’t have twice the amount of support to offer our brilliant colleagues and double the impact.”
Five of the new projects will receive $175,000 each and the other five will receive at least $85,000. By comparison, the median arts grant award in fiscal year 2018 from the National Endowment for the Arts was about $20,000 and 58 percent were less than $25,000, according to the advocacy group Grantmakers in the Arts.
Presidential Initiative: Expanding the Impact of the Arts and the Humanities is supported by both the offices of the president and the executive vice president of the U of I System, using funds that support academic activities.
The initiative was launched in 2018 as the Presidential Initiative to Celebrate the Impact of the Arts and the Humanities. The first round of projects, 14 in all, was chosen the next year and included an Illinois writer’s festival, theater renovations and the use of virtual reality to teach theatrical performance.
The new projects include:
Africana World Studies at UIUC and UIC, $175,000Teresa Barnes, Maimouna Barro, Mary Gathogo, Erik McDuffie, Tekita Bankhead and Sam Smith (UIUC); and Lynette Jackson and Kirk Hoppe (UIC)The development of a joint Africana World studies project on the UIC and UIUC campuses will help break down long-standing academic silos of African studies and African-American studies. Through a three-semester sequence, the project is expected to lead students to new opportunities for language learning and community engagement, and it will impact the curriculum at both universities. The project leaders anticipate that the primary participants will be undergraduate students.
The Multiethnic Digital Humanities Project, $175,000Mark Canuel, Rhea Ballad-Thrower and Sandra De Groote (UIC)The project will use digital tools and platforms to connect Black studies, Asian studies, Latin American and Latino studies, Native American and Indigenous studies and other key areas. The project leaders plan to build on the success of the Digital Humanities Initiative, which helped transform humanities work and artistic expression with digital research tools and innovative online platforms. By applying digital tools to multiethnic studies, the project will extend their public reach, as well as embracing faculty work from all three universities in the system. Students and faculty also will be exposed to cutting-edge research using digital tools.
American Plumbing: The Canals, Rivers, and Communities that Bridge North and South – Illinois Rivers Project, $175,000Rachel Havrelock (UIC) and Anne-Marie Hanson (UIS)With plans to host a series of events along Illinois’ rivers, this project is designed to increase knowledge about the state’s waterways and bring new voices to issues related to the environment and climate change. The five planned events will showcase local culture and open dialogues about water that allow experts from the U of I System to both teach and learn from the public. Working with partners, project leaders also plan to author stories, record knowledge and design interactive digital features – including an Illinois rivers website – that will later be featured in a series of public events.
Remembering Black Life in Color: Care, Memory, Community and COVID-19, $175,000Gwyneth Milbrath (UIC) and Karen Flynn (UIUC)Project leaders plan to work with organizations such as the Black Metropolis Research Consortium and the Chicago Chapter of the National Black Nurses' Association, recruiting students from a wide range of disciplines to help assemble a history of the human impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Black communities. The project will gather oral interviews and create both digital and portable exhibits for presentation. Project leaders also anticipate that their work will expand the collections of the Midwest
Nursing History Research Center at UIC and reach audiences outside the academy. Cripping the Arts, $175,000Karyn Sandlos (UIC) and Jorge Lucero (UIUC)Cripping the Arts will build an art-focused collaboration to allow students, faculty and disabled community members across the U of I System to take advantage of the well-recognized educational opportunities for people with disabilities at universities in Urbana-Champaign and Chicago. The project will begin with an exhibition in Chicago and Urbana-Champaign that will serve as the launch point for new community partnerships, teacher training and artist residencies. Project leaders plan to transform spaces dedicated to the arts as well as art education and studio practice through new ideas about disability. Students from UIUC and UIC will be involved in all stages of programming.
IC@Illinois: The Illinois Intercultural Competence Initiative, $171,000Elena Delgado (UIUC)Focused on undergraduate students, IC@Illinois intends to make the University of Illinois System a hub for intercultural communication and intercultural studies. The project will use a humanities-centered approach to focus on the trajectories and histories of U.S minority populations, as well as relationships among different cultures. Undergraduates will be able to earn certification in Intercultural Competence, which refers to the ability to interact and function effectively across cultures. Graduate students will have roles, too, contributing to the development of courses, workshops and teaching modules.
Informing and Enabling Illinois' Arts Ecosystem, $164,000Jennifer Novak-Leonard, Andrew Greenlee and Magdalena Novoa (UIUC)This arts-focused project will highlight the impact of the arts in communities around the state, and help identify factors that can better support the arts and artists in different regions. The project intends to help propel the newly launched Arts Impact Initiative within the UIUC College of Fine and Applied Arts in collaboration with the Department of Urban and Regional Planning. The project also will include a series of public forums, along with generating a series of evidence- and data-driven issue briefs and an applied workshop course in Urban and Regional Planning that will pilot curricula that explores how arts and artists are a part of community development.
Luis Alfaro's ""Are You Listening?"": Tragedy, Trauma, and Therapy Mental Health in the Latinx and BIPOC Communities of Illinois, $140,000Young Richard Kim and Christine Dunford (UIC)The project intends to showcase the transformational impact of the arts and humanities, using a residency by the acclaimed playwright Luis Alfaro (who is a University of Southern California associate professor) as a catalyst for students and to draw other artists and audiences to the UIC campus. Alfaro has written numerous plays that have been produced around the country. While the project will be based at UIC, its leaders plan for its reach to extend both into the city of Chicago and to the system’s two other universities in Urbana-Champaign and Springfield through engagement events.
Neverland, or ""Why Are there American Indians in Peter Pan?"": A Collaborative Work on New Theatre, $105,000Gabriel Solis and Terri Ciofalo (UIUC)The project’s leaders plan to produce a new work of theater, “Neverland,” by Madeline Sayet, executive director of the Yale Indigenous Performing Arts Program, in the spring of 2022. Sayet will serve a residency as a guest artist as part of the project. The play will be designed, performed, managed and studied by UIUC students and faculty, leading to the production of undergraduate and graduate research. The goal of this project is to substantially increase knowledge and understanding about Indigenous performance.
Making Our History: Artists Render Lincoln's Legacies, $85,000Graham Peck, Brytton Bjorngaard and Meghan Kessler (UIS)Making Our History will engage the public in Illinois and beyond in American history by using art as a lens for interpretating President Lincoln’s legacy and to spur conversation. Physical and digital exhibits will be created by historians and artists for display at the UIS Visual Arts Gallery, the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library & Museum (ALPLM) and the Springfield Art Association before being donated to the three universities in the system. Project leaders also plan outreach via news media and the ALPLM podcast series, and will work to connect with K-12 teachers as a key audience, encouraging them to bring their students to exhibitions.

        Dear faculty and staff,
As you may have read in this message from President Tim Killeen, the University of Illinois System is moving into this next phase of the pandemic with a requirement that students at all three campuses (Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield) receive a complete course of COVID-19 vaccines before the beginning of the Fall 2021 semester if they are able to do so.
We will be providing you soon with additional information and details about our plan toward this goal. At this time, I am sending this massmail to students to share the principles that will guide the fall semester at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I hope you will also read it, so you are aware of the expectations that will be in place for the Fall 2021 semester.
At this time, there are no plans to require the COVID-19 vaccine for faculty and staff. However, faculty and staff who are not vaccinated will have to continue to wear face coverings and participate in the COVID-19 testing program.
Again, we are still working through many details, and we hope to share more specifics soon. Thank you for your continued patience and understanding as we navigate this next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear undergraduate and graduate students,
As you may have read in this message from President Tim Killeen, the University of Illinois System is moving into this next phase of the pandemic with a requirement that students at all three campuses (Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield) receive a complete course of COVID-19 vaccines before the beginning of the Fall 2021 semester.
We are in full support of President Killeen’s belief that COVID-19 vaccinations provide the best opportunity for our university to return to near-normal operations while still maximizing the safety of all members of our community as this deadly pandemic continues to threaten much of the world. While our university is still working through details of how we will work with you toward this requirement, I’m writing to outline the principles that will guide the fall semester at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign:
For the Fall 2021 semester, it will be required that all students who are able to do so will be fully vaccinated (defined as 14 days after the final dose) with a university-accepted vaccine before beginning the fall semester if they plan to be on campus with no additional health and safety obligations.
Individuals who are not able to be vaccinated and/or who have not had their record submitted and verified will be required to participate in the COVID-19 testing program and to continue wearing a face covering.
The university is following Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) guidance and accepting vaccines currently authorized for emergency use by either the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the World Health Organization. If you are not able to access one of the university-accepted vaccines, you will be able to receive an accepted vaccine upon your arrival to campus.
Students should submit their Vaccination Record Card in the MyMcKinley Portal and have it verified before the beginning of the fall semester. Click here for more information on uploading your Vaccination Record Card.
If you have not been vaccinated for COVID-19 and you are able to do so, you should be vaccinated as soon as possible. Visit vaccines.gov to find available appointments or walk-in hours in your local area.
We acknowledge that some individuals have health conditions or other reasons why they cannot be vaccinated. For those individuals, the COVID-19 testing program and face coverings will continue to be required.
We will soon be providing more detailed information on requirements, policies and expectations for the fall semester, so I ask that you carefully read your messages from the university and from your departments and colleges in the coming weeks.
Our science-based, SHIELD-led testing and tracing ecosystem has allowed unmatched opportunities to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic with a level of confidence that was not available to many other universities. Our SHIELD ecosystem in combination with the availability of accessible and effective vaccines will allow us to have an academic year that feels far more normal.
The CDC has shared data showing that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and fully vaccinated individuals can start to resume most aspects of pre-pandemic life. I am hopeful that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to improve and we are able to use this new policy to provide more freedoms and experiences for you in the coming academic year.
Thank you for your continued patience and understanding as we navigate this next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                June 21, 2021 11:16 AM
			
        Dear students, faculty and staff:
To continue our commitment to collective safety, the University of Illinois System will require that all students receive a COVID-19 vaccination if they plan to be on campus for fall semester 2021. This requirement is consistent with our own scientific modeling of the risks associated with the spread of the virus and its variants. It is also consistent with the Illinois Department of Public Health’s goals.
We recognize that some individuals have health conditions or other reasons why they cannot be vaccinated. That is why it is so important that those of us who can get vaccinated do so. Those who are not vaccinated will need to follow campus-specific guidelines and any exemption protocols issued by each university. Individuals who plan to work or study remotely are exempted from these requirements.
Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, students have helped make the University of Illinois System a model for the nation – a model of community, a model of safety and a model of pulling together for the common good.  We look forward to their help in setting the standard again this fall, a semester that will restore most in-person instruction and many of the other traditional rhythms of campus life that COVID interrupted last year. Widespread vaccinations will help us do that.  
Each university will follow up with additional guidance on vaccination information as well as other safety measures planned for fall. We also will continue to monitor our policies closely, making adjustments as appropriate based on advances in scientific understanding and updated guidance from public health authorities.
Guidelines for faculty and staff are still being developed and will be shared later this summer.
Sincerely,
Tim"

                June 18, 2021 4:34 PM
			
        Dear campus community member,
As part of our commitment to transparency and giving you resources to keep yourself and others safe, we would like to provide information about gun-related violence that has been occurring in off-campus areas of Champaign-Urbana during the first half of this calendar year.
Local law enforcement has shared in community meetings and in the news media that reports of shots fired incidents in the off-campus community have increased in recent months. This follows a disturbing national trend of increasing gun violence. Although our campus has not been directly affected by these incidents to date, these trends take a very real toll on all of Champaign-Urbana. We are distressed by the impact this has on the people in our community, especially families directly affected by gun violence.
We also recognize our role in preventing community violence, and so the University of Illinois Police Department has taken a proactive stance in addressing these public safety issues. Our ongoing multi-jurisdictional partnership in the county’s Street Crimes Task Force continues to be productive in identifying and holding accountable violent offenders, especially those who engage in illegal activity with firearms. Additionally, we are increasing our patrol presence in areas immediately surrounding our campus with officers in vehicles, on bicycles, and on foot. A visible patrol presence like this is an effective way to deter crime.
If we become aware of a specific public safety issue affecting campus, we will notify you in a timely manner.
Even while we are taking proactive steps to address public safety issues, our greatest crime prevention tool will always be your active involvement in protecting yourself and those around you. Here are some things you can do to keep our community safe:
Use SafeWalks. Walking in groups of three or more is the best way to reduce your risk of being targeted by a criminal. If you need to travel on campus after 9 p.m., call 217-333-1216 to request a free walking escort provided by trained members of our Student Patrol or security staff.
Use emergency phones if needed. Dozens of blue emergency phones are strategically located across campus if you need help. The phones are a direct line to University Police and can also be used to request a SafeWalks escort.
Be aware of your surroundings. Take note of things that seem particularly out of the ordinary and consider whether you should take steps to avoid it. Some examples may include leaving an area where people are fighting or taking an alternate route if you identify a potentially dangerous situation. Remember that using your phone or listening to music can distract you from people or vehicles around you.
Report suspicious activity. We all have a good sense of what is normal and what is not. Remember that the police can help only if we know what is going on. It is important to report crime and other suspicious activity so we can investigate and prevent further incidents.
We have always said that the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe place to study, work and socialize. That is still true, but no community is completely crime-free. University Police will continue to take proactive steps to address public safety issues, and we ask that you do as well. Together, we can maintain a safe campus environment where academics, research and public service can flourish.
Sincerely,
Alice Cary
Executive Director of Public Safety and Chief of Police"

        Dear undergraduate and graduate students,  
Starting Monday, June 21, if the Safer Illinois app shows your vaccination record as verified, you will no longer be required to submit a saliva sample regularly for compliance and building access. Please read below for more information and directions for submitting your vaccination information through the McKinley Health Center for verification.
If you were vaccinated anywhere other than the McKinley Health Center or CRCE and have already uploaded your Vaccination Record Card and provided consent:
On Monday, you should receive a status change on your Safer Illinois app that shows your record has been verified. It should also be in place in the Boarding Pass.
Beginning on Monday, you can also check to see if your record has been verified by visiting the Immunizations section of your MyMcKinley Portal. Select “View History” and then click “Print” and there should be a full list of your verified vaccination records.
If you uploaded your card and provided consent and you do not see these changes, please check the following before contacting the Wellness Answer Center:
Has it been at least three weeks since your submission? It can take up to three weeks for the McKinley Health Center to verify your record by confirming it with university and other vaccination databases.
Are you sure you completed your submission? To check, visit the Immunizations section of your MyMcKinley Portal. If it is not displayed there, it may not have been saved, and you may need to submit again.
Did you receive an approved COVID-19 vaccine? For building access and compliance, the university is following CDC guidance and accepting vaccines authorized for emergency use by either the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the World Health Organization. See more information here.
Have you provided a verified English translation if your record is in another language?
Is your Safer Illinois app updated? Do you have your Safer Illinois app set to share your Health Provider Test Result and Vaccine information in your settings?
If you are required to test, you will need to continue to do so until your COVID-19 vaccine record has been verified.

If you have been vaccinated for COVID-19 in the state of Illinois but have not already uploaded your Vaccination Record Card and provided consent:
The state immunization data registry will be used to verify your immunization.
This verification process could take 4-6 weeks, so please be patient.
When your record has been verified, you will receive a status change on your Safer Illinois. It should also be in place in the Boarding Pass.
You can also check to see if your record has been verified by visiting the Immunizations section of your MyMcKinley Portal. Select “View History” and then click “Print” and there should be a full list of your verified vaccination records. Although you may see your vaccination record in the McKinley system, your vaccination status may not be immediately reflected in the Safer Illinois app.
If you are required to test, you will need to continue to do so until your COVID-19 vaccine record has been verified.
If you have been vaccinated for COVID-19 outside the state of Illinois (including in another country) but have not already uploaded your Vaccination Record Card:
Please submit your COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card and provide consent in the MyMcKinley Portal as soon as possible if you want your vaccination to replace regular COVID-19 on-campus testing for compliance and building access.
Here are instructions to submit and provide consent:
Log into the MyMcKinley Portal
Click on the “Forms” button in the menu header.
Choose “COVID-19 Vaccine Record Consent.”
Fill out the form.

It may take three weeks for the McKinley Health Center to verify your record by confirming it with university and other vaccination databases.
If you are required to test, you will need to continue to do so until your COVID-19 vaccine record has been verified.
If you have not already been vaccinated for COVID-19:
Visit vaccinefinder.org to find available appointments or walk-in hours in your local area. 
If you are not able to access one of the university-accepted vaccines, you will be able to receive an accepted vaccine upon your arrival to campus. See more information here.
The university acknowledges that some individuals have health conditions or other reasons why they cannot be vaccinated.
If you are required to test, you will need to continue to do so until your COVID-19 vaccine record has been verified.
If you have reviewed the information above, and you still have questions or concerns, please contact the COVID Wellness Answer Center via email at covidwellness@illinois.edu or call 217-333-1900.
Please note that even individuals who have a verified Vaccination Record Card on file will still have full access to the COVID-19 testing program and may continue testing.
In order to implement COVID-related guidelines and policies affecting university operations, supervisors may ask students if they are fully vaccinated. But no one should ask to see proof of vaccination in someone’s Safer Illinois app. You are required only to show the building access screen, which shows compliance without specifying whether it was through COVID-19 vaccination or regular on-campus testing. This screen does not say if a person is vaccinated or not. University officials should not ask students why they are not vaccinated or any other questions seeking personal health information.
Thank you for your continued patience and understanding as we work through these details of the next phase of COVID-19 pandemic. We anticipate announcing more details about the Fall 2021 semester in the coming weeks.

        Dear colleagues:
I am delighted that President Biden and Governor Pritzker each signed legislation this week declaring Juneteenth a holiday on both the federal and state levels.
It gives much-deserved respect to one of the most significant dates in our nation’s history – June 19, the date that the last enslaved African-Americans were freed in Texas in 1865. It will also heighten education on the importance of the holiday and continue moving us closer to the social equity and justice that our country must achieve.
We are excited to add this to our holiday schedule for June 2022. Details about the observed date will be forthcoming.
I hope you will all join me in applauding our leadership in Washington and Springfield for giving us a chance to reflect and recommit to the goals of equality and justice that we all share.

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
As you know, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has announced that the State of Illinois will move into Phase 5 of the Restore Illinois plan tomorrow, Friday, June 11. I’m writing to share guidance about what this will mean for our university community:
Classrooms during Summer Session 2021
Summer in-person classes will continue to require students and faculty to wear facial coverings and practice social distancing when they are in the classroom during the class period.
Classrooms during Fall 2021 
The university is still considering what this new guidance will mean for Fall 2021 classes. We will announce more details in the coming weeks.
Face Coverings/Social Distancing
Based on CDC guidance, faculty, staff and students who are fully vaccinated (defined as 14 days after final dose) are not required to wear a face covering or practice social distancing in university spaces except for healthcare settings or facilities that operate under additional federal and state regulations. See more information here.
People who are not fully vaccinated are required to wear a face covering in university spaces indoors, as well as outdoors when they cannot practice social distancing.
University Facilities
The new Phase 5 guidance replaces industry-specific guidance from the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO). There are no longer limits on space capacity, etc. See more information here.
University spaces that serve the university community or the public may open or continue to be open, as long as they have updated signage to indicate that people who are not fully vaccinated are required to wear a face covering in university spaces.
Compliance
At this time, compliance will be enforced on the honor system, and we expect you to be honest as we seek to protect each other’s well-being.
In order to implement COVID-related guidelines and policies affecting university operations, supervisors may ask employees if they are fully vaccinated.
Supervisors may not ask employees why they are not vaccinated or ask any other questions seeking the employee’s personal health information.
COVID-19 Testing
For now, all COVID-19 testing requirements are still in place. If you live in University Housing or are participating in on-campus activities, you should continue your on-campus COVID-19 testing schedule, even if you are fully vaccinated.
In the future, the university plans to use an individual’s verified Vaccination Record Card to replace regular COVID-19 testing for compliance and building access. When this new policy goes into effect, we will send another announcement.
We encourage members of the university community to be vaccinated if and when they are able to do so. If you have not been vaccinated and you want to make an appointment, please find information on the university’s COVID-19 website. We also acknowledge that some individuals have health conditions or other reasons why they cannot be vaccinated.
The university will continue to take guidance on COVID-19 safety protocols from the CDC, IDPH, CUPHD and our own SHIELD team. We will continue to monitor the status and spread of COVID-19 on our campus and be prepared to pivot our approach if necessary.
We are at a critical period of the COVID-19 pandemic, when we need to demonstrate our commitment to one another by being honest and compassionate. Thank you for continuing to make decisions that maximize the safety of our entire community.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                June 1, 2021 4:16 PM
			
        Dear faculty, staff, students and friends:
Over the holiday weekend, the Illinois legislature approved a budget for the coming fiscal year that would hold state appropriations at current-year levels for the University of Illinois System. The proposed budget will be sent to Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who is expected to sign it into law.
It marks the second straight year that legislators and the governor have maintained funding despite the financial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we are grateful to them for investing in higher education and its power to move Illinois forward.
The $42.3 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 also re-appropriates capital funding to support key construction projects. That includes funding for development of our Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) and Illinois Innovation Network (IIN), along with major projects at each of our universities.
Highlights of the budget include:
An appropriation of $622 million for operations, matching state funding for the current fiscal year.
Re-appropriation of capital funding for planning and construction of DPI and 15 IIN research hubs across the state, including one at each of our universities and satellite campuses. Overall, the state has committed $500 million for the projects, and released about $142 million late last year in the first round of funding.
Re-appropriation of $807 million to fund capital improvements at all three universities. Major projects include renovation of Altgeld Hall for a math, statistics and data science collaboration center in Urbana-Champaign; a quantum sciences initiative that Urbana is developing in partnership with the University of Chicago, Argonne and FermiLab; the Advanced Chemical Technical Building at UIC and a computer design research and learning center for UIC’s College of Engineering; and a new facility at UIS that will replace the existing library, along with a new Public Safety Building.
Appropriation of $65 million in new capital funding to expand patient-care services at the University of Illinois Hospital. One crucial project will create a new clinical decision unit, or CDU, adjacent to the hospital’s emergency room to rapidly screen and test incoming patients. The unit will identify patients most at risk of issues such as heart attack, stroke or infectious disease, including COVID, allowing rapid, life-saving treatment and isolation to prevent spread of disease. The funding will also support much-needed upgrades of the hospital’s 42-year-old emergency room to meet today’s patient needs and expand the Cancer Care Center to make it a multi-specialty clinic.
Appropriation of $8 million to support the world’s largest carbon capture research program at City Water Light and Power in Springfield. Our Prairie Research Institute will be part of the $67 million U.S. Department of Energy study on how to decrease carbon emissions into the atmosphere.
A $28 million funding increase for the Monetary Award Program (MAP), which provides financial aid to support Illinois students, including thousands at our three universities.
The legislature also approved funding at current levels for the fourth year of a state scholarship program created to encourage in-state students to attend college in Illinois and stem an outmigration of talent to other states. The U of I System and other universities provide matching funds to double the impact of the state’s contribution.
The U of I System advocated for increased funding to support a flagship university system that has set enrollment records for eight straight years and has played a key role in helping the state navigate the COVID crisis. But we understand the financial challenges the pandemic has created and the shared sacrifice that is required to pave the way to recovery. We will resume our push for additional funding next year – funding that is essential to ensure faculty hiring keeps pace with growing enrollment and maintains the academic excellence that our students expect.
We are grateful to Gov. Pritzker, the legislature and our U of I Caucus for their support during this budget process, and to all of you for everything you do to make the U of I System a key engine of progress for the people of Illinois.

More details on this effort are forthcoming. Testing through SHIELD CU is funded through an agreement between the Illinois Department of Public Health and University of Illinois System.
Changes to SHIELD CU testing for university families and households
Starting immediately, testing at the State Farm Center is available free of charge to university families and households.
University family and household members who have already tested at the State Farm Center through SHIELD CU in April and May will not be billed for their tests.
Parents or legal guardians must accompany minors (ages 8-17) and complete a paper consent form at the testing site the first time a minor tests. Minors who have previously tested through SHIELD CU will also need to complete a one-time paper consent form.
Faculty, staff and students are no longer required to provide authorization for their family or household members to test. Participants are encouraged to register using the Safer Community app before testing. Please note the Safer Community App is a different app than the Safer Illinois app used for university employees and students.
All individuals who have previously joined the University of Illinois employee family member group in the Safer Community App will receive an app notification that states “Testing is now free in Champaign, you have been removed from the family member group.” After selecting “Continue,” the user will proceed with the testing process as usual.  
SHIELD CU testing hours at the State Farm Center will remain the same. Hours are currently Tuesday, Thursday and Friday: 8 – 11:30 a.m. and noon – 4 p.m., Saturday: 8 a.m. – noon, Sunday: 10 a.m. – 2 p.m. Hours are subject to change, so please continue to check osfhealthcare.org/shield-cu. 
All University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign faculty, staff, and students participating in any on-campus activities must continue to test at on-campus COVID-19 testing locations.
Visit osfhealthcare.org/shield-cu for more information about SHIELD CU, the collaboration between University of Illinois and OSF HealthCare that is bringing COVID-19 saliva testing to the C-U community. If you have questions about registration, testing, test results, or the Safer Community app, please contact shield@osfhealthcare.org.
As we continue working towards widespread vaccination, COVID-19 testing remains an essential component of our community’s efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect the safety of all. We are thrilled to expand access to testing through SHIELD CU and to better meet the needs of our community.

                May 14, 2021 4:01 PM
			
        Dear faculty, staff and students,
As you likely have heard, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced yesterday that fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a face covering or practice social distancing. The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) has indicated that it will be revising state guidance to align with these changes.
While this is encouraging news, I also want to be clear that the COVID-19 pandemic has not ended, and we all need to continue to make decisions that maximize the safety of our entire community.
As the State of Illinois moves towards the anticipated June 11 transition to Phase 5 of the Restore Illinois COVID-response, many of our own COVID-19 rules and policies will remain in place.
At this point, all students, faculty and staff who live in University Housing or are participating in any on-campus activities are still required to be up-to-date on their on-campus COVID-19 testing. This is currently in place even for people who are fully vaccinated. As previously announced, this will change for the Fall 2021 semester. 
Here are some immediate university changes:
Effective immediately, the university no longer will require fully vaccinated people to wear face coverings or practice social distancing indoors or outdoors, except as noted below. Please note the definition of “fully vaccinated” is 14 days after final dose.
People who are not fully vaccinated will be required to wear a face covering and practice social distancing indoors and outdoors.
At this time, compliance with this new CDC guidance will be enforced on the honor system, and we are asking you to be honest with one another. In order to implement COVID-related guidelines and policies affecting university operations, supervisors may ask employees if they are fully vaccinated. Supervisors may not ask employees why they are not vaccinated or ask any other questions seeking the employee’s personal health information. 
Out of an abundance of caution in this new stage of the pandemic response, students, staff and faculty attending in-person classes for the Summer 2021 semester will be required to continue to wear face coverings and practice social distancing in instructional spaces. We are still considering what this new guidance will mean for Fall 2021 classes and other operations and activities.
Based on IDPH guidance, healthcare settings will continue to require people to wear face coverings and practice social distancing. McKinley Health Center will follow this guidance where appropriate.
We encourage members of the university community to be vaccinated if and when they are able to do so. If you have not been vaccinated and you want to make an appointment, please continue to check your university email for available appointments via massmails and check local pharmacy appointments at vaccinefinder.org.
We also acknowledge that some individuals have health conditions or other reasons why they cannot be vaccinated. Some fully vaccinated individuals may also choose to continue practicing social distancing and wearing face coverings. I encourage you to all be mindful of this as people make their individual choices.
We will continue to monitor the status and spread COVID-19 on our campus and be prepared to pivot our approach if necessary. We will also continue to take guidance on COVID-19 safety protocols from the CDC, IDPH, the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) and our own SHIELD team.
We are working quickly to update our existing resources with guidance and information. And in the coming days and weeks, we will continue to provide more information about any further adjustments or changes to our operations and policies. I ask everyone for your continued patience as we navigate this newest phase. If you have questions about any of these new changes, you can always email COVID-19@illinois.edu.
We have clearly reached a new milestone and all of us are hopeful that we are finally starting to see light at the end of this tunnel here in our community. But COVID-19 remains a significant threat to safety and to our society. We have gotten to this point because all of you have made the difficult choices along the way that prioritized the health and safety of your friends, colleagues, family members and the surrounding community. That commitment to one another and that collaborative and compassionate spirit are points of great pride for this entire university. You have my thanks and my greatest admiration.
I ask that we all continue to demonstrate that commitment and that care as we move into this summer of change and transition.
Sincerely
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                May 14, 2021 9:01 AM
			
        Dear colleagues: I am pleased to announce the authorization of a 2 percent, merit-based salary program for faculty, academic professional and civil service staff across the University of Illinois System, effective August 16, 2021.
This program was a top priority in our budget planning to enable much-deserved recognition for employees who received no increases this year due to the financial fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In addition, our three universities have been asked to establish their own guidelines for separate programs to address compression, market, equity and retention issues. Commitments for existing contractual agreements, promotions and equity adjustments will also be honored as part of this program. I have asked chancellors to monitor carefully any individual increases amounting to more than 7 percent at their universities and I will do the same at the system level.
Pay adjustments for faculty and staff in bargaining units will be determined by negotiations with the bargaining representative and/or applicable contract settlements, and are not subject to unilateral adjustments unless authorized or permitted pursuant to the collective bargaining process. 
I hope that the salary program, announced today, serves to illustrate just how much we value your hard work and sacrifice during the ongoing COVID crisis. Thanks to you, a year of historic challenges has also seen one of our greatest triumphs over adversity. You have made the U of I System a model for the nation, sustaining our world-class teaching and research while dealing with the many unique challenges that the pandemic brought to our institution and to your own lives and families.
You are the foundation of our excellence, and I am deeply grateful for your hard work, your flexibility and creativity, your dedication and your loyalty. Sincerely,  Tim"

        Dear Faculty,
As planning for Fall 2021 instruction begins, we are presented with the opportunity to reflect on all that we have learned over the last year about teaching and engaging students across different course modalities. We are pleased to announce the Illinois Summer Teaching Institute, an opportunity for faculty to review good practice, discuss different pedagogical approaches with colleagues and receive hands-on training. The focus of this year’s institute is on enhancing instruction through the use of multimodal approaches, innovative assessments and strategies for increasing student engagement. Here are some of the highlights:
Participants will design their fall courses in a community of fellow instructors with the support of faculty experts and campus experts from CITL, Tech Services and college-level educational technology units.
The institute will be delivered via Canvas from June 7 through June 27. Webinar recordings and other content will be available in Canvas to all instructors beginning in July. 
The institute will include twenty-four 30-minute webinars, asynchronous content and assignments that will build toward a completed fall syllabus.
Sample webinar topics include multimodal course design, easy interventions for improved engagement across modalities and high frequency/low stakes assessments.
Opportunities for one-on-one help will be offered both during and after the institute.
Details on eligibility, sign-up and compensation will be available soon through your department or college. 
Thank you for considering this opportunity to receive expert support in your fall course preparations.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

                May 12, 2021 12:01 PM
			
        Dear faculty and staff,
As you know, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker recently announced that the State of Illinois will move from Phase 4 to a Bridge to Phase 5 (Bridge Phase) on Friday, May 14. The biggest implication of this new guidance for the university community is that this expands capacity for events and spaces. We will follow the IDPH guidance in the “Bridge” column of this document.
Affected university spaces/events include:
Dining
Fitness facilities
Office spaces
Retail spaces
Festivals/outdoor spectator events
Conferences
Museums
Social events
Indoor spectator events
Outdoor spectator events
Please keep in mind that this will not change space or capacity guidelines already in place for Summer 2021 in-person classes.
For questions or concerns on how to interpret or implement these new expansions of capacity limits, please email covid-plan-review@illinois.edu.
Moving into the Bridge Phase is good news for our entire community, but we must continue to be as diligent as ever in safety precautions, including getting vaccinated if you are able, participating in regular COVID-19 testing, wearing face coverings, practicing social distancing, washing your hands frequently and avoiding large gatherings.
Mandatory on-campus testing requirements are still in place for people living in University Housing facilities or participating in any on-campus activities.
Even as we look forward to moving into Phase 5, which the governor said could happen as early as June 11, maximizing the health, safety and wellness of our entire community will continue to be a top priority. For the Fall 2021 semester, even if we are in Phase 5, we anticipate that the university will continue to require regular COVID-19 testing (except for those with a verified vaccination record). The university will also continue to require face coverings, social distancing, etc. aligned with IDPH guidelines for Phase 5.
We know frequent changes can be disruptive to you, so we intend to keep the current classroom assignments, capacity limits and course modality in place for all in-person classes during the Fall 2021 semester. Changes to in-person classes may be considered if COVID-19 conditions worsen and require more restrictive measures.
Thank you in advance for your patience and understanding as we work through this next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. I am grateful for your spirit, your resilience and your commitment to taking care of our community.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                May 6, 2021 1:00 PM
			
        Dear faculty and staff,
The university is issuing new travel guidelines based on information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the State of Illinois. Please see below for the updated travel guidance and requirements from Illinois Human Resources. This information is also available on the travel page of the university’s COVID-19 website.
The Office of the Provost has issued new guidance for student trip travel related to courses or learning experiences. See this guidance here.
The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation has issued new guidance for research travel. See the ""guidance for research-related travel"" section of the OVCRI website here.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost
Updated Travel Guidance 
International Travel
International travel on behalf of the university should only be approved for essential reasons when the objective of the travel cannot effectively be accomplished virtually. It requires approval by the respective Executive Officer (dean, vice provost, vice chancellor, etc.), and will be informed by the U.S. Department of State and CDC guidance on international travel advisories.
Domestic Travel
According to the CDC, the COVID-19 vaccine facilitates safer travel opportunities as fully vaccinated travelers are less likely to get and spread COVID-19. The CDC has issued guidance that states individuals who are fully vaccinated with an FDA-authorized vaccine can travel safely within the United States. 
This allows the university to relax some of the restriction on domestic university business travel. As of today, travel on behalf of the university will no longer need additional approvals, other than the standard approvals required pre-COVID (before March 2020). 
Please note the following guidance is applicable whether the travel is personal or university-sponsored business travel.
General Guidance for University Travelers
Assess the COVID-19 situation at your destination prior to departure to ensure travel to the location can be safely managed. This is particularly important if you are considering international travel as the restrictions are very fluid.
When possible, delay travel until you are fully vaccinated, which is two weeks after the second dose of a 2-dose series such as Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech, or 2 weeks after receiving a single dose vaccine, such as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
Maintain your university testing schedule prior to travel. Do not travel if you are ill or have tested positive for COVID-19. If you are not fully vaccinated, do not travel if still awaiting COVID-19 test results.
If you are not fully vaccinated, ensure that you test 48 hours before your departure and with enough time to receive your results before travel begins.
When traveling, continue to follow the CDC’s recommendations to:
Wear a face covering over your nose and mouth
Stay six feet from others and avoid crowds
Wash your hands often or use hand sanitizer
Monitor for any symptoms and quarantine if you suspect that you have COVID-19
Follow all country, state or local recommendations and requirements
Approval for business travel requests may be rescinded at any time up until the date that travel begins, particularly if the COVID-19 situation at your destination suddenly changes. Remember, face coverings are required. Face coverings are required on public transportation such as planes, buses and trains, when traveling into, within or out of the United States and in U.S. transportation hubs such as airports and stations, as well as at many venues and events.
After Travel
Fully vaccinated individuals do not need to self-quarantine after travel. Resume your university testing schedule, testing as soon as possible upon return.
Travelers who are NOT fully vaccinated need to self-quarantine for 7 days and get tested 3-5 days after your return.

                April 30, 2021 5:02 PM
			
        Dear colleagues:
I write to share the bittersweet news that Executive Vice President and Vice President for Academic Affairs Barb Wilson has been named the 22nd president of the University of Iowa, effective July 15.
It is a wonderful and richly deserved opportunity that will keep Barb just across the border, at a nationally ranked, Big Ten research university much like the one in Urbana-Champaign where she first joined us as a faculty member in 2000.
Ever since, her talents and passion have been lifting our students and our universities. She moved into campus-wide leadership in the provost’s office in 2009 and became the Harry E. Preble Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences in 2014. Later, she served for more than a year as interim chancellor in Urbana-Champaign, where she helped grow enrollment and programs despite the financial shortfalls of a state budget impasse.
In 2016, as Robert Jones was preparing to join us as chancellor, I named Barb as the University of Illinois System’s inaugural executive vice president. She has set the standard for excellence in the new role, helping lead efforts that include tuition freezes, increases in institutional financial aid, expanding our ranks of world-class faculty, establishing policies to promote safe and welcoming campus communities and shepherding a much-needed update of university statutes.
But as much as her many accomplishments, we will remember her warmth and kindness, her thoughtfulness and compassion, and her optimism and good humor. She has been an invaluable colleague and a deeply valued advisor and friend throughout my years here, and I know so many of you share those same feelings.
The news release below will be sent to media later today and I will update you as we develop plans to fill her position on an interim basis and to begin the search for a permanent successor.
In the meantime, I hope you will all join me in thanking Barb for her extraordinary service and wishing her and her husband, John Lammers, the very best in this exciting new chapter in their lives.
Sincerely,Tim
April 30, 2021
Barbara J. Wilson named president of the University of IowaSearch will begin to fill her current role as second-in-command of U of I System
Barbara J. Wilson, a longtime University of Illinois faculty member and administrator who has served as second-in-command of the U of I System since 2016, was unanimously approved as president of the University of Iowa today by the Board of Regents.
Wilson, currently executive vice president and vice president for academic affairs for the three-university U of I System, will take office July 15 as Iowa’s 22nd president. She will replace Bruce Harreld, who is stepping down in May after five years as president.
U of I System President Tim Killeen said an interim vice president will be named soon and will serve during a national search to fill Wilson’s current role as second-in-command, senior operating officer and chief academic officer of Illinois’ flagship university system.
“Barb’s talents and leadership are matched by her kindness, compassion and a rare ability to relate and connect with everyone,” Killeen said. “I am so sorry to see her go, but so grateful for her many contributions to our students, our universities and our excellence. I wish her the very best as she moves on to this new, richly deserved opportunity.”
Wilson, 63, first joined the faculty in 2000 at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), a peer institution of Iowa’s as a top-tier public research university and member of the Big Ten Conference.
She was interim chancellor of the 50,000-student UIUC campus in 2015-16, and earlier served as the Harry E. Preble Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences in Urbana-Champaign. Before becoming dean, she served as executive vice provost for faculty and academic affairs at UIUC, with a leadership role in campus strategic and financial planning. 
In 2016, Killeen named her to the newly restructured role of executive vice president and vice president for academic affairs. The position established a clear No. 2 executive to the president and added responsibilities as senior operating officer to traditional duties as chief academic officer.
Wilson worked closely with Killeen to advocate for the U of I System and elevate its national profile by building on connections with legislators, funding agencies and leaders in higher education, communities and industry.
Among her many achievements, she has helped plan and coordinate the system’s $6.7 billion operating budget, led an initiative that has added two dozen nationally recognized faculty members, and helped guide efforts that have held down tuition, increased institutional financial aid and pushed enrollment over 90,000 students for the first time last fall.
A professor of communication who was a member of the faculty at the University of California at Santa Barbara for 12 years, Wilson is an elected fellow of the International Communication Association. A three-degree alumna of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Wilson earned a bachelor’s degree in journalism and her master’s degree and Ph.D in communication.
###
The University of Illinois System is a world leader in research and discovery, and the largest educational institution in the state with more than 90,000 students, about 26,000 full-time equivalent faculty and staff, and universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield. The U of I System awards more than 23,000 undergraduate, graduate and professional degrees annually."

We know this semester remains challenging for you and our students as we continue to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic and we would like to share some resources for support.

                April 29, 2021 11:01 AM
			
        Dear faculty, staff and students,
In the future, the university plans to use an individual’s verified proof of being fully vaccinated (defined as 14 days after final dose) to replace regular COVID-19 testing for compliance and building access. This is a science-based recommendation from the Shield team based on what the vaccine research has shown so far.
This is expected to be in place before Aug. 23, the first day of the Fall 2021 semester. It is possible it could be available earlier – sometime this summer. When this new policy goes into effect, we will send another announcement. Individuals who do not submit vaccination records will continue to be required to participate in the COVID-19 on-campus testing program.
Please note that until this goes into effect, all university COVID-19 testing requirements will remain. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action.
If you are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, we encourage you to upload your COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card to the MyMcKinley Portal by taking a few simple steps. Please note if you received both vaccine doses at CRCE, you do not need to upload your record.
How to upload your COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card
Log into the MyMcKinley Portal: https://mymckinley.illinois.edu
Click on the “Forms” button in the menu header.
Choose “COVID-19 Vaccine Record Consent.”
Fill out the form.
Upload a photo of your completed COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card. (A cell phone image is fine.)
Click submit.
Note: International Vaccine Records require a certified English translation.
After you submit, the McKinley Health Center staff will verify the accuracy of your vaccine record. Once the upload has been reviewed and approved, your COVID-19 vaccines will appear under the Immunizations tab in your MyMcKinley Portal. Uploaded cards will be reviewed by mid-summer. If you have any issues, please email the COVID Wellness Answer Center at covidwellness@illinois.edu or call 217-333-1900.
If you have not been vaccinated and you want to make an appointment, please continue to check your university email for available appointments via massmails and check local pharmacy appointments at vaccinefinder.org. We encourage members of the university community to be vaccinated if and when they are able to do so. We also acknowledge that some individuals have health conditions or other reasons why they cannot be vaccinated.
Please note that we anticipate that all other COVID-19 guidelines will be in place, including wearing face coverings and practicing social distancing. We will continue to monitor COVID-19 on our campus and be prepared to pivot our approach if necessary. In the future, if we believe the science indicates that vaccinated individuals should continue testing, we will shift and mandate testing even for vaccinated individuals.
We will also continue to take guidance on COVID-19 safety protocols from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD).
Maximizing the health and safety of our entire community will continue to be our top priority, and we are optimistic that the coming months will bring more signs that the spread of COVID-19 is diminishing. Thank you for your continued patience and understanding as we continue to navigate this new phase of the pandemic together.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

In the two months since the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign announced the adoption of Canvas as its campus-wide, unified Learning Management System (LMS), campus leadership, eLearning professionals, and the Canvas Advisory and Steering Committees have been working diligently on behind-the-scenes preparations. We are excited to update you on the new resources available on the Canvas Transition Website, what you can do now to prepare to migrate your course(s), and what’s next. 
Updates to the Canvas Transition Website include: 
More in-depth information on the three different methods for migrating your courses—blank shell, manual migration, and automatic migration—and the pros and cons of each. 
Training opportunities, including summer workshops; online video resources; a self-paced Canvas 101 Faculty Orientation course covering the basics; online, subscription-based workshops and training resources offered through Canvas; and more. 
Charts comparing Blackboard to Canvas and Moodle to Canvas.
A features chart highlighting some of the top features you can use now to assist you with your content delivery and classroom structure. 
Instructions to Request a Canvas Development Space. 
Here are some things you can do now: 
Visit the Training Calendar and sign up for a “Building Courses in Canvas” workshop this summer. If you can’t attend a workshop, you can view recordings of previous sessions, review self-paced documentation, or request a consultation.   
Begin considering migration methods. If you want to get started now, you can use the blank shell or manual migration options. If you’re interested in automated migration, we recommend that you hang back and wait for more information, coming next month. 
Request a Canvas Development Space to use as a sandbox or explore building your course now. 
Next month, we will provide information on: 
Timeline and expectations for automatic migrations

More useful features in Canvas 
Please remember that although Compass will be available until June 2022, we encourage you to begin using Canvas as early as possible to give yourself more time to adapt to the new learning platform. As a bonus, your students will spend less time juggling courses over multiple platforms. We also encourage you to subscribe to the Canvas mailing list to receive future updates about Canvas migration plans.
If you have any questions, please contact us. We want to help make your transition as smooth as possible! 
Sincerely, Canvas Steering Committee"

        Dear students, faculty and staff:
The University of Illinois System welcomes President Biden’s publicly announced commitment to action on climate change, a serious and essential statement of the country’s resolve to lead in building a better, more sustainable future.
President Biden’s new plan to, among other things, cut U.S. emissions in half by 2030 also represents a call to the country’s centers of research and innovation for the bold ideas needed to make these goals reality.
The University of Illinois System and its three universities stand ready to help.
We bring to this endeavor a lengthy history of game-changing innovation and service as a willing partner with government in the kinds of collaborations that will animate President Biden’s vision.
Among our Guiding Principles that define the bedrock of the U of I System’s core values is a commitment to environmental sustainability. It is part of a greater accountability we have to individuals and communities on not just our campuses, but across Illinois, the nation and the world.
This Guiding Principle states, in part: “We will make the most of the U of I System’s wide-ranging and ever-evolving talents, encouraging collaborations among disciplines to produce not just breakthroughs, but sustainable environmental and economic improvements to the human condition.”
The U of I System and its universities have spearheaded so many breakthroughs that have helped drive the technological revolution, the world-class educational opportunities that have transformed lives and, over the past year, the ingenuity and innovation that have kept our research and educational enterprises thriving under the stress of a pandemic.
President Biden’s climate commitment presents another moment of both opportunity and obligation, one we are well-positioned and eager to meet.

                April 20, 2021 4:32 PM
			
        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
We hope today’s jury decision gives Mr. Floyd’s family some small sense of closure and a measure of justice. But no court can reverse his senseless death. And no verdict will erase their grief, anger and loss. Our thoughts are with his family and friends today.
Our collective compassion for those who are in pain must be equally matched by an urgent, firm, sustained public commitment to take action. As a university, as a community, as a nation and as individuals of conscience, we must fully and permanently dismantle the conditions of systemic racism and social injustice that play out so disastrously and disproportionately for too many families of people of color on a daily basis in our country.
While George Floyd’s death has catalyzed the necessary and urgent national reckoning on racial inequity, policing and the fundamental fairness of our justice system, our nation has seen other moments of reckoning that we have yet to heed, including the police killing of Eric Garner who uttered the words “I can’t breathe” nearly seven years ago. The deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Daunte Wright, Adam Toledo and too many others this past year alone are the unacceptable consequence of our current system of policing and criminal justice. Their deaths cannot be dismissed as isolated incidents or individual acts – they are clear and painful evidence that we are facing an embedded, societal crisis that we must directly and fundamentally address. Change will not happen without unrelenting effort.
As a part of our university’s Call to Action to Address Racism and Social Injustice launched in the wake of this year’s racialized violence, we are engaged in an active review of the role our own university has played in creating these systems, the histories that we have failed to address and the public safety processes and policies we have in place. Today we state unequivocally that we are ready to invest the resources, the time and the necessary effort to repair this damage and to reimagine and rebuild these systems. We are committed to making the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign a community where our research, engagement, equity, inclusion and leadership practices actively work to dismantle systems that utilize power, privilege and violence to disenfranchise and diminish, so that we can recognize the full humanity and lives of Black and Brown students, faculty and staff. This summer we will begin to bring the working group recommendations to the broader university community. These listening sessions will help us discuss the paths forward that we together will choose to prioritize through a collaborative process. We will provide more information about these sessions in the coming months, which will continue into the fall to allow all students who wish to participate an opportunity to share their perspectives.
This year, we have learned the names of too many, like George Floyd, who were taken in senseless ways. It is important that we remember them by committing to take actions that put an end to the systemic and embedded conditions that cost so many lives and bring such profound harm to the families and communities who are left behind. It is long past time.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

                April 7, 2021 8:17 AM
			
        Dear faculty, staff and students, 
We are pleased to invite members of your family and households to participate in COVID-19 testing through SHIELD CU beginning this Thursday, April 8. 
The previous program launch was delayed due to an unexpected minor technical issue with the Safer Community app. The issue has been fixed for both Apple and Android users. Several successful tests have now been performed, and we are pleased to extend testing at the State Farm Center to all family and household members of faculty, staff and students 8 years of age and older. 
SHIELD CU details for university family members
Family members must download, sign up and use the Safer Community app to be tested and receive results. Please make sure your family members use the latest version of the app.
Family members must enter the UIN of their university sponsor (faculty, staff or student) when prompted in the Safer Community app. The sponsor must then verify the relationship using their Safer Illinois app. This must be done before testing.
The cost will be $10 per test administered to a family or household member. The total for all tests administered to all family members will be charged to the university sponsor once per month. No fee will be charged for invalid tests.
Family members can only be tested at select lines designated for SHIELD CU at the State Farm Center testing site during designated hours. Hours are currently Tuesday, Thursday and Friday: 8 – 11:30 a.m. and noon – 4 p.m., Saturday: 8 a.m. – noon, Sunday: 10 a.m. – 2 p.m. Hours are subject to change, so please continue to check the website.
Tests are processed separately from campus testing. Please plan with the understanding that test results may take up to 48 hours.
University family members may begin testing on Thursday, April 8. 
Complete details, including FAQs about insurance coverage and travel, can be found at shieldcu.illinois.edu.
As always, thank you for your patience and participation as we work to maximize the safety of our community through the SHIELD CU program.

        Dear campus community member,
The Urbana campus will test its emergency notification system at 10:05 a.m. on Tuesday, April 6.
All campus community members are encouraged to sign up for Illini-Alert text messages to receive prompt notification of campus emergencies. You can do so by visiting http://emergency.illinois.edu. Contact information for friends and relatives may be added at http://go.illinois.edu/illinialertmyfamily. Anyone else can sign up by texting ""IlliniAlert"" to 226787.
The test of the Illini-Alert system will use all of the communication capabilities of the emergency notification system:
Email messages will be sent to all active faculty and staff members and students with campus email addresses.
Text messages will be sent to those people who have registered their cellphone numbers.  
A message will be sent to the Illini-Alert Twitter account (http://twitter.com/illinialert).
A message will appear on all digital signs connected to the Illini-Alert system.
The test does not require any response; evaluators will be able to monitor the speed and distribution rates of the messaging. Thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely,
Sherry Wooten

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
Last week, we sent a message announcing the launch of SHIELD CU and inviting family and household members of University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign faculty, staff and students to begin testing at the State Farm Center on April 2.
We are currently experiencing an unexpected minor technical issue with the Safer Community App, preventing family members with Android devices from being able to enroll in the program. The app provider has identified the issue and we expect it will be corrected within a day or two. Apple users and anyone already registered in the program are clear to test, but new Android users will need to watch for the new version of the app and download it before testing.
To ensure the best experience for your family and household members, we are delaying the program launch until a later date.
As always, thank you for your patience and understanding as we work to maximize the safety of our community through the SHIELD CU program.

        Dear faculty and staff,
As we navigate the remaining challenges of COVID-19, we are confident that our SHIELD safety protocols, the State of Illinois’ mitigation efforts and the increased availability of the vaccine will allow us to operate the Fall 2021 semester in ways that will continue to provide the experience that undergraduate students, in-residence graduate students, faculty, staff and others anticipated when they chose Illinois. COVID-19 has challenged us to develop new ways of providing basic instruction, student services, research collaborations and administrative support functions. We will draw on that experience as we return to in-person instruction, advising, student support, large-scale student events and research. We must all work together to deliver the world-class Illinois experience our students and other stakeholders expect. To that end, we have re-engaged our Return to Campus Operations work teams, who will finalize operational details by the end of this spring semester.
Planning for Academic Year 21-22
Based on our understanding of current public health guidance, we expect that by fall, COVID-19 health risks to our faculty, staff and students will be greatly minimized. Assuming that current projections of large-scale vaccinations and decreased infection rates are realized, our expectation is that campus will be safe for in-person service by the start of AY21-22.
This should allow the vast majority of faculty, staff and student employees who have been working remotely to return to campus.
We anticipate that local K-12 schools and daycare centers will be open, removing a significant challenge for many of our university community members in transitioning back to campus.
In anticipation of a return to in-person instruction and other activities in Academic Year 21-22, our Return to Campus Operations teams are revising and developing new processes, policies and guidelines in areas such as business, IT, HR, space utilization, operations and research.
This work complements our operational excellence initiative and will guide us in re-envisioning our workforce in ways that support a world-class, research-focused residential university fulfilling its land-grant mission.
This policy does not affect new or existing accommodations for a disability or medical condition. Such accommodations will continue to be handled by the Office for Access and Equity (OAE) under CAM policy HR-67. The ADA division of the Office of Access and Equity can be contacted via phone number at 217-333-0885 or more information can be found at oae.illinois.edu.
For AY 21-22, staff who have a need to initiate or continue remote work options not associated with a disability or personal health condition must work with their unit and submit a telecommuting request for approval. NOTE: We are not asking for new or updated Telecommuting Agreements at this time.
A new single, campus-wide electronic telecommuting request is being finalized and Illinois Human Resources (IHR) will provide more information prior to the start of AY21-22. Not every request for remote work will be granted. If a request for remote work cannot be granted, IHR can assist units and employees with the various leave options available.
Please click here for a summary of our AY21-22 guidance to shape your planning efforts.
Our goal is to provide students the experience they envisioned when they chose Illinois, to provide scholars the collaborative settings they need to conduct their work and to share the knowledge created at this university with the state, the nation and the world. While some of that work can be done remotely, we can leverage our strengths and serve our stakeholders best when we are able to access our facilities and our connections to each other in person. These efforts will be a key pillar of our organization for the next 150 years, and, together, we will continue to fulfill our land-grant mission of learning, discovery and engagement.

                April 1, 2021 9:10 AM
			
        Dear faculty and staff,
Currently the university is not requiring employees to be vaccinated for COVID-19. We encourage members of the university community to be vaccinated if and when they are able to do so. We also acknowledge that some individuals have health conditions or other reasons why they cannot be vaccinated.
Employees may be asked about their vaccination status as part of contact tracing efforts. All employees are directed to cooperate with these efforts in order to identify and reduce infection risks for members of our campus community or the surrounding area.
In addition, there may be aspects of campus operations that make it relevant for supervisors to ask employees to voluntarily disclose their vaccination status.
For example, state and federal health officials recently issued guidelines pertaining to fully vaccinated individuals that relax certain requirements for quarantine, interactions in groups, venue capacity and travel restrictions. “Fully vaccinated” means 14 days have passed since receiving your final dose of the vaccine. 
In order to implement COVID-related guidelines and policies affecting university operations, supervisors may ask employees if they are fully vaccinated. Supervisors may not ask employees why they are not vaccinated or ask any other questions seeking the employee’s personal health information. For example: 
Supervisors should not ask questions such as:
When are you getting vaccinated?
Why haven’t you been vaccinated for COVID-19?
Do you have a health-related reason for not being vaccinated?
If you have been vaccinated, why aren’t you returning to in-person work?

Supervisors may ask questions such as:
Are you willing to disclose whether you have been vaccinated for COVID-19?
Have you been vaccinated for COVID-19?

Supervisors should clarify how vaccination status is relevant to unit operations and ensure that employees who are not vaccinated (or who choose not to disclose their vaccination status) are not penalized or prevented from participating in the operations of the university.
Supervisors cannot require employees to return to in-person work solely because they are vaccinated. Moreover, if an employee has received an accommodation through the Office for Access and Equity (OAE), and the supervisor is not sure whether the accommodation is still necessary, they should contact OAE rather than taking it up with the employee directly. (CAM policy HR-67).
As more members of our campus community and the surrounding region are vaccinated, and as local, state, and federal policy and public health guidance evolves, we will continue to update our guidance for the campus community.
Thank you for your ongoing understanding and patience as we continue to navigate this evolving guidance.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear colleagues:
We are pleased to announce that additional paid days off will again be provided during the December/January holidays, reflecting just how much we appreciate everything you do – especially in this most stressful and challenging of years.
For the sixth straight year, employees who are eligible for leave benefits will receive three paid gift days for this year’s Reduced Service Days on December 29, 30 and 31. Combined with holidays, other paid time off and weekends, it will extend the year-end break from Friday, Dec. 24, through Monday, Jan. 3. Before the program began in 2016, employees had been required to draw from their annual pool of paid time off to be paid for the three Reduced Service Days.
Our universities, hospital and clinics, and system offices will follow up with more details, including how to report the gift days and how they can be used on different days by essential employees who must work on December 29, 30 or 31. For employees in union-represented bargaining units, paid time off for the holidays is addressed through the required collective bargaining process.
The additional paid time off is part of our ongoing efforts to show how much we appreciate your hard work, resiliency, sacrifice and commitment – qualities that have shone brightly throughout the COVID-19 crisis. In the face of extraordinary challenges both on the job and at home, you have come together to not only pull the University of Illinois System through the historic storm but to literally make it a model for the nation.
Thank you for helping write a remarkable new chapter in our more than 150-year legacy of excellence. We hope the coming months bring an end to the pandemic, a return to normal activities on our campuses and in your lives and a traditional, joy-filled holiday season with family and friends.

The distribution of a vaccine is welcome news, but we must continue to be as diligent as ever in safety precautions, including regular COVID-19 testing, wearing face coverings, social distancing, hand washing and avoiding large gatherings. Mandatory testing requirements are still in place for individuals who are fully vaccinated.
Thank you in advance for your understanding as we work through this next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and rely on the guidance of our public health leaders to make the best decisions for our community.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear students, faculty and staff,
This message is to make you aware of the plan for student fee assessment for Fall 2021. In Fall 2020 and Spring 2021, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, fee assessment was changed each semester in recognition of the reduced in-person services and course offerings.
In anticipation of a semester that will more closely resemble pre-pandemic conditions, Fall 2021 fees will return to standard assessment for students in campus-based programs. Fee assessment for fully online programs has been and remains unchanged.
More information about the Fall 2021 fee schedule can be found on the Office of the Registrar’s website:
Undergraduate
Graduate and Professional
We hope this notice will help students and their families in planning for costs of the upcoming Fall semester.

        Dear UIUC Community, 
 
I want to express how proud I am of everyone for sticking it out through a whole year of online learning. From one student to another I know it’s been especially hard. From having asynchronous classes to being cooped up in your dorm or apartment, this last year has been pretty bleak. In spite of all the challenges; we stayed strong as a community and have overcome these obstacles.  
 
I know that personally, not being able to see all my friends in person and hang out in the Union has put a damper on my college experience. It’s hard to describe how gloomy this past year has been, but that’s why I’m so proud of everyone for persevering. I really cannot express how much I appreciate everyone for their hard work. Thank you for being such an amazing community. It has been a wonderful year representing everyone, in spite of COVID, and I am happy I have had the opportunity to advocate for students.  
 
Remember, our dedication this year means that next year we can return to normality. I can’t wait to see you all next semester, hopefully in person. I, and the entire Illinois Student Government, thank you so much. 
 
Sincerely,

We are proud to know our university has helped fund causes benefitting our environment, health, human rights and so much more. This is evidence that even during a global pandemic, we can rise above the challenges of our time and lend a hand to those in need.

The cost will be $10 per test administered to a family or household member. The total for all tests administered to all family members will be charged to the university sponsor once per month. Read more about this here.
Family members can only be tested at select lines designated for SHIELD CU at the State Farm Center testing site.
University family members testing will begin on Friday, April 2.
University family members are one of the first groups given the opportunity to use SHIELD CU, an exciting partnership with OSF HealthCare to bring the university-developed SHIELD ecosystem to the local community. SHIELD CU plans to expand testing soon to other community groups, including local schools.

        Dear students, faculty and staff:
The tragic shootings last week in Atlanta and recent escalation of aggression toward Asians and Asian-Americans remind us all of one aspect of our bedrock land-grant mission: to provide a safe, welcoming place for education, opening doors to the opportunities that come with it, for people of every background.
The University of Illinois System reaffirms its commitment to provide this welcoming place for all of our students, faculty and staff, and that explicitly includes our Asian and Asian-American communities and families.
That idea that all are welcome at our three universities is embedded in our Guiding Principles:
“Diversity of backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences enriches campus conversations in and out of the classroom, inspires our creative endeavors, and drives innovative solutions to the world’s problems. Our capacity to listen to and learn from each other is fundamental to our mission of excellence in teaching, research, and learning – and to the cause of the common good.”
Rooted in our commitment to that common good is our belief that we as a state and a nation are stronger because of our diversity, that the many faces, cultures, backgrounds and ideas brought together here are vital to our strength.
We condemn violence and hate in any form, and are committed to diverse campus communities that help prepare students for the increasingly global workplace that awaits when they begin their careers.
We also remind you that resources are always available at all three universities for anyone who needs assistance in difficult times. As one community spread across our three universities and several locales, we encourage you to be respectful of differences, to look out for each other, and to care for yourselves.

        Dear Graduate Students,
Due to the exceptional circumstances under the pandemic, the Graduate College, with the support of the Chancellor and the Office of the Provost, has approved an emergency modification to the existing Summer Automatic Waiver Policy for 2021. This modification will extend the fee waivers under this policy to include partial coverage of the Health Insurance Fee and full coverage of the Health Service Fee.
The Summer Automatic Waiver Policy provides graduate students who do not have a summer waiver-generating appointment, but who held one in the previous spring, a summer automatic waiver if they register in the summer term.
As a result of the emergency modification for Summer 2021, a summer automatic waiver will provide the same tuition waiver granted during Spring 2021 plus a waiver for the following fees: Service Fee, AFMFA Fee, Library/Technology Fee, 87% of the Health Insurance Fee and full waiver of the Health Service Fee.
This plan underscores our campus commitment to assisting our students to navigate the many challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional information about the program and about summer health coverage is available on the Graduate College website.

As you know, this Wednesday, March 24 is the next non-instruction day in the modified Spring 2021 academic calendar. As a reminder, non-instruction days are to be left entirely free of any mandatory course obligations. This also means work should not be increased immediately before or after these days in a way that does not allow for a break. These days are intended to provide important and necessary rest for our students.
Students, if you have concerns regarding course obligations on these non-instruction days, you are encouraged to contact the head or chair of the department offering the course. Department head/chair names and contact information can be accessed by selecting the course subject in the Spring 2021 Class Schedule and clicking on that subject. The head/chair of department and contact information is listed at the top of the page, above all course numbers and titles offered in that subject. 
Instructors, I encourage you to once again review your course syllabus and schedule to be sure there are no exams, assignments or required class meetings on these non-instruction days. Without a week-long spring break this semester and given the heightened stress associated with the ongoing pandemic, we all appreciate how critical these days are to our students’ wellness. Also, let me take this opportunity to remind you of this guide from the University of Illinois System on supporting students’ wellbeing and promoting a sense of community during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Thank you all for your understanding and patience as we continue to navigate another challenging semester. I am most grateful for your continued compassion for one another and your commitment to the wellbeing of everyone in the community.

        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
I am excited to announce the inaugural call for proposals for the Call to Action Research Program, one of the foundational components of our university-wide Call to Action to Address Racism and Social Injustice. The full request for proposals (RFP) along with the application details can be found here.
We will be holding two online, public information sessions about the program and the proposal submission process. Registration is required.
 Call to Action Research Program Information Sessions and Registration Link
Tuesday, March 30 at noon
Wednesday, March 31 at 4 p.m.
This program begins with a $2 million investment to fund competitively awarded grants that enhance our exceptional cross-disciplinary scholarly strengths and expand community collaborations to build cultures of research that address structures of racism and injustice.
This first call will focus on three critical research areas:
Systemic racism and social justice
Law enforcement and criminal justice reform
Disparities in health and health care
Proposals can be submitted along three different funding tracks, each with a maximum award level.
Community-Based Innovation projects (up to $25,000)
Systemic Institutional Change projects (up to $75,000)
Societal Impact projects (up to $100,000)
Tenure, tenure-track and specialized faculty with appointments in any academic college or research unit in the university are eligible to apply in any of the three tracks. The Community-Based Innovation track is also open to university staff members, members of the community and other non-university organizations, as long as applications are in collaboration with an Illinois faculty or specialized faculty member.
The first step in the competitive process is submission of a brief pre-proposal that describes the proposed project, the objectives and how it connects to the broader Call to Action goals. Pre-proposals are due by April 26, 2021. Projects selected to move to the full proposal stage will be invited to do so with a deadline of June 4, 2021.
The Call to Action to Address Racism and Social Injustice Research Program is an important step forward as we seek to transform the way our own university supports, prioritizes and recognizes the research of scholars working on issues of systemic racism and bias in the United States. 
I hope you will attend one of the information sessions, and I encourage you to look to others across this university and around our entire community to join you in submitting a proposal for this inaugural round of funding.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                March 18, 2021 9:58 AM
			
        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
The news of Tuesday's shooting of eight people, six of Asian descent, in the Atlanta area is difficult to watch. While we may not yet know the details behind this tragic violence, the anxiety and sense of unease during a period of a sharp rise in anti-Asian and anti-Asian American violence cannot be ignored. According to the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, incidents of anti-Asian hate and bias increased 149% in 2020, while overall hate crimes dropped 7%.
As the Office of Inclusion & Intercultural Relations observed in their statement earlier this month, xenophobia and anti-Asian racism have an entrenched, systemic history in our nation. The resurgence of these anti-Asian patterns of discrimination and hate throughout the past year only intensifies the need for us to stand in clear solidarity against all forms of violence, misogyny and bias. Ensuring equity for every member of our society is essential to the health and well-being of each one of us. Our community must stand together united in support of one another. As a university that researches the roots of racial injustice, health and economic disparities, we must also reject the targeting, blame and scapegoating of racism and xenophobia. Above all, we are committed to providing a safe, open and welcoming environment for all members of our community.
One’s race, ethnicity, identity, religion or national origin should never be used as a threat against anyone’s physical or emotional safety. If you experience an incident of bias or discrimination in our community, please report it to the Bias Assessment and Response Team at bart.illinois.edu. Additionally, the Asian American Cultural Center will be hosting a workshop on how to intervene to stop anti-Asian American harassment and xenophobia. For more information, please visit their webpage at oiir.illinois.edu/aacc.
The success of our university rests firmly on the principle of inviting the best and brightest into our community and supporting each and every person’s capacity to thrive. At Illinois, we bring the world to Urbana-Champaign where the sharing of diverse perspectives, life experiences and ideas transforms lives. To our Asian and Asian American students, faculty, staff and community members, we want you to know that you are not alone. We recognize the collective anxiety, fear and trauma that can result from violent acts, even those committed hundreds or thousands of miles away. We stand with you in solidarity as we continue the work necessary to advance the values of equity and inclusion for all.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign will soon launch a second COVID-19 emergency grant program for graduate students.
The program is funded in large part by the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) II, which is part of the Federal Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSAA), 2021.
These grants are dedicated to helping graduate students who demonstrate exceptional need. Grants can be used toward the cost of education and other emergency costs that have arisen due to the coronavirus, such as tuition, food, housing, health care (including mental health care) or child care. 
Grants for graduate students will be available in amounts between $500 and $1,000.
Degree-seeking students enrolled in any graduate program (including professional programs) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign are eligible to apply, regardless of nationality or citizenship status. Students must be registered during the Spring 2021 semester to qualify.
An application process for graduate students will be announced soon and will be available on The Graduate College website.

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
I’m writing to let you know that the Illini Success team has just released this year’s edition of the Illini Success report, an annual review of the first career destinations of our recent graduates. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, our graduates still found jobs, enrolled in graduate school or began volunteer programs on par with previous years. You can view the full report online here.
Here are a few of the highlights from the new report:
91% of our 2019-2020 graduates secured a job, graduate program or volunteer opportunity within six months of graduation.
75% of in-state graduates who began a job or graduate program said they remained in the state for those opportunities.
$65,178 is the average salary for full-time-employed graduates.
In this year when so many lives and jobs have been disrupted by the pandemic, it is gratifying to see that an Illinois degree provided so many of our recent graduates with a solid foundation for these critical first steps in their careers. While the survey response rate by graduates was a bit lower than our experience in typical years, the report reflects the outcomes of more than half of all graduates for that time period.  
This is fantastic news that illustrates the impact of an Illinois degree. I am incredibly proud of our recent graduates, and I am extremely thankful for our faculty and staff members who ensure that our students succeed.
I hope you will all join me in celebrating the success of our recent graduates.

                March 12, 2021 1:18 PM
			
        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
This fall our university released a Joint Statement on Anti-Semitism, in which we acknowledged and affirmed our belief in the rights of all members of the university community to express their viewpoints, identity and lived experiences, and committing to actions that make that possible. Part of our commitment includes the creation of a group of undergraduate and graduate students, staff, faculty and alumni, as well as representatives from the Jewish community, to help us advance our commitment to an inclusive community where anti-Semitism and all other forms of hate will not be tolerated and each one of us can live and thrive in our full humanity.
Today, I would like to share that I have charged the Chancellor’s Advisory Council on Jewish and Campus Life to assist my office in identifying opportunities to improve and sustain this commitment. The charge of this advisory council includes the following primary responsibilities:
To provide guidance on maintaining an inclusive and welcoming environment for all Jewish students, staff and faculty, and provide concrete recommendations for campus improvements to increase inclusion of all Jewish voices
To assess institutional resources and campus climate for Jewish students, staff and faculty to better understand the current state of individual experiences and institutional support
To support the relationships between the university and the Champaign-Urbana Jewish community, including but not limited to Illini Hillel, Illini Chabad and Sinai Temple
To provide direction on the development of focused and regularly recurring educational and co‑curricular programming, regarding Jewish student inclusion and anti-Semitism
This Advisory Council will be co-chaired by Erez Cohen, Executive Director of Hillel at the University of Illinois, and Richard Herman, former Chancellor of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The inaugural members of the Council include:
Steven Miller, Alumnus, Gies College of Business, 1987                                                            
Lorelei Rosenthal, Community Member, Rosenthal Manufacturing
Rabbi Dovid Tiechtel, Director, Chabad Center for Jewish Life
Lizy Mostowski, PhD Student, Liberal Arts & Sciences, 2023                                    
Tyeese Braslavsky, Student, Liberal Arts & Sciences, 2021                                       
Jared M. London, Student, Grainger College of Engineering, 2023                                      
Dana Rabin, Professor, Interim Chair of Department of History
Eugene Avrutin, Professor, Department of History
Michael Parrish, Assistant Director, Academic and Student Services, Gies College of Business
The full charge letter is available on the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion website.
Acts and expressions of anti-Semitism—in any form—actively undermine the educational process and are in direct opposition to our core values. It is our responsibility to create a university that not only addresses these acts when they occur but also actively supports and celebrates the ability of each student, faculty and staff member to bring their whole selves to the university community.
I’ve asked the Advisory Council to begin work immediately and to provide me with an update by May 31, 2021.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
We are delighted to share that through the overwhelming generosity of our alumni and friends and by virtue of the extraordinary vision of our academic leadership, we have reached our $2.25 billion With Illinois campaign goal!
While we are proud to reach this critically important milestone, our fundraising efforts will not stop. In addition to the respective priorities within each of the colleges and units, we will remain resolute in our commitment to secure private resources from now to the conclusion of the campaign in 2022 toward propelling bright minds, enabling our faculty to find solutions to the world’s challenges and elevating a university of distinction at the heart of Illinois.
We also remind everyone that reaching our goal doesn’t mean these dollars are immediately spendable or that we can use these funds for anything we choose. One-third of the gifts and commitments have been allocated towards our endowment while another one-third are deferred pledges that will be fulfilled over the coming years. The overwhelming majority of these funds have been given for specific purposes such as student scholarships, faculty support and capital projects and can’t be reallocated elsewhere.
The success of this campaign provides ample testimony to the appreciation our alumni have for their Alma Mater and the confidence our friends continue to bestow in the university’s mission. We invite you to celebrate with our entire Illinois family at with.illinois.edu/impact and learn more about the impact of With Illinois.
We are grateful for all your efforts in achieving this important milestone and appreciate your passion toward reaching even greater heights throughout the remainder of the campaign and beyond. Thank you for being With Illinois!
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

        Dear Colleagues, 
I write to share revisions to the COVID-19 testing requirements for graduate students that are effective immediately and shared in an email with graduate students earlier today. Graduate students who are not coming to campus are no longer required to test, with the exception of graduate students living in University Housing, including Orchard Downs, Ashton Woods and Goodwin-Green.
All graduate students who are coming to campus for any reason must continue to test in accordance with the COVID-19 testing policy. They must test and receive negative results at least every four days to maintain building access. All students and their adult dependents living in University Housing are required to continue testing and should continue to follow guidelines and notifications from University Housing.
Our COVID-19 testing program under the direction of SHIELD Team has been instrumental in keeping our campus and community safe throughout the pandemic. As the pandemic has changed, so has our response to it. While we are able to ease the testing requirement at this time, if circumstances change we may have to reconsider the testing policy. We believe that regular testing is good for our community and we encourage you to take advantage of it and to follow CDC, IPHD and CUPHD recommendations regarding safe practices during the pandemic. 
The university will continue to provide information for graduate students regarding building access status via the SAFER Illinois app. Graduate students should watch for COVID-related updates in Massmail and in GradLINKS. If you or your students have questions about testing, please visit the campus COVID-19 website or contact the COVID Wellness Team at covidwellness@illinois.edu.

        Dear students, faculty and staff,
As we quickly approach the halfway point of the spring semester, I write to announce our Commencement plans for celebrating Illinois graduates this spring. 2021 Commencement will include both an in-person individual, private Stage Crossing experience and an online celebration featuring a virtual conferral of degrees.
Commencement Stage Crossing Details
2021 and 2020 graduates will be invited to participate in the in-person individual, private Stage Crossing experience. This procession will be specific to each graduate.
Stage Crossings will take place Monday, May 10 – Monday, May 17 at the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts.
Graduates will sign up for a 15-minute time slot on one of these days. During the time slot, the graduate’s name will be announced as they cross a stage.
This celebration will not be college or unit-specific, offering graduates maximum flexibility to choose a timeframe most convenient for them.
Two guests will be allowed to accompany each graduate. Guests will be allowed to photograph their graduate.
Professional photographers will also be present to take formal portraits, and videographers will livestream and record the Stage Crossings.
There will be mandatory COVID-19 safety protocols for all who participate, including wearing face coverings and practicing social distancing. Additional information about these safety protocols will also be shared directly with graduates as they are finalized.
This email is intended as a save-the-date notification. 2021 and 2020 graduates can expect to receive more details about the Stage Crossing and the online celebration via email. Please continue to check the Commencement website for additional information.
All of our decisions related to events continue to be guided by the directives from the Illinois Department of Public Health and advice of our local public health officials. Graduates who cannot or choose not to attend the Stage Crossings are welcome to participate in the online celebration and other virtual experiences for graduates. When it is safe to resume large, in-person gatherings, we still intend to invite graduates from 2020 and 2021 to participate in an on-campus ceremony at Memorial Stadium.
We absolutely understand the importance of Commencement at Illinois, and we are committed to doing everything we can to celebrate the success of Illinois graduates while working to maximize the health and safety of our community. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we work to create experiences that honor our graduating students.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

I write to make you aware that planning for the Fall 2021 semester instruction is well underway. In addition to the success of our ongoing COVID-19 mitigation strategies, we are also encouraged by the success and growing availability of COVID-19 vaccines.
For the Fall semester, we are confident that we will be able to offer considerably more in-person instruction for our students than has been available during the current academic year.
Of course, the university will continue to follow guidance from the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD), the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as it evolves. We anticipate that existing COVID-19 mitigation strategies–face coverings, regular testing, contact tracing–will continue to be in effect during the fall semester.
Departments and colleges are currently developing the Fall 2021 class schedule. We expect the schedule to be available to view on Monday, April 5. Registration for continuing students for the Fall 2021 semester will begin on Monday, April 19.

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
The university has been working closely with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) to monitor local cases of a new COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) variant known as B.1.1.7. We know that this variant has already been detected among members of our university community.
We will continue to identify B.1.1.7 cases as they emerge. According to the CDC, this new variant, which was first detected in the U.K., is more infectious and will likely be the dominant variant of COVID-19 in the U.S. beginning this month.
With our rapid saliva test and frequent testing requirements, we have tools to maximize safety for our entire community, even with the emergence of this new variant. According to CUPHD, because the new variant is even more infectious, it will be vital that we all remain vigilant in our COVID-19 safety practices, including regular testing, practicing social distancing, wearing face coverings, frequent hand washing, etc. It is also more important than ever for individuals who test positive for COVID-19 to isolate immediately.
According to CUPHD, there is already evidence that COVID-19 vaccinations will help protect individuals from B.1.1.7,  but herd immunity with vaccinations will take time, and every effort is required to slow the spread of this and other variants. I strongly encourage you to be vaccinated when you receive a chance to do so. We are grateful to CUPHD for their vaccination leadership, and we will continue to share any vaccination opportunities for our faculty, staff and students.
We will continue to partner with CUPHD to update you on the emergence of B.1.1.7 and any change in guidance as we continue to learn more about this, and other, emerging variants.
Thank you for continuing to do your part to maximize the safety of our entire community.

                March 1, 2021 1:46 PM
			
        Dear Colleagues,
Recent extreme winter weather events and mass power outages nationally have reinforced the importance of comprehensive energy management strategies that can effectively meet societal demand and protect communities. For campus buildings and infrastructure, that responsibility belongs to Facilities & Services (F&S), which provides safety-focused, reliable, sustainable, and efficient utility service to students, faculty, and staff. Supplying uninterrupted heat, electricity, and chilled water are essential to supporting educational and research activities for the university’s learning, discovery, engagement, and economic development missions.
The F&S Energy Management Plan outlines how a $100M-a-year energy enterprise continues to transform and adapt to the evolving needs of the campus through enhancements in production, distribution, conservation, permitting, and business operations. The plan keeps the university on the path of achieving the milestone of a 50 percent reduction in energy use per square foot by 2026, fourteen years ahead of the Illinois Climate Action Plan (iCAP) target.
Over the next five years, key centralized programs, including retrocommissioning, recommissioning, energy performance contracting, along with supply-side equipment upgrades and net-zero space growth on campus will provide a projected additional energy savings of over 500,000 MMBTUs per year and approximately $13M in cost avoidance.
F&S staff have already made tremendous progress toward many specific iCAP objectives, such as reducing building-level energy, increasing clean power sources like solar and geothermal, and improving green building design and space utilization. These efforts greatly support the university’s climate leadership commitments to achieving carbon neutrality as soon as possible and strengthening resilience to climate change.
In all aspects of our operations, F&S is dedicated to advancing innovation and making service delivery improvements as a part of the Operational Excellence initiative in the university's Strategic Plan “The Next 150.” By creating partnerships and expanding outreach programs with the campus community, the organization will continue implementing integrated energy solutions and best practices that return better value and offer superior customer service.
Providing dependable and cost-effective utilities production and distribution is critical to securing the campus’ energy future, displaying dedicated environmental leadership, and further promoting world-class academic collaboration. Thanks to ongoing teamwork and detailed planning, we have made significant advancements over the last two decades and are well positioned for much success in the years ahead.
Cordially,

                February 24, 2021 10:02 AM
			
        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
To accelerate our efforts to recruit faculty of color to campus, the University is investing additional funds to support as many as 15 new Targets of Opportunity Program (TOP)-eligible hires through the 2022-2023 academic year.
This expansion of the TOP program is part of our institutional commitment to increasing faculty diversity as highlighted in The Next 150 Strategic Plan. These additional funds for faculty hires will enhance the comprehensive impact of the Call to Action to Address Racism and Social Injustice initiative being led by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. 
To distribute these funds, the campus will employ a modified faculty search waiver process, based on the procedures outlined in the Targets of Opportunity Program found here. The modified process includes two different opportunities this year for academic units to apply for faculty search waivers.
Colleges may submit proposals for “stand alone” or individual unit hires by March 22, 2021. We anticipate between eight and ten search waivers will be approved by this method.
Colleges may choose to submit proposals for a multi-unit, themed cluster strategy that connect with one of the campus priorities identified in the strategic plan. Proposals around a theme must include the participation of at least two different academic units. Cross-college partnerships and participation of our University’s research institutes and centers in the development of the proposals are strongly encouraged. We anticipate approval of between six and nine waivers by this method. Applications for themed cluster hires are due by May 1, 2021.
Full details, eligibility information and application instructions are outlined in Provost Communication #7: Targets of Opportunity Program (TOP). 
Please note that the process for the “TOP Traditional Search” remains unchanged. TOP candidates identified through existing approved searches remain eligible for campus support as outlined in Provost Communication #7. All units are encouraged and expected to develop the most diverse pool of candidates for their searches, and to leverage all opportunities to accelerate and increase their success in recruiting faculty of color.
This investment in the TOP program offers our academic units an additional tool in their efforts to recruit and retain faculty of color and further the diversity of excellence here at Illinois.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs & Provost"

                February 23, 2021 3:01 PM
			
        Dear faculty and staff,
After careful evaluation and research, we are pleased to share that we will adopt Canvas as the campus-supported Learning Management System (LMS) with full migration completed in June 2022. Click here to learn more.
Why We're Moving
For several years, our primary campus LMS has been Illinois Compass, a Blackboard product. Our current instance of Blackboard will retire in June 2022. We are using this opportunity to transition toward a common, modern LMS ecosystem to reduce frustrations, streamline support, and maximize future resources. Canvas has been identified as state-of-the-art in LMS platforms and is used by 11 of 14 institutions in the Big 10 Academic Alliance.
Importantly, we believe that adopting Canvas will aid in student success. One of the findings of multiple Student Success Initiative working groups was that the proliferation of LMS and LMS-like systems across campus was difficult for students to navigate. We are hopeful that a transition to Canvas will provide a strong foundational tool that we can build upon to aid in student success.
The selection of Canvas is the culmination of a review process that included a multi-semester, cross-campus pilot program as well as surveys and feedback from instructors and students.
We recognize that COVID-19 and activity related to online instruction makes the timing of this transition a challenge. In addition to providing training for instructors to utilize this new tool, we are actively working to automate many steps of the transition to ensure that we minimize time and effort while helping instructors take advantage of the benefits very quickly.
Transition Timeline
We are actively preparing for the transition now. Technology Services and the Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning (CITL) are in consultation with college educational technology experts.  We are establishing a Canvas Advisory Committee as well as a number of working groups in order to ensure a smooth transition. We are also in close contact with peer institutions who have recently made this transition, and their “lessons learned” have been extremely valuable in formulating our strategy.
The timeline for the transition is as follows:
Spring 2021 – Working groups, planning, preparation.
Summer 2021 – First group of courses migrate. Faculty training, workshops, and course migration support in full swing.
Fall 2021 – First group of courses utilizing Canvas. Second group of courses migrate.
Spring 2022 – Majority of courses migrated and utilizing Canvas.
Summer 2022 – Final set of courses migrate.
June 2022 – Migration to Canvas complete.
Stay Tuned
A formally structured and coordinated approach to implementing Canvas will ensure a smooth transition from Compass and other LMS platforms. In March, we will provide more details about training and timelines. Please review the Canvas Transition website for additional background and the most up-to-date information. We value your feedback. For any questions, concerns and suggestions, please contact us .
We look forward to sharing this next generation learning resource with the university community.
Sincerely,
Kevin PittsVice Provost for Undergraduate Education"

                February 22, 2021 9:01 AM
			
        Dear Members of the Campus Community,
I am delighted to share with you today that the Carle Illinois College of Medicine has been granted provisional accreditation by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) following an in-depth review of educational and program quality standards. Provisional accreditation moves the college’s novel engineering-based M.D. degree program one step closer to full accreditation in 2022. 
This provisional accreditation is a critically important step in the multistage process in which we must demonstrate that the College complies with LCME standards for educational quality, and provisional accreditation affirms that the Carle Illinois College of Medicine meets nationally accepted standards of educational quality. 
Carle Illinois gained preliminary accreditation from LCME in 2017 and welcomed 32 students for its first class in July 2018.
The full accreditation survey visit likely will happen when the inaugural class – the Carle Illinois class of 2022 – is in its final year, but the process may be delayed due to COVID-19.
Carle Illinois College of Medicine was created in 2015 as the world’s first medical college to incorporate engineering and technology principles into medical education, and it is the first new college created at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in more than 60 years.
This provisional accreditation is a great accomplishment and another historic milestone for a groundbreaking new kind of medical school. The post-COVID-19 world is going to need innovations in health care and medicine more than ever, and this is an important step in positioning Carle Illinois to lead the way.
Congratulations to Dean King Li and his team on this important achievement.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                February 17, 2021 1:44 PM
			
        Dear Colleagues,
It is with great sadness that we must tell you that Greg Gulick, Interim Chief Information Officer, passed away yesterday afternoon from COVID-19.
As Interim CIO, Greg led Technology Services in supporting, growing and improving the massive IT infrastructure that is a foundation for virtually every aspect of our university operations and missions. He joined the university in 2003 and spent most of his Illinois career in the department he came to lead.
We have both had the privilege of working closely with Greg for a number of years in our respective roles. We do not have enough words or space here to adequately describe his integrity, his expertise and skill and his dedication to our students, staff and faculty and the broader community. But to those of us who worked with him in any capacity, it was the quiet and constant kindness he showed to every person in every circumstance on every occasion that earned him such enormous respect and trust. And those qualities were needed more than ever in this year at Illinois.
Greg’s empowering and compassionate leadership during this COVID-19 year is a major reason why our university was able to reopen this fall and bring our students back to campus. As an integral member of our university COVID-19 Steering Committee and part of our SHIELD team, Greg was instrumental in guiding our decisions and actions in directions that always put the well-being and needs of our students, staff and faculty first. The extensive and complex technological infrastructure necessary to support our academic and research missions, to sustain remote work, to tackle and overcome challenges in remote teaching and learning and to sustain our testing ecosystem that was developed and implemented by his colleagues in Technology Services in close collaborations of all campus units has been nothing short of transformational this year.
It is a simple and honest fact that Greg’s tireless efforts throughout this devastating pandemic have helped protect every single one of us living, studying and working here on the campus and in our local community. We owe him our gratitude.
We have lost a university leader, a compassionate colleague and a friend.
We ask that you keep Greg’s family in your hearts and minds today.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

                February 16, 2021 2:47 PM

        Dear Colleagues,
Due to an extended stretch of severe winter weather and extremely high electric demand across the Midwest, Facilities & Services (F&S) is designating today through Monday, February 22, as an Energy Alert period for the Urbana campus. F&S requests that everyone conserve energy on campus to the greatest extent possible. If practical, shut off, shut down, sleep mode, or unplug the following:
Lights
Computers
Monitors
Printers
Chargers
Appliances
Other nonessential equipment
Close the following items to protect facility equipment and systems:    
Outside windows and doors in conditioned areas
Fume hood sashes when not in use
Continuous freezing temperatures throughout the week will substantially increase demand on the regional electric grid and require significant energy load optimization strategies from F&S’ Utilities & Energy Services division. Abbott Power Plant will continue to provide uninterrupted energy services to campus that are essential for research and teaching activities.
Why is energy conservation important to the university?
Conserving energy is everyone’s responsibility and supports the Illinois Climate Action Plan (iCAP) sustainability goals for energy efficiency. The combined efforts of individuals, departments, colleges, institutes, and schools are needed to increase energy awareness and further promote Operational Excellence in the university's Strategic Plan ""The Next 150.""
How does reducing energy use help steward resources?
Reducing the university’s energy consumption, especially during this time of peak demand, is critical to effectively managing resources. Abbott generates approximately half of the campus’ electricity through an efficient cogeneration process, simultaneously producing steam for heating and electricity. The remainder of the power is purchased from the regional grid. 
Thanks for your commitment to conserving energy across the Urbana campus. For temperature-related issues regarding specific rooms and building spaces, immediately contact the F&S Energy Management Control Center at fandsenergycomm@illinois.edu, 217-244-3783.
Cordially,

I want to share with you all two upcoming virtual events Illinois Student Government is hosting. We believe these events will enrich the student experience at UIUC and hope you will participate.
ISG and UIPD Town Hall
On Thursday, February 18 from 6:00–7:30 pm, Illinois Student Government (ISG) and University of Illinois Police Department (UIPD) will host a virtual Town Hall. The panel will be moderated by Student Body Vice President Christopher Ackerman-Avila and include UIPD Police Chief Alice Cary, Assistant Chief of Police Barbara Robbins, Sergeant James Carter, and Detective Tara Hurless. 
In the wake of the #BlackLivesMatter movement and murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, ISG has been working with UIPD to ensure vital reforms and adequate transparency.  
This Town Hall will be an opportunity for UIPD to provide updates but also space for students to get their pressing questions and demands answered.

ISG Free Speech vs Hate Speech Town Hall
On Tuesday, February 23 from 6:00-7:30 pm, Illinois Student Government (ISG) will be hosting a virtual Free Speech vs Hate Speech Town Hall.  This event will be moderated by the Executive Associate Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, Dr. Gioconda Guerra Pérez. The panel will include: 
Dr. Shawna Patterson-Stephens, Associate Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, Director of the Office of Inclusion and Intercultural Relations
Nizam Arain, Associate Vice Chancellor for Access and Equity
Justin Brown, Director of the Office for Student Conflict Resolution
Sarah Colomé, Director of the Women’s Resource Center
Dr. Janet Carter-Black, Professor for the College of Social Work
Jason Mazzone, Professor for the College of Law
This event has been organized by Campus Affairs Chairperson, Enoma Egiebor, and Committee on Diversity Equity and Inclusion Chairperson, Nicole Arnold. As chairpersons, their goal is to facilitate an open discussion about the distinct difference between hate speech and free speech. It is crucial the student body be aware of these processes as they impact everyone on campus. The rampant spread of hateful, false information can be fatal; therefore, it is crucial to understand what it is, what it is not, and the gray area.

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
As you know, this Wednesday, Feb. 17 is our first of three non-instruction days in the modified Spring 2021 academic calendar. As a reminder, non-instruction days are to be left entirely free of any mandatory course obligations. These days are intended to provide important and necessary breaks for our students.
Students, if you have concerns regarding course obligations on these non-instruction days, you are encouraged to contact the head or chair of the department offering the course. Department head names and contact information can be accessed by selecting the course subject in the Spring 2021 Class Schedule and clicking on that subject. The head of department and contact information is listed at the top of the page, above all course numbers and titles offered in that subject.
Instructors, I encourage you to once again review your course syllabus and schedule to be sure there are no exams, assignments or required class meetings on these days. Without a week-long spring break this semester and given the heightened stress associated with the ongoing pandemic, it is critically important to our students’ wellness to honor these non-instruction days. Please continue to be mindful throughout the semester as well, and please also review this guide from the University of Illinois System on supporting students’ wellbeing and promoting a sense of community during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Thank you all for your understanding and patience as we continue to navigate another challenging semester. I am most grateful for your continued compassion for one another and your commitment to the wellbeing of everyone in the community.

        A Winter Storm Warning remains in effect for Champaign and surrounding counties until 6 a.m. on Tuesday. Total snow accumulation of between 4 to 8 inches is anticipated as part of this storm system, along with winds gusting up to 25 mph.
Your patience and cooperation are appreciated as Facilities & Services staff perform snow and ice removal to keep the campus open and accessible by clearing sidewalks, building entrances, pathways, bike lanes, parking lots, and roads throughout the winter weather event.
Please exercise caution if you must travel during this period. The snowfall will make for slippery road and sidewalk conditions and hazardous travel. Blowing and drifting snow will likely cause slick spots and some persistent snow/ice areas.
Snow Priority Parking Lots
As a reminder, the following priority parking lots will be cleared first and regularly maintained during the event. Individuals are encouraged to use these lots along with MTD service until smaller lots are cleared: 
Lot B4, Levels Four and Five (North Campus) – Parking facility at the corner of University Avenue and Mathews Avenue
Shuttle Lot E14 (South Campus) –  West of the State Farm Center, south end only
Lot F27 (South Campus) – Adjacent to the Veterinary Medicine Basic Sciences Building
Vehicles parked in priority lots B4, E14, and F27 with a valid virtual permit for other rental facilities will not be cited for violations.
More information about university snow/ice removal efforts is available at https://go.fs.illinois.edu/snow. To report areas for treatment or if you have questions, contact the F&S Service Office fsserviceoffice@illinois.edu, 217-333-0340.

The University of Illinois Police Department is investigating the incident and will take appropriate action if those responsible are identified.
As a campus community, we cannot allow disrespectful and hostile acts such as this to happen without comment and condemnation. Anonymous, targeted vandalism of expressions of personal and national identity create a climate of fear and distrust, threatening a sense of inclusion and safety that is foundational to our campus community. It is our responsibility to speak together to say loudly and clearly that this behavior is antithetical to the values of our university, and that anti-Semitism in any form will not be tolerated.
We must not only respond to incidents such as this with condemnation, but also actively create a campus community where these incidents do not occur, and I want to be as transparent as I can about incidents of intolerance and hate when they happen and our response to them. To do the work needed to live our community values, we are committed to the actions outlined in the Joint Statement on Anti-Semitism released in November, including the creation of an Advisory Council on Jewish and Campus Life. We are now moving swiftly to organize and confirm the full membership of the council, and we will announce the members in the near future.
We are also conducting listening sessions that began during the fall semester, as part of ongoing efforts to be supportive and responsive to the needs of Jewish students, faculty and staff. We invite all members of our community to bring their whole selves to Illinois. For this to be realized, we must ensure that each person is not deprived of the chance to live and learn in an atmosphere free of fear and intimidation. All members of the university community have the right to express their viewpoints, identity and lived experiences, and we stand united against all forms of anti-Semitism.
We are still gathering information about this recent incident, and we will share additional information about the Advisory Council soon. If you experience an incident of bias or discrimination in our community, please report it to the Bias Assessment and Response Team.
Sincerely,
Sean C. GarrickVice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion"

        Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,
Last week the university experienced two phishing campaigns that targeted students. We would like to remind everyone to be vigilant and careful with email. Cybercriminals are constantly seeking to compromise your account, steal your data, steal your money, or worse, steal your identity.
If an email asks for personal information (full name, mailing address, phone number, etc.), do not provide it. If an email describes an offer that seems too good to be true, it probably is. If an email from an unknown sender contains a link, an attachment or misspellings, use extra caution.
Simply put, if it looks strange or out of the ordinary, delete it. Report it to the Help Desk at consult@illinois.edu or report it to an IT Professional.
Technology Services has an informational web page where you can learn more about protecting yourself from phishing and related scams. You can find it at https://techservices.illinois.edu/security/phishing

                February 10, 2021 2:25 PM
			
        Dear university community,
In response to stress and anxiety associated with the ongoing COVID-19 environment, and with approval by the Academic Senate, we are implementing the following academic policy modifications effective immediately for the Spring 2021 semester.
Drop Deadlines
The deadlines to drop a course without a grade of W and, for undergraduates, to use the campus Grade Replacement Policy, has been extended to the last day of instruction as follows:
1st 8-week (POTA) courses – Friday, March 19, 2021 at 11:59 p.m. Central Time.
2nd 8-week (POTB) courses – Wednesday, May 5, 2021 at 11:59 p.m. Central Time.
Full-semester (POT1) courses – Wednesday, May 5, 2021 at 11:59 p.m. Central Time.
Nonstandard courses – Last date of instruction, 11:59 p.m. Central Time.

Most course drops can be performed through Self-Service until 11:59 p.m. CST on the last day of instruction unless the drop puts the student below full-time enrollment status.
Extension of the drop deadline does not change the refund schedule.
Students who drop a course via Self-Service or who withdraw completely from the university on or before the drop deadline will not receive W (withdrawal) grades. Students who successfully petition their college for a drop of a course or who withdraw from the semester after the drop deadline will receive W grades.
Pass COVID/No Pass COVID
Pass COVID/No Pass COVID (PZ/NZ) grade mode options will be available, replacing the Credit/No Credit grade mode for the Spring 2021 semester.
Pass COVID (PZ) will apply to grades of D- or higher, will earn course credit and can be used to fulfill major, minor and general education requirements.
No Pass COVID (NZ) equates to a failing grade and does not earn course credit.
Pass COVID/No Pass COVID grades do not factor into a student’s GPA.
Undergraduates will be able to select Pass COVID/No Pass COVID after final grades are available in Self-Service. The selection period, May 22-27, gives a 6-day window for students to decide if they want to exchange their letter grade for the PZ/NZ grade mode.
Graduate students will work with the Graduate College to submit requests for use of the PZ/NZ grade mode.
The deadline for undergraduate and graduate students to elect or rescind PZ/NZ grading is Thursday, May 27, 2021 at 11:59 p.m. Central Time.
PZ/NZ grading is not available to students in College of Law programs or students enrolled in the MD or DVM programs.
Grades of F that are the result of an academic integrity violation sanction are not eligible for this option.
In making decisions about dropping courses or these options, consultation with academic advisors, college offices and the Office of Student Financial Aid for students receiving aid is strongly encouraged. As is always the case, students facing exceptionally difficult or unexpected circumstances that may require other accommodations continue to have the option to seek assistance through their college office.
A more detailed FAQ will be available on the Office of the Provost’s policies website within the next few days. We thank the Academic Senate for their important and timely role in implementing these policy modifications.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

        Dear Students,
As you know, in the past several weeks, the university has successfully completed our re-entry testing program for the Spring 2021 semester. We are going to lift the essential activities only guidance beginning today. Thank you for doing your part to maximize the safety of our entire community.
However, I encourage you to still use extreme caution when interacting in your daily lives. We know that the highly contagious B117 COVID-19 variant has already been confirmed at our university. And we have already seen a small spike that resulted from people violating safety protocols. Throughout this semester, it is absolutely critical that we continue to work together.
I know this essential activities only guidance has been difficult. And it is my intention that allowing you more freedom to leave your residence and interact safely will be welcome news. I know you came to this great and diverse university to connect with others and have rich experiences. I want to provide as much of that as possible – within boundaries designed to maximize your health and safety. In this spirit, the university is planning events and activities for you to safely interact. We will also provide guidance on planning your own safe social interactions. You can expect to hear more details in the coming days.
Please do not take this as an invitation to break COVID-19 safety guidance and have parties. We know that if this happens, our positivity rates will spike, and those who participate could suffer health risks, face university discipline, and the university will be forced to enact another essential activities only period. I do not want this. You do not want this. Please help me in encouraging your friends and peers to continue to be vigilant.
As your chancellor, I sincerely hope and believe the end of this pandemic is nearer. More vaccines are being administered each day in our state and in our community. We continue to have the absolute best public health district in the state. Please help me in being diligent until this pandemic is just a memory for us all. I am counting on you all to help me and to help one another.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Colleagues,
As we finalize our review applications for admission for the Fall 2021 semester, in cooperation with the Senate Committee on Admissions, we would like to remind you of the university policies regarding admissions confidentiality and third-party inquiries. Admissions officers may discuss a student’s application only with the applicant, the applicant’s parents/legal guardian, spouse or school-appointed counselor. Other individuals, including university employees without admissions responsibilities, are not permitted to inquire about a student’s application with a university admissions officer, and admissions officers are prohibited from sharing information with third parties regarding a student’s application.
A university admissions officer is considered anyone with admissions responsibility. This includes not only admissions staff in central admissions units such as the Office of Undergraduate Admissions and the Graduate College, but also faculty and staff within academic college and departmental offices responsible for reviewing and making decision recommendations for applicants. A firewall has been placed around faculty, administrators and admissions staff with admissions responsibility so that those without admissions responsibility may not influence decisions. Unsolicited letters of recommendation, support or appeal are not accepted or considered in our processes. Please review this Summary of University of Illinois Admissions Firewall Practices for a complete list of inquiries that are and are not permitted, as well as examples of scenarios and appropriate responses.
At the graduate level, it is important to note that those with admissions responsibility are allowed to accept information from an applicant’s recommenders in the form of formal letters, emails and phone communications; however, they may not discuss the applicant’s admission status with the recommender. If they are contacted about an applicant’s admission status by a recommender, they are to notify the recommender that while they may accept supporting information for the applicant’s file, they may not discuss the applicant’s admission status without expressed written permission from the applicant. Also at the graduate level, the Graduate College discourages any discussions with an applicant’s parent and/or spouse regarding the applicant’s status without the written permission from the applicant.
Inappropriate activities or attempts to circumvent these policies should be reported to the Ethics Officer or reported anonymously using the anonymous report feature of the Admissions Inquiry Log.
Thank you for helping to protect the integrity of our admissions process.

Andrew Borst Director of Undergraduate AdmissionsOffice of Undergraduate Admissions

        Colleagues,Technology Services Privacy and Security has developed a new online, self-paced security awareness training program. The goals are encouraging learning and better protecting you and the University from cyber threat.
Beginning in July 2021 all faculty, staff, and researchers will be required to complete annual security, privacy and data awareness training. The University is requiring such training because:
We wish to help the campus community stay current and aware so that individuals do not become victims, inadvertently mishandle data, or go astray of policies or laws.
Not having such a training program impacts potential access to both federal and private sector grants. There are increasing requirements and industry standards from external partners to confirm that the University requires annual awareness training. 
Throughout the spring semester, we will do a soft launch of the program and training will be optional. I encourage everyone to take one or more of the trainings over the next few months. The information presented benefits individuals inside and outside of work. We welcome all feedback related to improving the experience. Provide feedback to securitytraining@uillinois.edu.Sincerely,Joe BarnesChief Privacy & Security Officer"

        Dear Students and Employees,
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act requires the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:
http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/
The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.
Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to marijuana in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s marijuana prohibition.
The university’s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.
The university’s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.
Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. University employees should contact Illinois Human Resources at (217) 333-2137.

        Dear students, faculty and staff:
It is a pleasure for me to join your chancellors in welcoming you back for the spring semester, and I hope you are as filled with hope as I am about what the coming months promise.
Every one of you has so much to be proud of for getting us here – to a point where it finally seems possible to begin putting the pandemic in the rear view and moving back toward the lives we now cherish more than ever. You have sacrificed and adapted – teaching and learning in hybrid ways, working remotely, and adopting new behaviors such as saliva testing, wearing masks and social distancing. You have come together to safeguard our universities and surrounding communities, making the University of Illinois System a model for the nation.
As vaccinations roll out to curb the virus, we can be grateful to our scientists and healthcare professionals who helped develop these innovative medicines. Yet I believe more work lies ahead, beyond conquering the deadliest pandemic in a century. Momentum must continue to bridge our nation’s lingering racial divide, as well as the economic gap between the haves and have nots. We must also work together to mend our divisions, to preserve debate while reducing hate and rancor, and to find solutions that protect our environment and our standing as a welcoming nation that America has carried since its birth.
Across all of those fronts, the U of I System will again lead the way, just as we have throughout the COVID-19 crisis. We have already set the pace through our Guiding Principles, first adopted in 2018 and expanded a year later. They stake our position on several crucial issues, from free speech and civic engagement to sustainability and immigration, reflecting the core values that define us and the ideals that we hold most dear. Please take another look at our Guiding Principles.
I hope you are as proud as I am to be part of an institution that is truly ahead of the game, an institution with its bearings in place, an institution committed to excellence and integrity in everything we do, an institution that is focused squarely on education and discovery that lifts the lives of all of our students and directly supports the public good.
I wish you all the very best in the semester to come, and my deepest thanks again for your hard work and cooperation during one of the most challenging periods in our more than 150-year history. And please keep up your COVID protocols as the finish line draws nearer. We have achieved far too much together to let our guard down now.
Sincerely,Tim"

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
Welcome back to this first week of the spring semester. This comes after the delayed return we implemented to allow our students time to complete two negative tests before beginning class. As you also know, concerns about a new spike in infections, especially with the arrival of more contagious COVID-19 variants led to my request that members of the campus community limit themselves to essential activities. 
I know this is a difficult request for all of us. But I write to implore all of our students, staff and faculty to adhere to this request. I also want to reiterate that all of our COVID-19 policies and operational rules are still being actively enforced. We will continue to exercise disciplinary action against those who do not comply with our COVID-19 requirements – including testing, social distancing and limitations on gathering sizes. And as we announced last week, students who are out of compliance may also lose access to university Wi-Fi, Zoom, Compass and other technologies. 
We will take enforcement seriously. But the honest truth is that the safety and health of this community depends on the decisions each of us makes on a daily basis. When we choose to wear masks, even when we’re not in a campus facility. When we follow our required weekly COVID testing schedule. When we decide to stay home rather than attend a party or stand in a crowded line – even though we just want to pretend the world is “normal” again, even if it’s just for an hour or two.
These decisions are hard. They are wearing us all down. And like many of you reading this, I too find myself besieged and beset by COVID-fatigue. But these good decisions and these difficult choices really can lead to truly life-changing outcomes.
Last week, I joined other community leaders in dedicating a memorial to those in Champaign County who have died from COVID-19. The “Open Hearts” memorial is easily seen from Green Street on the grounds of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Champaign-Urbana. On the day of event, it consisted of a field of more than 100 markers that each represented a life lost. In just a single week, at least three more markers must be added to this sad testament of the losses just in our own local community.
COVID-19 is not merely a nuisance or an inconvenience. These dashboards with those numbers to which we have grown so hardened are not statistics to be debated and analyzed.
These are human lives. Every infection. Every hospitalization. Every death.
Each of those markers along Green Street represents a parent, a grandparent, a sibling, a child, a friend, a neighbor, a former teacher, a coworker – someone who is being mourned. For those of us, including myself, who have lost family members in the pandemic, we see the faces and hear the voices of those we knew and loved in those markers. This is a singular sadness I would spare anyone if it was in my power.   
For nearly a year, this entire community has come together in virtually every conceivable way to fight this pandemic and to do all we can to look out for one another. 
I ask that you please, please continue to do so now as we enter this very dangerous period of the pandemic.
Vaccinations are a welcome light at the end of a tunnel. But that tunnel is still very long and dark. Until we reach its end, masks, social distancing and constant vigilance are going to be needed. It is up to all of us to do whatever is necessary so that we do not have to add more markers to that memorial that is located right in the heart of this university all of us have worked so hard to preserve in this enormously hard year.
Thank you for your commitment to one another and for your willingness to hold on for just a little while longer.
We have come this far together. Please do not let up now when we finally have an end in sight.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Campus Community Members, 
Last week you received a message about changes to the Zoom login process for Spring 2021. As of Tuesday, January 19, 2021, all University of Illinois users should log in to their University of Illinois Zoom account using your university NetID and password through Single Sign-On (SSO) to access University of Illinois Zoom meetings and event. All non-University of Illinois users will need to be signed into Zoom through a free Zoom account to access a University of Illinois Zoom event.   
What changed on January 19? To reduce the possibility of Zoombombings the Only Authenticated Users Can Join function in Zoom will be turned on by default for all meetings and webinars created after 7 am on Tuesday, January 19.  Turning this setting on will ONLY prevent anonymous access to meetings. The setting will not limit attendees to Illinois users. Anyone with a Zoom account (either a free account or an account through another university) will be permitted to connect after they sign in to Zoom.  
Specific details about how to sign in to Zoom are included in the original message to the campus community and you can find step-by-step instructions on the page Zoom, Logging In. 
How can speakers and guests from outside of the university join an Illinois Zoom event? Non-University of Illinois users, including invited speakers and members of the general public, will need to sign in to Zoom using their free Zoom account. Members of the general public can sign up for an account at https://zoom.us/signup. If a non-University of Illinois participant clicks on a Zoom meeting link without the client installed, the participant will be prompted to install the Zoom client. They can then install it or choose “cancel” and they can join the meeting with a web browser. 
We recommend that you include instructions about university Zoom meeting and webinar requirements in your event information to outside participants and provide directions suggesting that they sign up for a free Zoom account before the event. 
What happens if an attendee does not sign in to Zoom?For meetings and webinars created after 7 am on January 19th, if an attendee tries to join before signing in to Zoom, they may receive a message: “This Meeting is for Authorized Users Only.” To correct this problem, external participants should log in via their institutional or personal Zoom accounts. University of Illinois users should check that they have signed in through SSO, follow the steps on the page Zoom: Safe, Inclusive and Accessible Space for ALL, then open the meeting again. 
Please note: When creating the Zoom meeting or webinar, event planners will have the option to turn off the Only Authenticated Users Can Join setting manually. In certain circumstances, including events with robust pre-registration processes and Zoom Webinar events, turning this function off may make managing the event easier. However, turning this setting off may open the event up to the potential of Zoombombing and other unwanted disruptions and is not recommended. 
Are there additional ways that I can protect my event from Zoombombing?  To create events that are both easy to manage and reduce the risk of Zoombombing, we recommend the use of the registration function with manual approvals for attendees in Zoom. For detailed instructions on how to set up your event, please see Zoom, Planning your event.  
We strongly discourage the sharing of Zoom meeting IDs and passwords on flyers, social media, public calendars, and websites. Publicly sharing meeting ids and passwords is an open invitation to intrusions.  
What should I do if I have more questions or concerns?If you have problems signing in to Zoom, please contact Technology Services Help Desk at consult@illinois.edu or call (217) 244-7000. 
If a Zoombombing does occur during a class or event that you host, please report the incident to the Office for Access & Equity or the Bias Assessment and Response Team. Zoombombing attacks violate the values of the University of Illinois, and no member of our community or event attendee should experience the disrespectful intrusions and harms that these attacks can cause. 
Thank you for your help in creating a safe and inclusive learning environment for all members of the University of Illinois community. These steps will help you to create a safe virtual meeting environment for your students and event participants.

                January 20, 2021 1:17 PM
			
        Dear students,
As many of you return to campus to prepare for the Spring 2021 semester, I want to share some important safety information. Our Shield team predicts an increase in COVID-19 cases as we repopulate the campus. We also expect to see the highly contagious B117 variant enter our community. This variant of the virus appears to spread 50 percent faster than any other strains. It has already caused the UK to go into lockdown and has already been detected in our state. In the next several weeks it is absolutely critical that we work together to maximize the safety of our entire community.
After a spike of positive cases early in the Fall 2020 semester, we all worked together to flatten the curve and prevent any more spikes the rest of the semester. We were also encouraged that there was no evidence of COVID-19 spread in the classroom and no evidence of COVID-19 spread from the campus to the larger community. We want these facts to be true again this semester, but we need your help.   
And I need to be very clear that students who do not follow all COVID-related expectations face university disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. Please note that this semester, students who are out of compliance may also lose access to university Wi-Fi, Zoom, Compass and other technologies. 
Participate in Essential Activities Only Until Feb. 8 For the first several weeks, students should limit their in-person interactions to only the most essential activities: taking COVID-19 tests, attending class, purchasing groceries and food, going to work, engaging in individual outdoor activity, attending religious services and seeking medical attention. This also means that once you arrive on campus for the semester, you should avoid travel outside the Champaign-Urbana area. The target date for lifting essential activities only is Monday, Feb. 8 but it could be sooner or later depending on what the data show about virus spread. I will communicate any updates.
Participate in Return TestingAll students must receive two negative on-campus test results, no closer than three days apart, between Jan. 15-24. Students should get their first on-campus COVID-19 test as soon as possible when they return to campus and remain in the local community. Students will have “Access Denied” status in the Safer Illinois app and Boarding Pass until they receive their second negative test result. After receiving two negative test results, students should continue their twice-per-week on-campus COVID-19 testing schedules. See more information here.
Continue other COVID-19 Safety MeasuresWe will continue to require everyone to practice social distancing on campus and to wear face coverings in university facilities unless alone in a private space. Face coverings are also required for outdoor campus spaces where sufficient social distancing is not possible. Students are also required to comply with quarantine and isolation guidelines from the university and Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. All students who did not finish the COVID-19 online training previously for the Fall 2020 semester are required to complete it before the start of the Spring 2021 semester which begins Monday, Jan. 25.
I know the fall semester was not easy, and we all have COVID-19 fatigue. But I want you to know I am extremely proud of each of you and of the COVID-19 ecosystem we have been able to build together at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign to contain virus spread and continue delivering on our missions.
It's so important that we all continue to follow these procotols, while we work with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) to offer vaccines to students, faculty and staff in our community. We will share more updates on vaccines with you throughout the semester because we know getting our community vaccinated is a critical step in ending this pandemic. 
I am happy to report that we are actively planning new ways to support your wellness and mental health during this time. And we are also working on ways to provide students with more interaction and engagement. We want you to have more freedom and an even better university experience this semester. To do those things, it is essential that we make it through these first few weeks of the semester by being relentless in protecting ourselves and each other.
Thank you for your understanding, patience and persistence. I am so proud to be your chancellor.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        All Undergraduate and Graduate Students: ­­­­
All students living on-campus or residing in Champaign, Urbana, or Savoy are required to test even if they are taking a fully online schedule. In addition, the university’s COVID-19 testing policy requires all students working on-campus, attending in-person classes, or participating in any on-campus activities to participate in the on-campus testing program.
The university has developed a process for students who are living locally (Urbana, Champaign, and Savoy) and who are not coming to campus during the spring 2021 semester to apply for an exemption from the COVID-19 testing requirement. Exemptions will be granted rarely and only to students who can demonstrate that participating in the testing program is especially burdensome to them.
Effective Friday, January 15, students who wish to apply for an exemption should submit their information at go.illinois.edu/CovidExemption.
Only students who are living locally and NOT coming to campus are eligible to request an exemption.
Students who were granted an exemption from testing in the fall 2020 semester will need to reapply for a spring 2021 exemption at go.illinois.edu/CovidExemption.

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,  
Throughout the transition to virtual meeting platforms, the University of Illinois has worked to reduce Zoombombings by intruders whose sole purpose has been to disrupt an online meeting with often racist, threatening, or violent images and views. However, at universities across the country including Illinois, Zoombombings continue to occur. 
To create safe, inclusive, and accessible online spaces for teaching and learning and further secure Zoom meetings, as of Tuesday, January 19, 2021, all University of Illinois users will be required to log in to their University of Illinois Zoom account using their university NetID and password to access University of Illinois Zoom meetings and events.  
We strongly recommend that you log in early to your first Zoom class or meeting on or after January 19 to ensure that you are properly signed in to your University of Illinois Zoom account.  
After opening the Zoom desktop or mobile application, follow the steps below: 
Click “Sign In” 
Then, click “Sign In with SSO” 
Type “Illinois” and click “Continue” 
Log in with your university NetID and password, and respond to the 2FA prompt. 
All University of Illinois users should click the Sign in with SSO (Single Sign-On) button first in order to log on to your University of Illinois Zoom account. Single Sign-On is the gateway to University of Illinois resources using your NetID and university password. Please review this article for step-by-step instructions: Zoom, Logging In. 
If you try to join a meeting before you have signed in with SSO, you may receive a message that says: “This Meeting is for Authorized Users Only.” To correct this problem, check that you have signed in through Single-Sign On, follow the steps on the page Zoom: Safe, Inclusive and Accessible Space for ALL, then open the meeting again. 
If you continue to have problems, please contact Technology Services Help Desk at consult@illinois.edu or call (217) 244-7000.  
Zoombombing attacks violate the mission and values of the University of Illinois, and no member of our community should need to experience the disrespectful intrusion and harm that these attacks can cause. If a Zoombombing does occur in a virtual class or meeting, please report the incident to the Office for Access & Equity or the Bias Assessment and Response Team. This change to a more secure login process for the University of Illinois community will allow us to continue to create the safe experience that our community deserves and expects while we teach, learn and work in virtual spaces during the Spring semester.

                January 12, 2021 2:47 PM
			
        Dear Members of the Campus Community,
The annual celebration of the life and legacy of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. every January is a reminder of the fervent belief in a dream that who we can and should be as a nation depends upon recognizing the full humanity of each person, a dream rooted in honest examination of history and the work for racial justice when inequity exists.
It is our community’s commitment to the dream of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. that we will celebrate this month with a series of events, beginning with the MLK Advocacy for Justice Virtual Celebration on Sunday, January 17 at 3 pm Central.
This year's keynote speaker will be the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II, one of the leading voices for equality and social justice in our nation today, who will speak live from North Carolina.
More information about this virtual event is at go.illinois.edu/MLK2021. A link to watch the Sunday, January 17 celebration will be posted on this page and is open to the public.
The Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II is the President & Senior Lecturer of Repairers of the Breach and Co-Chair of the Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call For Moral Revival. Rev. Dr. Barber is also the architect of the Moral Movement, which began with weekly Moral Monday protests at the North Carolina General Assembly in 2013 and recently relaunched again online in August 2020 under the banner of the Poor People's Campaign, which was begun by Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968.
This year’s University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign celebration will also feature nearly three weeks of presentations, activities, and discussions reflecting on what it means to speak from a position of conscience. Due to current COVID-19 social distancing requirements, this year’s events will be virtual and open to all through online platforms. A full calendar of events is available online. Pre-registration may be required to receive links to some events.
During a year defined by COVID-19, the pandemic has directed a new light on the persistent and insidious twin crisis of systemic racism and generationally embedded racial disparities afflicting our society. This year’s celebration of the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. is a common and shared call to action for everyone in the community to commit to the hard work necessary to end racism and social injustice.
I hope that you will be able to join me in attending some of these events.
Sincerely,
Sean C. GarrickVice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion"

I hope you had a restful Winter Break after a challenging fall semester. I am so grateful to you for taking actions to protect our entire university community in the fall. Even with the promise of vaccinations, this is a critically important time to be vigilant about our COVID-19 guidelines. Below is a summary of information you will need to know in the coming weeks to maximize safety for everyone in the Spring 2021 semester. Here is the message we sent to all students with additional specific information.
COVID-19 TestingFaculty and staff who participate in any on-campus activities are required to continue their twice-per-week on-campus COVID-19 testing schedules. We are also encouraging all faculty and staff who travel away from campus to test immediately upon return and limit your activities to essential, such as attending work, testing, visiting the pharmacy and buying groceries, until you receive two negative on-campus test results if you are able to do so. See the current list of on-campus COVID-19 testing site locations here.
COVID-19 VaccinationsThe Illinois Department of Public Health is coordinating with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) to distribute COVID-19 vaccines for our community. More information about COVID-19 vaccinations can be found here.
Building AccessAs in the fall semester, Wellness Support Associates (WSA) may be stationed inside entrances to facilities where in-person classes are being held. At each WSA-staffed entrance, any individual (faculty, staff or student) who wishes to enter must show the WSA their building entry status with the Safer Illinois app or the Boarding Pass. More information about building access can be found here.
Quarantine & IsolationEmployees are required to comply with quarantine and isolation guidelines from the university and Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. Failure to follow these guidelines can result in disciplinary action. More information about quarantine and isolation can be found here.
Online COVID-19 TrainingAll faculty and staff who did not finish the COVID-19 online training previously are required to complete it before Monday, Jan. 25. I encourage everyone else to consider taking it again as a reminder.
Face Coverings & Social DistancingWe will continue to require everyone to practice social distancing on campus and to wear face coverings in university facilities unless they are alone in a private space. Face coverings are also required for outdoor campus spaces where sufficient social distancing is not possible.
I sincerely appreciate your understanding as we continue to make decisions and take actions to maximize the safety of our students, faculty, staff and greater community.

Even with the promise of vaccinations, this is a critically important time to be vigilant about our COVID-19 guidelines. Below is a summary of information you will need to know in the coming weeks to maximize safety for everyone in the Spring 2021 semester.
COVID-19 Return Testing
All undergraduate and graduate students who are required to participate in the on-campus COVID-19 testing program will be required to receive two negative on-campus test results between Jan. 15-24, no sooner than three days apart. Students should begin testing as soon as they return to campus or in the community and participate only in essential activities, such as working and buying groceries, until they receive two negative on-campus test results.
Students are to follow these testing schedules upon returning to campus if they are able to do so:
Graduate students should test Jan. 15 & 19.
Seniors should test Jan. 15 & 19. (Seniors who live in University Housing should test Jan. 17 & 21.)
Juniors should test Jan. 16 & 20. (Juniors who live in University Housing should test Jan. 17 & 21.)
Sophomores should test Jan. 17 & 21.
Freshmen and new students should test Jan. 17 or 18 (their first day on campus or in the community) & 22.
Your building access status in the Safer Illinois app and the Boarding Pass will be set to “access denied” until you receive two negative on-campus test results, no closer than three days apart. To ensure building access by the first day of instruction, your second test should be on or before Jan. 22. Students who require access to buildings before they are able to receive two negative tests should coordinate a plan with their supervisors.
After receiving two negative tests, students should continue their twice-per-week on-campus COVID-19 testing schedules. See the current list of on-campus COVID-19 testing site locations here.
Please note students enrolled in fully online degree programs (see here for a listing of these programs) are not expected to participate in the on campus COVID-19 testing program.
COVID-19 VaccinationsThe Illinois Department of Public Health is coordinating with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) to distribute COVID-19 vaccines for our community. More information about COVID-19 vaccinations can be found here.

More information about building access can be found here.
Positive Off-Campus COVID-19 ResultsUndergraduate and graduate students who test positive for COVID-19 at an off-campus location should submit their positive off-campus COVID-19 test result through the MyMcKinley Portal. Students who tested positive during the break should upload their results before Monday, Jan. 25, the first day of instruction.
Quarantine & IsolationStudents are required to comply with quarantine and isolation guidelines from the university and Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. More information about quarantine and isolation can be found here.
Online COVID-19 TrainingAll students who did not finish the COVID-19 online training previously for the Fall 2020 semester are required to complete it before the start of the Spring 2021 semester on Monday, Jan. 25. I encourage everyone else to consider taking it again as a reminder.

Face coverings are also required for outdoor campus spaces where sufficient social distancing is not possible.
Spring 2021 ResidenceAll students are required to provide the address for where they are living during the Spring 2021 semester. You will receive an email from the Office of the Registrar this week with instructions for submitting your address.
Students who do not follow all COVID-related expectations face university disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.

        Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,
Yesterday’s riot and the assault on the physical and symbolic center of our democratic nation were a disconcerting and chaotic beginning to the new year. We are all shaken and appalled by this attack on our sacred values and freedoms.
Freedom of expression and speech are bedrock principles of our democratic society and our university. Vigorous and even heated political debate is a welcome and necessary part of a democracy. Yesterday’s violence, threats, and carnage, however, are antithetical to the values, rights and protections established and guaranteed by our Constitution, undermine every aspect of our society and do irreparable damage to the community in which we all live and work and our stature in the world.
At the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, we will always encourage our students, faculty and staff to exercise the rights and freedoms that our nation’s Constitution protects. We expect all members of our community to exercise those freedoms with thoughtfulness, responsibility and respect for one another. Together, we can demonstrate to the nation and to the world how to express ourselves, even when we disagree, in a way that recognizes and celebrates the fundamental nature of democratic discourse.

        Dear campus community member,
The Urbana campus will test its emergency notification system at 10:05 a.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 5.
All campus community members are encouraged to sign up for Illini-Alert text messages to receive prompt notification of campus emergencies. You can do so by visiting http://emergency.illinois.edu. Contact information for friends and relatives may be added at http://go.illinois.edu/illinialertmyfamily. Anyone else can sign up by texting ""IlliniAlert"" to 226787.
The test of the Illini-Alert system will use all of the communication capabilities of the emergency notification system:
Email messages will be sent to all active faculty and staff members and students with campus email addresses.
Text messages will be sent to those people who have registered their cellphone numbers.  
The Emergency Web Alert System will trigger a pop-up box on all campus websites.
A message will appear on the Illini-Alert Facebook account (http://www.facebook.com/illinialert).
A message will be sent to the Illini-Alert Twitter account (http://twitter.com/illinialert).

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
As you have likely heard, the first COVID-19 vaccine shipment has arrived in our community. The Illinois Department of Public Health is coordinating with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) to distribute the vaccines. CUPHD has told us that the university will likely receive its first allotment within the coming week. For more information, visit the CUPHD vaccination website here.   
Following guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we have plans in place for how the vaccines allotted to our campus will be offered and who will receive them first. Based on the CDC guidelines, our first community members to receive them will be healthcare workers. The university will then work through subsequent groups based on priority criteria.
CUPHD does not anticipate the vaccine being widely available until spring. If you are an employee, your unit will be contacted when you are eligible to receive a vaccine. Your unit will then communicate with you directly. If you are a student, you will be contacted by McKinley Health Center when you are eligible to receive a vaccine. Until then, please be patient while we work with CUPHD to offer the vaccine to as many people in our university community as we are able.
As we learn more information about COVID-19 federal, state and county vaccine plans, we will update the campus community as soon as we are able. Please continue to check the university COVID-19 vaccination page for the most updated information.
The distribution of a vaccine is welcome news, but we must still continue to be diligent as ever in safety precautions during the upcoming holiday season, including regular COVID-19 testing. Thank you in advance for your understanding and patience as we work through this next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                December 15, 2020 9:17 AM
			
        Dear Students, Staff and Faculty, 
This week,  the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign processed the one-millionth iteration of our unique saliva-based COVID-19 test since launching the program in July. You can read some more detailed reflections on that milestone and the path that led us to it here.
But with this message, we hope to remind you of the magnitude of what you have done together this semester and to simply say thank you.
This milestone is far more than an accumulation of lab results.
Every one of those million tests was a personal decision to protect friends, coworkers and complete strangers.
This is a celebration of one million times that those of you who chose to work or study in-person in this community also chose to put the safety and well-being of those around you first.
It is an irrefutable, loud and public demonstration of the commitment of our students, faculty and staff to make the very hard choices this pandemic has required of you time and time again.
It hasn’t always been smooth. We’ve had to constantly learn and adjust. But we ended the semester successfully. We saw no COVID-related hospitalizations among our students, faculty or staff, and no evidence of spread in classrooms – or to our employees from our students. Local hospitals and medical providers braced for a swell of COVID-19 cases among our students, but that didn’t happen.
Every member of our faculty and staff has been asked to rethink, realign and reimagine their roles and responsibilities to help us find ways to support our students and to keep our university moving forward when it matters the most. Thank you for demonstrating the power of our determination and commitment here at Illinois to find important and unexpected solutions on an unimaginable timeline.
Our SHIELD Team invented a new test, created a digital app and implemented a sophisticated modeling and analytics effort to guide and support it. Our testing site staff and Veterinary Diagnostic Lab staff worked seven days a week around the clock to deliver it to us all. Our Building Service Workers, Dining Service Workers and Housing staff worked even throughout the state’s stay-at-home order to continue delivering essential services and support to students, faculty and fellow staff members. Our counseling and health center professionals have had to reinvent their work and services. Our human resources and technology services operations have been asked to develop entirely new frameworks for support and services that did not exist. Faculty and instructors redesigned and adapted their courses.
We also want to express our profound gratitude for the leadership, collaboration and determination we have seen in action across Champaign County since last January, even before the COVID crisis had really reached us. From the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District to the mayors of Champaign, Urbana and Savoy to our county officials to our local business owners – we have worked together as partners in name and in true practice every step of the way. And that is why Champaign County is a national model for how truly engaged universities and communities strengthen each other – especially in difficult times. We are hopeful that the new year will bring us the ability to expand our own testing process to more members of our local community.
But, by far, the biggest debt of gratitude for the success of this semester is owed to our students. To you, our students, we acknowledge that this is not the college experience you wanted nor the one you deserve. You have worn your masks, maintained social distancing from friends, scheduled your days around testing site hours and given up so many of the social experiences you should have had to look after the safety and well-being of others. Our ability to come together and stay together this semester is thanks to your good choices and your perseverance. We are so very proud of your accomplishments. 
We know how hard this year has been. Many of our Illinois family who were not able to be here in-person this semester had to navigate remote experiences that brought a new collection of challenges. We miss them, and we thank them for their strength and patience. All of us have struggled with the isolation, the lack of easy human interaction, the pandemic fatigue. And many of us are grieving family and loved ones lost to the pandemic.
Thankfully, with a number of vaccines on the way, there is a hopeful light beginning to shine in this very long, dark tunnel in which we have traveled together. Still, we have some distance to go and we must continue to be vigilant and careful to make the hard choices that have helped all of us get so much further this semester at Illinois than many ever believed would be possible.
Wherever you are today, we wish you well in this last week of the semester and we hope you all have a safe winter break filled with family, friends, hope and well-earned rest.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

        Dear students,
For those of you who returned to the local community to finish the semester, we hope you have found the additional study spaces we have opened to be helpful. You can find the full list of spaces with the days and times they are open here.
If you utilize these spaces, we do want to remind you that all of our current campus COVID-19 guidelines and rules must be followed at all times.
Building access status will be verified via the Safer Illinois App or a COVID-19 Boarding Pass.
Social distancing and face coverings are required.
You must adhere to the posted room capacity.
Please clean your seat and work space with the supplies provided when you leave.
Furniture cannot be moved within the room or to any other location.
Please be courteous and respectful to others using the rooms.
You must exit the building by the posted closing time or you will be considered to be trespassing.
We know this has been a semester unlike any other and we have depended on you to take care of one another and to adjust your experiences to address the restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic.
We have just a few more days to go together before you have a well-earned and deserved break.
We hope these additional safe, quiet study spaces are helpful in this last week. Please use them. And please, just as you have done all semester, use them in ways that keep your classmates, faculty and staff as safe as possible.

                December 9, 2020 1:32 PM
			
        Dear UIUC Student Body,
Thank you for pushing through this semester through all the stress, anxiety, and new challenges. You have made this community better by exhibiting your resilience and strength through adjusting to a new online format during a global pandemic.
I know you are tired, and that is okay. It’s normal to be worn out, drained, and lack motivation. As a student myself I face the struggles that all of you face each day. We never thought we would live through something like this. It has been the most challenging semester for our university and students, but you’re almost there. You did it, you are almost on the last lap of the semester. You can and will do it. While we move forward into the final weeks, I want to shed light amidst a sea of darkness and highlight what ISG has accomplished this semester. ISG is the official system of student governance at UIUC. We are the official representative body of all students, and our mission is to create a safe and welcoming campus, advocate for necessary changes, and maintain a high quality of life and education for students. We serve the student body in a time when advocacy is needed more than ever. We have worked tirelessly since the summer to be the voice of the students, and we want to share some of our accomplishments from the semester:
Police Reform
The Executive Branch has worked on police reform by having monthly meetings with Chief of Police Cary. These meetings allowed Vice-President Ackerman-Avilla and me to change official police standard operating guidelines which prevents police officers from entering classrooms unless they meet specific requirements
Academic Support for Students
Towards the end of the semester the Executive Branch and the Senate worked together to pass CR/NC through the UC Senate
The Executive Branch spoke with Provost Cangellaris, Chancellor Jones, and Vice Chancellor Young about the importance of supporting students through this difficult time by implementing CR/NC
Our efforts were heavily supported by students who shared their stories at UC Senate, pushing them to vote in favor of CR/NC
New Mascot Efforts
Through the whole semester, the Kingfisher Taskforce pushed for the adoption of the Belted Kingfisher to serve as the new University mascot. The committee has set a strong foundation by getting alumni support, speaking with outside organizations, growing the social media presence of the Kingfisher, and more. We welcome the recent Massmail announcing a series of steps in the right direction, but soon it will be time for the administration to take serious action by adopting the Belted Kingfisher as the official University mascot
Social Justice
ISG collaborated with Illinois-Coalition Assisting Undocumented Students’ Education to host a teach-in to shed light on the ways that anti-immigration policies impact the lives of those who pursue higher education daily.
In the fall, we partnered with Students for Environmental Concerns to host a teach-in about the importance of environmental justice and divesting from fossil fuels
ISG partnered with Students for Justice in Palestine and Black Students for Revolution to discuss the University investing in ethical companies
We have had several meetings with different administrators to increase funding for cultural houses, specifically, creating a Middle Eastern Northern African Cultural House, and provide better support to students of color on campus
Election Efforts
ISG partnered with the Student Illinois PIRG, Illini Union Board and Reaching Across Classes to host a fun voting trivia night to teach students about the different aspects of voting
Close to election week we hosted a March to the Polls where RSOs canvassed campus to increase voter turnout by reminding students to vote
ISG held a Political Dialogue series which included Illini Democrats, Illini Republicans, Illini Libertarians, and Young Democratic Socialists of America
Membership
Amazingly, diversity within ISG is at an all-time-high. Members come from all walks of life, which better assists the overall mission of ISG
Despite COVID-19 limiting what we are able to do, ISG has had a very high application rate with many competitive applicants applying to be part of ISG
Once again, I would truly like to reiterate my thankfulness for your ability to stay strong this semester despite the difficulties that we as a community have faced. It has been difficult, but luckily the semester is coming to an end and soon break will be approaching. Thank you for showing the country how strong our students and community are. You are all integral to the success of our University.
Sincerely,
Alexis PerezchicaStudent Body President"

        Dear undergraduate and graduate students,
We know many of you plan to be away from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign community during Winter Break. Because of this, there is a chance that you may test positive for COVID-19 at an off-campus location. If this happens, we request that you submit your positive off-campus COVID-19 test result through the MyMcKinley Portal.
How to submit your positive off-campus COVID-19 test result
Log into the MyMcKinley Portal.
Click on the “Upload” button on the right side of the menu header.
Choose “COVID-19 Outside Results/Notifications – Urbana-Champaign Campus Only” from the drop-down menu.
Upload your positive COVID-19 test result file.
Important notes
The university needs your positive off-campus results to speed the processing of any repeat positives once you return to campus.
The university needs your positive off-campus results to evaluate your testing requirements if you live in a location that is asked to test every other day. (Currently, individuals who have already tested positive and been released from isolation are not required to increase their testing requirements.)
We only want your positive off-campus test results. Please do not submit any negative results. Negative off-campus results do not replace any mandatory on-campus testing requirements for those who are in the Champaign-Urbana-Savoy area.
Please submit your results well ahead of the beginning of the Spring 2021 semester to ensure a smooth transition.
Thank you so much for all of your efforts to maximize our safety this semester. We hope once this semester is finished, you are able to enjoy a well-deserved break before restarting your classes, research or work.

                December 4, 2020 2:03 PM
			
        Dear faculty, staff and students,
We want you to be aware of a small change we are making to the on-campus COVID-19 saliva testing process. Currently, individuals are asked to provide a saliva sample into a large test tube. Beginning this week, individuals will be asked to use a straw to provide a saliva sample into a smaller test tube instead. The shift in process will provide benefits to our on-campus testing process, including:
A more efficient, automated process
Faster lab processing of test results
Fewer invalid/inconclusive results
Reduced plastic waste
On Monday, the CRCE COVID-19 testing site will begin using the new tubes. On Tuesday, the Veterinary Medicine COVID-19 testing site will begin using the new tubes. The university is planning to gradually transition all of the on-campus testing sites to the new tube size. Employees at the testing sites will explain how to use the straw and the smaller tube. The rest of the on-campus testing process will remain the same.
Please be sure to follow all of the regular recommendations for on-campus saliva testing. Please do not eat, drink, brush your teeth, use mouthwash or use tobacco product at least one hour prior to submitting your sample. Also, please make sure the sample you submit is saliva only. Thanks again for your participation and support of our SHIELD testing program.

                December 4, 2020 10:01 AM

        Dear Campus Community,
In Spring 2018, our campus invited over 600 students, staff, faculty, alumni and community members to engage in a conversation about the campus’s relationship to the Chief Illiniwek tradition. This “Chancellor’s Critical Conversations on Native Imagery” created space for everyone to come together and discuss what moving forward would mean to them. In Fall 2018, I designated a Commission on Native Imagery which delivered a thoughtful report citing areas of focus and next steps, focused on healing and reconciliation, establishing new traditions and strengthening relationships with Native Nations.
This past year, I charged working groups to take the Commission’s observations and develop an implementation plan. Today, I am pleased to announce the release of this implementation plan, along with the next steps our campus will be taking over the next three years. One of the most important aspects of the report is the centering of our responsibility to the Native Nations for whom the lands that now comprise the state of Illinois are home. Developing reciprocal, mutual relationships with these Native Nations is integral to our responsibility as an institution.
Some of the highlights of the Implementation Plan include:
In-State Tuition for Native Students: Starting Fall 2020, students who are enrolled as citizens of a federally recognized Tribal Nation can attend the university at the same rate as in-state students.
Relationships with Native Nations: The university will strengthen its partnership with the Peoria Tribe of Oklahoma, while also developing new relationships with other Native Nations who called Illinois home.
Permanent On-Campus Sites: The university will explore permanent structures that would acknowledge and represent Peoria and other Native Nations.
Repatriation of University’s Native American Collections to Tribal Communities and Lineal Descendants: The University’s Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation has begun coordinating activities in keeping with the requirements of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) to assist with repatriation of Native people’s remains, cultural items and sacred objects, which has included hiring the university’s first NAGPRA Program Officer.
Historic Account of Native Imagery: A campus historian is currently working on developing an accurate and thorough history of the campus’s use of Native symbols and imagery.
Indigenous Faculty Increase: In partnership with the American Indian Studies program, this report recommends hiring a cohort of faculty for this program, as well as hiring a tribal liaison, who will act as a conduit to Native American organizations and tribes.
New Traditions: The Illinois Spirit & Traditions Council, a new student council co-led by Student Affairs, the Division of Intercollegiate Athletics and the Alumni Association, will begin working to develop new traditions with members of the student body.
These working groups will be responsible for putting the observations from the Implementation Plan into action. Although these will not happen overnight, we have set a quick timeline to begin this work. My website will have updates on the progress of this work, as well as the full report.
It is time to implement a plan to create new traditions that reflect and include all members of our 21st century university community. The implementation plan provides a bridge from the past to the present—to fully remember the complex intent of the tradition while also accepting responsibility for its painful impact—and a vision for the future.

                December 3, 2020 2:24 PM
			
        Dear Colleagues,
I’m writing to announce a new Staff Voluntary Retirement Plan for Academic Professional and Civil Service employees who meet retirement eligibility by May 31, 2021. The goal of the plan is to provide an incentive opportunity and support our employees who may want to retire. Offering this plan will also help the university to navigate budget challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The application window for the plan will open today and will close Friday, Jan. 15, 2021. Eligible employees who wish to voluntarily retire and are accepted under the plan would receive a lump sum payment equal to 20 weeks of their current annual salary, up to a maximum payment of $75,000, less required deductions. For employees in union-represented bargaining units, eligibility shall be addressed through the required collective bargaining process.
Applications will be reviewed by units and Illinois Human Resources, and applicants will be officially notified of a decision in February 2021. For more information on the eligibility criteria, visit this Illinois Human Resources webpage. All eligible employees can expect to hear more details directly from Illinois Human Resources. There will also be a Staff Voluntary Retirement Plan informational session on Tuesday, Dec. 8 at noon. At that time, you can watch the livestream session here.
Please note the following staff members are not eligible for the plan:
Faculty
Staff members in positions funded 50% or greater by grant funds
Staff members in Illinois Fire Service Institute (due to special state appropriation)
Staff members in the Division of Intercollegiate Athletics
Staff members currently on notice of non-reappointment (NONR), unless the NONR is due to reclassification from academic professional to civil service
Employees currently in inactive status
System Offices employees
The plan is a positive strategic initiative to support employees who have served the university faithfully, while also navigating our current and future budget projections. If the plan is relevant and interesting to you, I hope you will explore the opportunity.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                December 3, 2020 6:01 AM
			
        Dear campus community member,
In order to maintain an effective emergency response and evacuation plan, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign recently completed a test including two components: a drill and an exercise. The annual test is designed to challenge our emergency response procedures and how we notify you of a threat to our campus community.
We are notifying you of these efforts to keep you informed about how we intend to protect our students, faculty, staff and visitors in the event of an emergency, and to comply with disclosure requirements outlined in federal law. No additional action on your part is required in response to this message.
On October 14, university stakeholders and emergency responders gathered virtually for a tabletop exercise from 9-11 a.m. Those involved were presented with a fictional scenario involving a civil demonstration that escalated and disrupted campus operations. The exercise tested various components of the Campus Emergency Operations Plan, including evacuation procedures.
For the second component, we initiated a test of our Illini-Alert emergency notification system on December 1. The drill was announced ahead of time by a mass email to campus and an Eweek notification to faculty and staff. The Illini-Alert was sent by email to the campus email addresses of all active students, faculty and staff. Those who have registered alternate email addresses also received a notification. Those who have registered a cellphone number were sent a text message during this drill.
Illini-Alert messages are also posted to Facebook, Twitter, digital signage and on campus websites through our Emergency Web Alert System. This approach increases the speed and breadth of our distribution of emergency notifications, and it provides a communication mechanism that will continue to function successfully even if one component fails to work properly.
This test was conducted to ensure we have a robust response plan in the event of a campus emergency, and that our emergency notifications will reach you in a timely and effective manner. If you have not signed up to receive emergency messages through Illini-Alert, please visit emergency.illinois.edu to register.
To view the University’s emergency response and evacuation procedures, please visit go.illinois.edu/EmergencyResponse. 
The University of Illinois Police Department is committed to maintaining a safe and secure campus environment where education, research and public service can flourish. We can only do so with the assistance of our community, and we hope this information is useful to all of our campus partners.
 
Sincerely,
Sherry Wooten

                November 23, 2020 4:48 PM
			
        Dear university community,
In response to advice and input from our students, and approval by the Academic Senate, we are implementing the following academic policy modifications for the Fall 2020 semester. These changes acknowledge the unique and challenging pandemic-related circumstances and the additional stress it has caused for students.
Drop Deadline
The deadline to drop a course without a grade of W and, for undergraduates, to use the campus Grade Replacement Policy, has been extended to 11:59 p.m. CST on Dec. 18, 2020.
This deadline applies to full semester, second eight-week courses and non-standard courses with an end date after Dec. 1, 2020.
Students who want to drop a course that has an end date before Dec. 1, 2020 should contact their academic advisor or college advising office to discuss available options.
Most course drops can be performed through Self-Service until 11:59 p.m. CST on Dec. 18, 2020, unless the drop puts the student below full-time enrollment status. Dropped courses at this point in the semester will not result in any refunds.

Credit/No Credit
The deadline to elect the Credit/No Credit grade mode has been extended to 11:59 p.m. CST Jan. 5, 2021.
Please note the timeline to select Credit/No Credit grading will be different than it was in the Spring 2020 semester; the deadline is after final grades are available.
As we are still working through the implementation details, the time window for students to select Credit/No Credit will not open immediately. Rest assured that all students will have an adequate opportunity to make the CR/NC selection, and the window for selection will extend beyond the end of the semester.
Election of Credit/No Credit for courses this term will not count toward applicable minimums as outlined in the Student Code Section 3-105.
For courses in which Credit/No Credit is elected and Credit is earned (letter grades of C- and higher), the credit is applicable towards major, minor and general education requirements.
Credit/No Credit is not available to DVM, JD or MD students due to professional licensure requirements.

In making decisions about dropping courses or the CR/NC option, consultation with academic advisors, college offices and the Office of Financial Aid for students receiving aid is strongly encouraged. As is always the case, students facing exceptionally difficult or unexpected circumstances that may require other accommodations continue to have the option to seek assistance through their college office.
We understand that this initial communication does not address all details or questions about these modifications and the implications. Please know we are working on a more detailed document and FAQ, which will be available on the Office of the Provost’s policies website. We thank the Academic Senate for their important and timely role in implementing these policy modifications.

Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

Students who choose the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for their college education make that decision with an expectation that they will find the freedom and security to grow, to explore and to express their whole and best selves.
But, sadly, that is not the experience of all members of the student community. Anti-Semitic acts and expressions are all too common in our country and in our world, and examples of that intolerance have occurred at this university as well. This is unacceptable. While the university has taken measures in the past to address this problem, the university must do more.
Today, in collaboration with leaders in the Jewish community, we released a joint statement reaffirming our shared and common goal of creating a safe and welcoming environment for Jewish students and some actions that we will be taking towards that goal.

        Dear students, faculty and staff:
We are heading into the final weeks of a semester like none of us has ever experienced, one in which we have been tested in ways we could not have foreseen.
I write now with heartfelt gratitude for all the hard work you have done. You have faced this global crisis with innovation, adaptability and persistence.
And together, we have accomplished so much, building a bridge this fall toward the future we all want.
The saliva-based testing regimens and adherence to safety protocols have allowed tens of thousands of you to return to our three universities, to meet in our classrooms and labs, in person, taking part in the transformative experience that is a University of Illinois education.
As you walk across our campuses, you also see that face coverings and proper social distancing are widely in evidence.
Our rates of positive tests and numbers of cases have remained low. While state rates are now in double digits, our seven-day rate of positive tests stands at about 2.3 percent at the University of Illinois Chicago, 1.8 percent at the University of Illinois Springfield and still just 0.5 percent at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
Those numbers tell us our universities are among the safest places in the state, a model for how this can work.
Our protocols are also able to quickly identify and address potential problems. Our testing provided just such a signal this week at UIC and UIS, prompting a shift to virtual learning, albeit only briefly in Springfield, and for the remainder of the semester in Chicago, due to the sharp growth of cases in the city.
Throughout the fall, we have relied on a multidisciplinary approach to solve the myriad problems created by the pandemic. This has allowed us to address the medical demands while considering factors such as human behavior and risk-taking, and to explore the broad economic and social impacts of the virus.
Our universities have also found ways to nurture student life beyond the classroom: outdoor movie nights, virtual exercise classes and concerts.
Our approach to all of this has and will continue to evolve, just as our understanding of the virus constantly grows and changes.
We are again at an important juncture. With hope on the horizon in the form of our pioneering trials for vaccines and therapeutics to use against the coronavirus, we do not want to lose ground now.
Most immediately, we need everyone to follow the guidance coming from each of your universities – travel only if you must, continue to follow the testing program that remains foundational to your safety, cover your face and maintain social distance, work away from your campus if you can so that those who must be there can do so with less risk.
This is how we stay on that bridge we’ve built, pointed toward better times ahead.
Sincerely,
Tim"

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
We learned this week of a series of social media posts insulting the Muslim community. They had been made by an individual who worked part-time for our Office for Student Conflict Resolution. These posts are hurtful and antithetical to our university values of inclusivity and respect. They diminish all of us, lessen our sense of community and damage our connections with each other.
They demean our institution, and we condemn them without reservation or qualification.
That these comments were made by someone who worked for us is even more disappointing and embarrassing. This behavior is not acceptable in an office where trust, integrity and impartiality must be the bedrock of our conflict resolution process. This person performed data entry for incident reports. He was not involved in any evaluation, adjudication or decisions in the student disciplinary process. Regardless, our disciplinary system is built on a framework of honesty, respect and the promise of a fair and transparent process. The continued presence of this individual would undermine that trust and compromise our disciplinary process. As of yesterday afternoon, he is no longer employed by the university.
Our excellence as an institution is founded in creating a university that is welcoming to all people regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, political affiliation or socioeconomic background.
In a message expressing our values just two weeks ago, we said we are at our best when we engage in dialogue that encompasses the widest range of views and voices. We are free to dispute, debate and challenge ideas and opinions as we choose. But the university stands against Islamaophobia, racism and religious intolerance of any kind, and we recognize the lived experiences of everyone in our community. And we can always decide to place respect and tolerance above anger and resentment. 
This was not the choice made by the individual who posted these anti-Muslim messages. And because of that, many in our community are feeling less welcome and less at home.
All of us signing this message today extend our sincere apologies to our entire community, particularly those in our Muslim community, for the damage and pain these messages caused. You are welcome here, and we pledge to continue working to foster a supportive and safe environment for everyone who joins us at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

        Dear faculty and staff,
This message is to make you aware of a change in the way fees will be assessed for the Spring 2021 semester. The changes apply to students in campus-based degree programs and non-degree classes; a message with these changes was sent specifically to those enrolled in these programs or classes. Fee assessments for fully online programs remain unchanged.
A copy of the message distributed to students affected by this change can be found here.
 Most importantly, all students in on-campus degree programs will be assessed fees at the same rate, regardless of whether they are enrolled in a fully online schedule, and regardless of their location. 
This simplifies fee assessment and removes incentives to choose online instruction over in-person.  All students will receive a 30% fee reduction for the Spring 2021 semester.

        Dear faculty and staff,
We are entering another extremely dangerous period as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are rising rapidly in the state, with the state’s positivity rates reaching 11.4%. Cases are also increasing rapidly on our campus with the seven-day case positivity rate rising from 0.12% in mid-October to 0.62% today. We sent this message to undergraduates on Friday.
We are experiencing a concerning increase in cases among our faculty and staff. On Nov. 6, the seven-day positivity rate for faculty and staff had tripled to 0.72%, slightly higher than that of the undergraduates (0.7%). This is driven by the dramatic increase in the cases in East Central Illinois during this time period. From contact tracing, we can determine that this is not due to classroom or on-the-job transmission. The spread is likely to be through your household or social contacts.
I know that we all have pandemic fatigue, and this toll is weighing on all of us. However, we strongly believe this is a critically important time period for the safety of our entire community, and we need everyone to be more diligent than ever. I am asking that you take the following precautions beginning immediately as part of the Shield Surge plan:
Test Twice Per WeekIf you are currently participating in the on-campus COVID-19 testing program, please increase your testing frequency from once per week to twice per week, testing on Wednesday and Saturday or Wednesday and Sunday if possible. Please also test in the morning/early in the day if possible. Ensure you test and receive negative results at least every four days to maintain building access. Continue testing at this frequency until notified otherwise.
Work from Home if PossibleFor the next three weeks, please work with your supervisor to plan to work from home unless your work requires you to be on campus. Our goal is to reduce campus density to protect those who handle in-person instruction and other work that must be performed on-campus.
Participate in Essential Activities OnlyFor the next three weeks, stay home as much as possible, leaving only for essential activities, such as in-person teaching and other work that must be performed on campus, COVID-19 testing, visiting the pharmacy and buying groceries.
Limit Travel & GatheringsThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health experts tell us that gatherings and travel in and out of communities present a high risk of spreading the infection. In our current situation, with a rising prevalence in the surrounding regions, attending even small gatherings that mix households and traveling to and from the Champaign-Urbana area is not advised and is potentially dangerous. Please travel out of our community only if necessary. If you must travel, follow this travel guidance.
Thank you for your efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 in our community and for continuing to do your part to protect us all. I am so proud to be a part of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community.

        I am pleased to share information for the 2020-2021 Chancellor's Academic Professional Excellence (CAPE) Award.
The CAPE Award allows me and the University to honor academic professionals who demonstrate excellence in their work, personal and professional contributions. Academic professionals perform a wide range of critical functions for our campus community and beyond. They advise, counsel and assist our students, faculty and staff; provide critical administrative services; support our research laboratories and educational programs; and offer important outreach programs throughout the state.
Six awards are given annually and nominees are evaluated on three criteria highlighting work, personal and professional contributions. Each winner of the CAPE Award will be honored at a reception, where they will receive a $1,000 award and a commemorative plaque.
This is an opportunity for us to honor those academic professionals who contribute so much to our campus, and I urge you to take the time to nominate academic professionals for the CAPE Award. Full-time academic professionals with at least three years of full-time Academic Professional service at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are eligible. 
The deadline for submitting nominations on the CAPE nomination website, http://go.illinois.edu/capenomination, is Monday, January 4, 2021 at 5:00 p.m. If you have any questions, please contact Elyne Cole, Senior Associate Chancellor for Human Resources at e-cole1@illinois.edu. Thank you for your continued support of academic professionals and your willingness to help honor their accomplishments.

                November 6, 2020 10:57 AM
			
        Dear students,
We are entering another extremely dangerous period as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are rising extraordinarily rapidly in our community and state. Cases are also increasing rapidly on our campus, primarily among undergraduates, with the seven-day case positivity rate rising from 0.12% in mid-October to 0.57% today. This past weekend saw gatherings associated with Halloween, football and no doubt other events: in two of the first three days of this week, we had more than 80 new cases. This is the first time that has happened since Labor Day. It is extremely important that you read this entire message and follow the updated guidelines below.
By not consistently wearing masks, minimizing social gatherings, properly washing hands and getting tested, your peers’ actions have led to a concerning and rapid increase in the number of new undergraduate COVID-19 positive cases very similar to the trend we saw in August and early September. That spread was quickly brought under control by the efforts of so many of you who recognized the danger and who made the sacrifices necessary to undo the damage.
And now, I have to ask you again to help us all make it safely through the end of our semester and to let us come back together in-person in the spring. Everyone needs to do their part to protect themselves and our community. If you travel for Fall Break, we are asking you to follow the guidelines below so you do not endanger the health of your family and friends back home.
Before Fall Break 
Do not have or attend parties. Parties spread COVID-19. The result is increased transmission, innocent people getting sick or hospitalized and the need for more regional and statewide mitigation steps that affect our local businesses and restaurants. For everyone’s sake, please do not hold or attend parties.
Starting Nov. 6 (today) through Nov. 20, students who plan to travel during Fall Break must limit themselves to essential activities only, such as attending in-person class, testing, visiting the pharmacy and buying groceries.
You must continue to test during this time.
If you test positive, you must comply with Champaign-Urbana Public Health District isolation/quarantine requirements and cooperate with their contact tracing staff.
Any students who violate university, state or local health and safety requirements are subject to student discipline.
After Fall Break 
If you travel away from the Champaign-Urbana-Savoy area for Fall Break you should not return to campus until the Spring semester. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health experts tell us that travel in and out of communities presents a high risk of spreading the infection.
If you must return to campus or the local community after Fall Break, you should test for COVID-19 as soon as possible after you return to campus and self-quarantine until your results are available. You then must test every other day until Dec. 18, the end of the Fall 2020 semester.
Students who return to or have remained in the community after Fall Break must limit themselves to essential activities only, such as testing, visiting the pharmacy and buying groceries through the end of the semester.
Some study spaces will be available on a first-come, first-serve basis for those who must return. Wellness Support Associates will be checking for building access status at the entrances of study spaces, fitness centers and other university facilities.
Students who will be on-campus or in the community during breaks are required to continue their regular COVID-19 testing schedule. Students who fail to follow our testing policies are subject to student discipline.
I am asking you to be more careful in taking precautions starting right now to minimize COVID-19 spread over the Thanksgiving holiday. Protect your friends, family and community by making safe decisions. If we do not address this on-campus trend right now, we will be forced to take more extreme measures before Fall Break.
I sincerely and honestly thank all of you who have worked so very hard this semester to make the difficult choices this pandemic has required. And I recognize that the stress and fatigue of this constant effort is a heavy weight to carry. But as you have demonstrated time and again since the beginning of this pandemic, the students who choose to be part of this community always come through in the most amazing ways when you work together.
Sincerely,
Robert. J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
Governor J.B. Pritzker announced today that beginning on Monday, Nov. 2 at 12 a.m., Region 6 will go into mitigation. Please note these measures will not require us to make any changes to in-person instruction, and we will continue courses as planned. See more information about mitigation restrictions here.
From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, as a university community, we have committed to remaining adaptable and transparent to maximize the safety of our entire community. On Monday, our on-campus COVID-19 testing recorded the highest number of new positive cases and the highest single-day positivity rate since the beginning of September. Meanwhile, the numbers in our surrounding communities have begun to rise significantly as the Midwest and Illinois experience a second wave of COVID-19.
We have a number of requirements currently in place, but I am writing to ask you to be even more vigilant in taking precautions starting right now, especially in your personal lives. If we do not come together now, we will be forced to take more extreme measures.
Prioritize Your Mental Health We know this is an incredibly difficult time, and the stress and uncertainty of the semester and ongoing pandemic continues to deeply affect us all. First and foremost, please do what you need to take care of your mental and emotional health. I know many of these COVID-19 safety measures are designed to take care of you physically, but for all of us, limiting our in-person contact with others has taken a toll. I encourage you to utilize our resources for students and resources for employees.
If You Test Positive, Follow the Law  Isolation as directed by the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) is mandatory. You should not leave your residence/isolation location after receiving a positive test result until you are notified you can do so by CUPHD. If you do not follow this guidance, you will be in violation of state law. Students, faculty and staff who fail to comply with these public health directives could be subject to disciplinary action.
Limit TravelThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health experts tell us that travel in and out of communities presents a high risk of spreading the infection. In our current situation, with a rising prevalence in the surrounding region and the Chicago area, traveling to and from the Champaign-Urbana area is not advised and is potentially dangerous. Please try to travel out of our community only if necessary. If you must travel, test a few days before your scheduled travel. Then get a campus saliva test immediately upon return, self-quarantine until you receive your results, and limit your activities to essential activities such as attending work, testing, visiting the pharmacy and buying groceries until you receive two negative on-campus test results no sooner than three days apart.
Test RegularlyEven if you are not required, we encourage you to use our on-campus COVID-19 testing facilities as a resource to keep you safe. If you are required, continue your mandatory testing protocol. We are considering increased testing frequency for certain groups if it is deemed necessary.
Be More Careful in Your Off-Campus Behavior Your behavior off-campus affects you and your entire community. Whether you are considering trick-or-treat activities, celebrating football season or gathering with a small group of friends, please prioritize safety above all else and follow local guidelines for gatherings. Continue to report parties that exceed authorized size limits or other unsafe actions through this web form or by emailing conflictresolution@illinois.edu when you become aware of them.
Consider Working from HomeIf your job responsibilities allow, please work with your supervisor to continue, or perhaps increase, a schedule to work from home. We are working with supervisors to continue to fully utilize remote work flexibility where possible. I encourage supervisors to talk with staff about possibilities for increased remote work.
I know this semester has not been easy. As we move into the home stretch of the semester, I want to say thank you. I know we are all feeling the mental, physical and emotional effects of the impacts of COVID-19. This has been enormously hard. We are all feeling that weight. We need to come together, now more than ever, to ensure we can continue to maximize the safety of the community and continue fulfilling our responsibilities as the state’s flagship university. Thank you for doing your part.
Sincerely,
Robert J. Jones Chancellor"

        While ransomware and phishing attacks are an ongoing concern for the University, you may notice more attempts over the next few days and weeks. Bad actors may try to digitally impersonate University entities in order to gain access to personal data and University systems.
Keep the following in mind and act when you notice something suspicious.
Carefully review email messages or links. If you're unsure, do NOT reply to suspicious emails or visit suspicious links.
Do not blindly trust messages. Names displayed in email can be forged. Attacks are often disguised, pretending to be sent from someone you know.
Report phishing to security@illinois.edu and your local IT professional.
If you replied to a suspicious email or visited a link accidentally and later discovered it to be phishing, report it right away. State that you have been phished. You will not be in trouble; it happens, but you must report it in order to limit the effects. Log off all systems and promptly change your password using the self-service option as a precaution. https://go.illinois.edu/password
Dangerous links are often found in email, but they may also exist in compromised websites, online ads, and documents. If you see a fraudulent site pretending to be the University or any of its units, report it by emailing security@illinois.edu or calling (217) 265-0000.
To help you better spot a potential phishing or ransomware scam, please take a few moments to review these training modules from Technology Services Privacy and Security. Both are available at https://go.uillinois.edu/securitytraining.

                October 28, 2020 1:02 PM
			
        Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,
We are just a few days from an election that will help determine the next chapter in the governance in our local community, state and nation. Whatever the outcomes of this election, the deep divisions and differing perspectives we have seen will not simply disappear. But elections do offer an opportunity to step back, recalibrate and get a fresh start in finding common ground on issues that matter to every single one of us. Elections do not alter our respect for one another and human dignity that guides us here at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. And academic freedom and freedom of expression are core values.
Whether in the classroom, through scholarly exploration, on the floor of our Academic Senate, in the meetings of our student government or just walking the Quad – the free and open exchange of ideas and information is necessary for the advancement of democracy, the creation of new knowledge and the catalyst of discovery and innovation.
And it is the great diversity of our community that provides the perspectives, talents and life experiences that fuel our creativity and advance the deep, critical thinking that have established Illinois as a global educational leader. Our excellence is found in our success in creating a university that is welcoming to all people regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, political affiliation or socioeconomic background.
It is not uncommon for someone to express an idea that may anger, offend and even frighten us. And in these turbulent times, it is even easier to find a contentious topic to spark intense disagreement. But provocation does not necessarily advance a conversation toward common ground or to a shared solution. Our personal free expression need not diminish others.
We have an opportunity on Tuesday, Nov. 3 to deliver the most powerful personal expression offered to us in this country. All of our voices are equally loud and equally empowered when it comes to casting our ballots.
If you are eligible to vote in this election, we encourage you to exercise that right and make your voice heard on the issues that matter most to you. Early voting sites are now open on campus at the ARC, in the Illini Union and the University YMCA. All eligible voters can vote early and can vote at ANY of the early voting locations. You can find more information about hours and locations or to find your Election Day polling location by visiting this website. And please remember, the State of Illinois has designated Tuesday, Nov. 3 an official state holiday this year. Like other state holidays, the university will not hold any classes on that day. More information about the holiday operations can be found here.
We are at our best when we engage in dialogue that encompasses the widest range of views and voices. We will not and need not agree on every issue. We can, and should feel free to dispute, debate and challenge ideas and opinions as we choose. But we can always decide to do so in ways that preserve human dignity and recognize the lived experiences of others.
Disagreement and respect for those who disagree with us are not incompatible.
And showing compassion is always a choice we can make.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

        Dear students,
I know this semester has not been easy. We are all facing pandemic fatigue, and many of us are tired of living lives restricted by COVID-19. But just because we feel that way doesn’t mean the threat isn’t still real and pervasive.
I’m writing to remind you to continue to make choices that maximize the safety of our entire community this Halloween weekend. I encourage you to only participate and celebrate in ways that are safe and in compliance with university and CUPHD guidance. Student Affairs has planned some events, and you can view them here.
Any students who host or attend gatherings that violate state or local health and safety requirements are subject to student discipline. Since the beginning of the semester, more than 1,000 students have faced discipline, including dismissals for violations of COVID-19 policies.
Please continue to report parties that exceed authorized size limits or other unsafe actions through this web form or by emailing conflictresolution@illinois.edu when you become aware of them.
Please do not travel. The vigilance you show by staying on-campus will result in long-term gains for you and our entire campus community. The health and safety of each student, faculty and staff member is vital to our ability to finish the semester strong.
I’d also like to remind you to celebrate respectfully without engaging in inappropriate misrepresentations of cultures and minoritized communities. Avoid costumes that perpetuate cultural stereotypes, especially when it’s not your own culture. Avoid dressing in items that might be described as ""ethnic,” such as sombreros and ponchos, Native American headdresses, turbans and kimonos. It is also important to note that Blackface and Brownface are regarded as racist and insensitive.
Be considerate and refrain from making light of struggles many communities endure, such as deportation, genocide and sexual assault. Further, struggles such as homelessness or mental illness are harsh realities for many, not costumes to be taken on and off at will. Remember, although you may think it's just a costume or that you're exercising your right to freedom of expression, for many people, it's a trivialization of their culture.
We are so proud of your leadership this semester. Let’s keep progressing forward by making safe and smart decisions this weekend that respect our entire community.
Sincerely,
Dr. Danita M. B. YoungVice Chancellor for Student Affairs"

        Dear faculty and staff,  
Yesterday, after consultation with groups on campus and other universities, the Academic Senate approved the following changes to the Spring 2021 semester due to the impact of COVID-19:
Spring 2021 academic calendar changes
The first day of classes will now be Monday, Jan. 25.
There will be no Spring Break.
Three additional non-instruction days are being added: Feb. 17, March 24 and April 13.
We will be sending this message to all students announcing this change, along with additional guidance regarding our expectations for COVID-19 responsible etiquette and mandatory testing compliance in the time periods before and after Fall Break. While we would prefer to follow our regular academic calendar, including having Spring Break, the health and safety of our campus community will remain our number one priority, so we have made the adaptations listed above. The additional no-classes week at the beginning of the semester will allow the university to return our students as carefully as possible to help ensure they are in-compliance with mandatory COVID-19 testing before the semester begins.
Faculty and staff who work on-campus are encouraged to continue their regular COVID-19 testing schedule. We will continue to offer on-campus COVID-19 testing sites, even during breaks.
We are also encouraging all faculty and staff who plan to travel over the holidays to take the following precautions if they are able to do so:
Holiday travel guidance
When planning to travel, please limit yourself to essential activities like attending work and buying groceries for two weeks before you travel. This is to help protect you and your loved ones from possible virus spread. 
When you return, please test immediately upon return and limit your activities to essential activities such as attending work, testing, visiting the pharmacy and buying groceries until you receive two negative on-campus test results if you are able to do so. 
Thank you for continuing to do your part to help keep our community safe.
Sincerely,Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                October 20, 2020 9:51 AM
			
        Dear undergraduate and graduate students,
Below are some important updates on new COVID-19 requirements and precautions we are taking in the next several months, with special instructions for those students who are required to participate in the on-campus COVID-19 testing program. There is also guidance on changes to the Spring 2021 schedule. Please read this entire message to be sure you understand what is expected of you.
We are so proud of your leadership in curbing the spread of the disease here, and we ask that you follow the protocols listed below to help us continue providing some level of on-campus experience during the pandemic.
Before Fall Break 
You must continue to test, use the Safer Illinois app or the Boarding Pass, and immediately quarantine or isolate yourself, and stay quarantined and isolated, if instructed to do so by Shield or the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District.
Students who plan to travel during Fall Break should limit themselves to essential activities only, such as attending in-person class, testing, visiting the pharmacy and buying groceries between Nov. 6 and Nov. 20. Limiting your activity may help you remain COVID-free before you return home and may help keep you and those you care about safe from possible virus spread.
Any students who host or attend gatherings that violate state or local health and safety requirements are subject to student discipline. Since the beginning of the semester more than 1,000 students have faced discipline, including dismissals, for violations of COVID-19 policies, including failure to participate in COVID-19 testing.
Continue to report parties that exceed authorized size limits or other unsafe actions through this web form or by emailing conflictresolution@illinois.edu when you become aware of them.
After Fall Break (for students who return to the campus or community)
We strongly urge that if you travel away from the Champaign-Urbana-Savoy area for the holiday, you should plan to remain away until you return for the Spring semester. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health experts tell us that travel in and out of communities presents a high risk of spreading the infection.
The University will finish the Fall semester fully online, with online instruction and exams after the Fall Break. Students who remain in town during Fall Break should participate in essential activities only. 
Students who return to campus or the local community after Fall Break should test for COVID-19 as soon as possible after they return to campus. Continue to check the COVID-19 website for the most up-to-date testing site locations and hours.
Students who return to or have remained in the community after Fall Break should limit themselves to essential activities only, such as testing, visiting the pharmacy and buying groceries through the end of the semester.
Some study spaces will be available on a first-come, first-served basis. Information about locations and hours will be posted on the COVID-19 website before Fall Break. Wellness Support Associates will be checking for building access compliance at the entrances. You must be up-to-date on your COVID-19 testing requirements.
Continue to report parties that exceed size limitations or other unsafe actions through this web form or by emailing conflictresolution@illinois.edu when you become aware of them.
Students who will be on-campus or in the community during breaks are required to continue their regular COVID-19 testing schedule. We will continue to offer on-campus COVID-19 testing sites even during breaks. Students who fail to follow our testing policies are subject to student discipline.
Spring 2021 Academic Calendar & Return Guidelines
The Spring 2021 Academic Calendar has changed:
The first day of classes will now be Monday, Jan. 25.
There will be no Spring Break.
Three additional non-instruction break days are being added: Feb. 17, March 24 and April 13.

Like the fall semester, the Spring 2021 semester will include a blend of in-person and remote instruction.
Students will be required to test for COVID-19 according to the following guidelines:
Any students who travel away from campus and return for the Spring 2021 semester should limit their activities to essential and begin on-campus COVID-19 testing as soon as they return to campus. Other than participation in essential activities, those students should not leave their residence until their first test result confirms they are COVID-19 negative.
All students (undergraduate and graduate students) who are living in the Champaign-Urbana-Savoy community will be required to receive two negative on-campus test results between Jan. 15-24, no sooner than three days apart. After two negative test results, students should follow standard testing protocols to maintain testing compliance.
Students should participate only in essential activities, such as buying groceries, until they receive two negative on-campus test results.

Students are to follow these testing schedules upon returning to campus if they are able to do so:
Graduate students should be tested on Jan. 15 & 19.
Seniors should be tested on Jan. 15 & 19. (Seniors who live in University Housing will test on Jan. 17 & 21.)
Juniors should be tested on Jan. 16 & 20. (Juniors who live in University Housing will test on Jan. 17 & 21.)
Sophomores should be tested on Jan. 17 & 21.
Freshmen and new students should be tested Jan. 18 & 22.

Please give yourself plenty of time to receive two negative test results and ensure your second test is on or before Jan. 22. Students who fail to follow our testing policies are subject to student discipline.
After receiving two negative tests, students should resume their regular testing schedule.
While we would prefer to follow our regular academic calendar, including having Spring Break, the health and safety of our campus community remains our number one priority, so we have made the adaptations listed above.
Thank you all for your patience and understanding this semester. We have done what many other universities in the country have not been able to do—come back to campus and stay together.
Thank you for continuing to do your part to help keep our community safe.
Sincerely,Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Members of the University Community, 
As chancellor, I write to you at the beginning of every academic year to reaffirm our university’s commitment to equal opportunity, affirmative action, and equal access. This commitment to create and maintain an equitable and just campus community is essential to upholding the most fundamental principles of academic freedom, equity, and human dignity, which are core to the mission of the University of Illinois. The diversity of our community and the perspectives, talents, and life experiences reflected within it fuel our creativity, advance deep, critical thinking, as well as the innovations needed to address racism and social disparities to improve the world and lives.  
University policies prohibit discrimination and harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, disability, national origin, citizenship status, ancestry, age, order of protection status, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, arrest record status, unfavorable discharge from the military or status as a protected veteran. These protections extend to all members of the campus community during any stage of the employment process. This includes, but is not limited to, recruitment, selection, promotion, transfer, merit increases, salary, training and development, demotion, and separation. Similarly, the university prohibits discrimination in admissions, enrollment, and provision of services, programs, and activities. 
As a part of our affirmative action plan, consistent with state and federal laws, we undertake good faith efforts to increase the representation of women, minorities, individuals with disabilities, and veterans among our faculty and staff. An affirmative action plan is essential to furthering equal employment opportunity and diversity on our campus, and to fulfill our affirmative action obligations. 
The Office for Access & Equity is available to assist any employees who have concerns about discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. You can submit a discrimination or harassment claim through the university’s online reporting portal (accessible claim form). To learn more about OAE’s broader services related to equity, affirmative action, and disability-related matters, please see the Office for Access & Equity website. You can also review the nondiscrimination policy and sexual misconduct policy  and procedures for addressing Title IX sexual harassment complaints online. Retaliation against any person for exercising their rights under these policies is strictly prohibited.  
The ADA Division of the Office for Access and Equity facilitates disability, religious, and pregnancy/parenting accommodations for all faculty, staff, undergraduate and graduate student employees, as well as job applicants. The ADA Division engages in an interactive process to determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation for each person. The division also provides advice, consultation, and educational programming to increase awareness and inclusion of individuals with diverse abilities. To request a reasonable accommodation, employees can complete the online employee accommodation request form (accessible reasonable accommodations request form). Students can learn more about the student academic supports and accommodations services that may be available to them by contacting the Division of Disability Resources & Educational Services.
We recently shared an update to the Title IX and Other Sexual Misconduct Policies and Procedures and want to reemphasize our commitment to providing prevention education and training, resources, and supportive measures to address sexual misconduct in our community. Please visit the We Care website to learn more about confidential and non-confidential resources, university policies, disciplinary procedures, rights and options, and additional information related to the prevention, reporting, and response to sexual misconduct. Questions regarding Title IX may also be sent to the U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights.  
Realizing our shared vision of an inclusive campus requires that we all annually reaffirm our individual commitment. We have a responsibility to act with courage, generosity, and boldness. Only together can we build a truly diverse, welcoming, and inclusive university community of students, scholars and staff. 
Sincerely,

Dear Students,
We hope that you are well, and the semester has been off to a smooth start. Last fall, the campus launched the Student Success Initiative. Chancellor Jones noted the Student Success Initiative is an effort to better identify the factors that lead to positive and productive experiences for our undergraduate students. Last year we gathered valuable data from faculty, staff, and students! This year, our focus will be on using the data collected and recommendations to implement change on campus.
We are seeking a diverse group of students to serve on our Provost Undergraduate Student Advisory Board. We hope you will consider applying to be involved in providing additional feedback and helping us to operationalize the recommendations provided through their lens. Student voice is a critical part of student success; thus, we need your valuable input to continue improving our campus community. 
View the application and frequently asked questions. If selected to participate as a Board member, appointments will be for one full academic year. All applications will be due by Friday, October 9, 2020 at 11:59pm CDT.

        Dear Colleagues,
We are pleased to announce the release of a brief video resource about campus sustainability from the Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment (iSEE).
This informational video will appear on the University of Illinois System Ethics and Compliance website in conjunction with the annual faculty and staff ethics training. It will also be posted to the Illinois Media Space for use in your courses and beyond. By participating in this module, you will receive:
A general overview of several campus sustainability goals
Pertinent information about the Illinois Climate Action Plan (iCAP) 2020
Best practices for incorporating our campus-wide sustainability commitments into daily life
Following the video, you are invited to provide feedback about how the university can continue reducing campus waste, energy consumption and carbon emissions.
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is a model for sustainability. It is our goal to continue leading by example and pursuing progressive solutions. We are proud of our accomplishments while also recognizing there is more we must do.
At an individual level, you too can model sustainable decision-making for your peers and make choices that impact the campus and community, such as: reducing food waste, avoiding single-use items and choosing to take, use and purchase no more than what is needed.
Our resources are valuable, and now is a critical time to make a personal commitment to each do our part to preserve and sustain them.
We hope you will take a few minutes to watch this video, respond to the questions and become more involved in campus sustainability opportunities.
Our actions do make a measureable difference.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

        Dear campus community member:
Each year around this time, we publish our Annual Security and Fire Safety Report which includes statistics from the previous three years concerning crime that occurred on campus, in certain off-campus buildings or on property owned or controlled by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The report additionally includes statistics for fires which occurred in on-campus student housing, fire safety policies and procedures, institutional policies concerning campus security, and other safety information.
Creating and maintaining a safe community is a responsibility that the University of Illinois Police Department and Campus Code Compliance and Fire Safety take very seriously. However, we cannot do it alone. Crime and fire prevention is a community effort, and you are our most valuable public safety resource. By reviewing this report, you are partnering with us to take the necessary steps to look out for yourself and others and to create a safer campus community for everyone.
Toward this end, and in compliance with federal regulations and the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Crime Statistics Act, a copy of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Annual Security and Fire Safety Report is available online at police.illinois.edu/clery.
A hard copy of the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report may be obtained by visiting the U. of I. Public Safety Building at 1110 W. Springfield Ave., Urbana, IL 61801, or by contacting 217-333-1216. You may also review the Daily Crime Log at the front desk of the U. of I. Public Safety Building or online at police.illinois.edu/crime-reporting/daily-crime-log.
In addition to reviewing this report, there are other important steps you can take to enhance your own safety on campus:
Sign up for Illini-Alert text messages by visiting emergency.illinois.edu.
Review campus safety measures at police.illinois.edu/safety.
Take a minute to prepare for emergencies at police.illinois.edu/safe.
Review sexual violence and misconduct resources available to the campus community at wecare.illinois.edu.
We hope that you review these important resources and use the information to promote your own awareness. Together, we can continue to make the campus community a safer place where education, research and public service can flourish.
Sincerely,
Alice CaryExecutive Director of Public Safety/Chief of Police
Craig GrantAssociate Director, Campus Code Compliance and Fire Safety"

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
As we continue to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19, I am asking you to take one more step to maximize the safety of our entire community. Please, get a flu shot. This is an extremely important year to prioritize getting your flu vaccination to help ensure we are each doing what we can to support our local healthcare system, so they can allocate their resources to fighting COVID-19. It is our goal to have everyone in our university community get a flu shot before the end of October. Consider taking this simple action to protect yourself and others.
McKinley Health Center is providing free flu shots to all students who have paid the Health Service Fee. The seasonal flu shot is also available to benefit eligible faculty, staff and retirees. There are several locations across campus between now and the end of October:
Campus Recreation Center East (CRCE)Now-Nov. 20 (Monday-Friday)
Activities & Recreation Center (ARC)Sept. 28-30
Grainger Engineering LibraryOct. 5-8
Business Instructional Facility (BIF)Oct. 12-15
Veterinary Medicine Oct. 20-21
Student Dining and Residential Programs Building (SDRP)Oct. 22-23
Click here for hours & more details.
To learn more about who is eligible, times, locations and components of the vaccine, please visit the McKinley Health Center website. If you plan to come to campus, please keep in mind that you must be up-to-date on your COVID-19 on-campus testing.
If you are a faculty or staff member, and it is more convenient to get a flu shot off-campus, please consider doing so. Carle Hospital and Christie Clinic are both offering flu shots for patients.
Thank you for doing your part to help protect our community.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:
I would like to share the details about the next step in our university’s Call to Action to Address Racism and Social Injustice with you. I have charged a Steering Committee and four working groups to identify the work that we must commit to now in order to create a campus that is free of structural and systemic racism and bias. The Steering Committee aims to place our institutional values of diversity, equity, and inclusion at the heart of every aspect of what we do as an institution. We will not generate another list of what should change. Instead we will develop the frameworks, the concrete steps that we will take, the tangible goals that we will meet, and the barriers we will remove to create the foundation for lasting, positive systemic change throughout the University of Illinois.
These are the committees that have been charged:
Steering Committee (Chair: Vice Chancellor Sean Garrick)View the Steering Committee charge letter and members
Teaching and Scholarship (Chairs: Dean James Anderson and Vice Provost Kevin Pitts) View the Teaching and Scholarship charge letter and members
Diversity and a Culture of Inclusion (Chairs: Humanities Research Institute Director Antoinette Burton and Dean Kevin Hamilton) View the Diversity and a Culture of Inclusion charge letter and members

Community Action and Public Engagement (Chairs: Executive Associate Chancellor Wanda Ward and Vice Chancellor Danita Brown Young)View the Community Action and Public Engagement charge letter and members
It is now time for this university to place our deep abundance of knowledge, will, and expertise into motion to change the assumptions that inform our decisions to consider the necessary and difficult questions that we need to ask of ourselves as a university. Who are we not listening to? Who are we failing to serve? How must we reallocate both our attention and our resources? Only then will we fundamentally restructure the way we educate our community of scholars, reimagine how we understand our responsibilities to protect one another, establish shared community norms of inclusion, as well as use the knowledge of our university experts to partner with the people of Champaign-Urbana and serve the public good.
I have requested to receive a final report from the steering committee by June 1, 2021.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

Early voting begins in Illinois tomorrow and is already underway in other areas of the country. And there is still time to complete the census by the Sept. 30 deadline and ensure that the areas in which we live are fairly represented in Congress and receive their share of vital federal funding.

                September 20, 2020 10:01 AM

        Dear campus community member:
We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, you can view the daily crime log.
Within the past three weeks, three vehicles have been reported stolen from the area of Green and Sixth streets, Champaign. In at least one of the incidents, the vehicle was left running and unattended:
Aug. 30: Vehicle stolen near Green and Sixth streets.
Sept. 5: Vehicle stolen at 616 E. Green St.
Sept. 19: Vehicle stolen at 606 S. Sixth St.
We are aware of additional reports of stolen vehicles in off-campus areas, though it is not clear if the incidents are related to each other. While we do not have reason to believe these incidents present a threat to anyone’s physical safety, we felt it important to issue this notice in order to prevent similar crimes from occurring. Please keep your vehicle locked at all times, and report any suspicious activity you might have witnessed. Additional crime prevention tips are listed below.
The University of Illinois Police Department, in cooperation with the Champaign Police Department and the Urbana Police Department, has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area. Between these agencies, our campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 2,100 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information is encouraged to contact the Champaign Police Department at 217-351-4545. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android. All messages to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of identifying information and forwarded to police by an independent third party.
This is our community. Let's stay together.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Watch your belongings. Theft is the most common crime on college campuses everywhere, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is no exception. Lock up or secure your personal belongings whenever possible, even if they are sitting right next to you. Do not leave your vehicle running if it is unattended.
Lock your doors. The easiest way to prevent theft and burglary is by locking the door to your vehicle or residence. Criminals often will look for an open door or window to steal your items.
Hide it, or better yet, bring it with you. Do not leave valuables in plain sight, and never leave car keys with the vehicle. Make sure to hide valuables if you have to leave them in the car, or do not leave them in the car at all.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.

                September 16, 2020 1:17 PM

        Dear Students,
On September 2, I asked you to limit your in-person activities for two weeks to quickly reverse a concerning increase in positive cases. We have made some progress in that time, and our new case numbers and positivity rate are moving down. But, we are still very much at a tipping point, and new cases could quickly and completely erase all of your progress and hard work. 
While we can’t yet celebrate, you will be able to carefully and responsibly resume some COVID-19-limited versions of activities you all miss.
So, in eight words, here are the rules I’m going to ask you to follow for the next few weeks. I can say the words, but, as always, it is your actions that will make the difference.
No parties. Small, safe gatherings only. Smart decisions.
Limit gatherings to 10 people or fewer, have them outside if possible and always with social distancing and face coverings.
Continue to report large parties or other unsafe actions through this web form or by emailing conflictresolution@illinois.edu when you see them.
You must continue to test twice a week, use the Safer Illinois app or the Boarding Pass, and immediately quarantine or isolate yourself, and stay quarantined and isolated, if instructed to do so.
Some of you will be asked to begin testing three times a week, if we determine you are at a high risk for contracting COVID-19.
You must follow any directions you receive from the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. Ignoring or violating CUPHD is not just dangerous, it is breaking the law and could result in suspension from the university.
Avoid crowded places, especially in enclosed spaces – whether parties, private houses or apartments – where exposure to the virus is more likely.
Don’t risk your health by going to businesses that aren’t following public health guidelines about face coverings, occupancy limits or social distancing.
I ask that you follow these rules whether you are on campus or off campus and whether it is 8 in the morning or 11:30 at night.
There is no shortage of recent, national stories about super-spreader events. One infected person, without a mask, talking loudly, in a crowded place can start a chain of transmission that can lead to hundreds of people infected and deaths of those who were not even there. This has happened at weddings, funerals, parties, on buses and in restaurants. It can happen right here. And if it does, your sacrifices of the past couple of weeks will have been wasted.
You came back this semester because you wanted the kind of in-person experiences – in and out of the classroom – that college life should include. We are going to do something about those out-of-class experiences, starting right now and on a scale a little more like we are used to here at Illinois.
Introducing new in-person campus events 
Student Affairs is working together with the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics and a number of RSOs to launch a series of new in-person events.
These kick off at 9 p.m. this Friday with a double feature movie night on the Memorial Stadium screen.
Saturday night will feature a live, free concert from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m.
Starting next week, every Thursday will be another double feature night, and every Friday and Saturday will feature live entertainment in the stadium.
Attendance at all of these events will be limited according to local and state rules on allowable occupancy and the ability to maintain social distancing. Face coverings will be required.
Visit go.illinois.edu/activities for details about the events organized by the Illini Union Board, Campus Recreation and other campus groups, the new ones that will be added all semester, as well as the rules that will be in place for every event.
We are going to be asking you for more ideas about how we can help you connect safely, and our Wellness Ambassadors will be out on campus sharing small rewards with students who are following good COVID-19 safety practices.
You have made it clear by your decisions these past two weeks that you are committed to staying together this semester. Please don’t let up now. We will continue to monitor the data and reassess our approach quickly as necessary.
I know how frustrating this is. It is not normal.
And with every single day, my respect and admiration for you grows as I watch you rise to whatever the next challenge may be.
Thank you, and please keep up the very hard work.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Colleagues,
I will be sending the massmail message below to our undergraduate students later today. Over these past two weeks, their efforts to limit themselves to essential activities has led to an encouraging drop in new cases and in our positivity rate. Because of this progress we are allowing them to carefully and responsibly resume some COVID-19-limited in-person activities. We are also announcing a series of campus-organized events to offer our students more opportunities to safely come together throughout the rest of the semester.
We will also continue our efforts to quickly identify and discipline students who are not complying with our COVID-19 rules or with Champaign-Urbana Public Health District orders.
We have seen a reversal in the upward trend in cases, but we will continue to monitor our testing data and reassess our approach as necessary. We will always be prepared to move quickly and decisively to transition the rest of the semester to fully remote instruction if necessary.
The vast majority of our undergraduate students are doing what we ask and are making the smart, daily decisions that will let us continue our in-person semester.
I am very proud of their efforts and of their collective commitment to taking care of our entire community.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

                September 15, 2020 4:19 PM

        Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,
As we shared in a message to the university community in May, the U.S. Department of Education released new regulations to guide the application of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which protects persons from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance. Our position since May has not wavered: federal regulations may change, but our collective responsibility to prevent and respond to sexual misconduct extends well beyond minimum compliance. As we embark on a new academic year, the University of Illinois remains fully committed to the goal of preventing and responding to sexual misconduct.
Today, we write to let you know about the new formal investigation and resolution processes that are now in place in compliance with the new Title IX regulations. The new regulations focus on a narrowed range of conduct and define the process that we must follow. For this range of conduct, a team of campus experts worked throughout the summer to implement new procedures—including a fair and equitable live hearing with cross-examination—in a manner that is attentive toward caring for survivors and providing supportive measures for educational access. A full description of the new policy, process, and information about reporting obligations, as well as the provision of confidential advisors under Title IX, is maintained centrally on the We Care: Sexual Misconduct Support, Response, and Prevention website.
Danielle Morrison, our university’s Title IX Coordinator, provides oversight and support for the university’s comprehensive Title IX programs and initiatives. Dr. Morrison can be reached at titleixcoordinator@illinois.edu or (844) 616-7978.
The work to prevent and respond to sexual misconduct in our university community does not stop with the implementation of new Title IX processes. Beyond the conduct covered by the new regulations, the U.S. Department of Education also allows each university to define broader categories of behavior to which we will hold the members of our community responsible.
The Sexual Misconduct Policy in the Campus Administrative Manual and Student Code has therefore been revised to include other prohibited sexual misconduct in addition to Title IX Sexual Harassment. These policies are based on a comprehensive understanding of the ways that sexual misconduct undermines the educational, research, and service missions of the University and reflect the work of the Committee on Faculty Sexual Misconduct and other campus stakeholders. We are committed to ensuring that the campus community is safe from all forms of sexual misconduct, and we will continue to enhance and expand on these processes so that we may uphold the expectations of our university and our shared values.
An updated statement regarding the U.S. Department of Education’s new regulations was published by the University of Illinois System on August 14, 2020: University of Illinois System Statement on Sex Discrimination, Sexual Harassment and Other Sexual Misconduct.
Regardless of where you are this academic year, either on campus in Urbana-Champaign or remote across the globe, we want you to know that you can still receive support if you need it. Anyone who experiences sexual misconduct — including sexual harassment, sexual assault, and other forms of sexual violence — should know that you are not alone, and that help is available. We encourage all students, faculty, and staff to learn more, stand up against harmful behavior, and get involved in our effort to create and maintain a safe and respectful campus community.
Sincerely,

                September 15, 2020 10:32 AM

          Dear colleagues:
I’m pleased to announce the start of something new and exciting from the University of Illinois System.
The U of I System is introducing “Rising to the Challenge,” a new podcast dedicated to telling stories from across the system and our universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield.
Like few other times in our history, we are being called on now to meet myriad challenges. And I believe the stories behind just how those tests are being met can and will inspire and inform all of us.
How do you create a fast, new saliva-based test to detect COVID-19 and change the thinking about what’s possible as we work to restore the educational, economic and social life of our universities, our state and our country? What’s involved in creating a new vaccine that can help us do all of that? And how do we meet the long list of other challenges created by a pandemic?
Our first few episodes will tell the stories behind those questions and many more.
The podcast is being produced in cooperation with Illinois Public Media and will be hosted by Gwen Macsai, an award-winning veteran of audio storytelling who is based in Chicago. Producer Libby Foster is an award-winning journalist also based in Chicago and formerly of Illinois Public Media’s ""The 21st"" talk show. Both are graduates of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
You can find “Rising to the Challenge” at WILL, our partner in this endeavor, as well as on Apple and Google podcasts, and Spotify.
I hope you'll find the podcast interesting and inspiring.
Sincerely,Tim"

                September 15, 2020 12:22 AM

        Dear campus community member:
We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This Campus Safety Notice is issued in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about crime to aid in the prevention of similar crimes and to assist in the identification of offenders.
This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, you can view the daily crime log.
The following robbery took place at 11:12 p.m. on Monday, Sept. 14, in the 200 block of East Gregory Drive (map), in Champaign:
A U. of I. student was approached by four men who pushed the student to the ground and took the student’s cash and other property. The group then ran to the north. No one appeared to have a weapon. The student was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.
The University of Illinois Police Department, in cooperation with the Champaign Police Department and the Urbana Police Department, has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area. Between these agencies, our campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 2,000 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android. All messages to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of identifying information and forwarded to police by an independent third party.
Our community. Our safety.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks escort if you need one.
Be alert. Maintaining awareness of your surroundings is critical, especially when traveling at night. Wearing headphones or looking at your phone diminishes your ability to respond to your surroundings. Walk with purpose, and stay attentive.
Trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.
If you choose to consume alcohol, please be responsible. Remember your ability to respond is diminished by overconsumption of alcohol.
Please take a moment to review these resources we have made available to keep you informed, and consider liking UIPD on Facebook, following us on Twitter or subscribing to our news feed to receive regular updates.

                September 7, 2020 7:04 PM

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
We want to thank the many students who have followed the guidelines Chancellor Jones established last week to curb the spread of COVID-19. Our collective efforts this past week are showing encouraging results, and we must continue that momentum in the weeks ahead.
We are writing today to share that data collected from the start of on-campus Shield saliva testing system show two findings that allow us to move to a more targeted testing approach to expedite the detection of positive cases and more quickly contain the spread of COVID-19. Since testing began over the summer, our Shield program has been highly effective at detecting and isolating cases among faculty, staff and graduate students, and we know the number of cases among those groups is extremely low. At this point, more than 95% of all new cases are among undergraduate students.
For those reasons, beginning tomorrow, Tuesday, Sept. 8:
For Faculty, Staff and Graduate Students:
For this week only, we ask that you refrain from getting tested tomorrow, Tuesday, Sept. 8. 
All faculty, staff and graduate students will now move to a once-per-week test schedule. Even though not required, you may continue on a twice-weekly schedule if you choose. 
If at all possible, please test on Saturdays or Sundays. If weekends are not possible for you, please test on Wednesdays. This will help even the number of tests to be processed each day and will mean shorter lines and faster results for everyone. 
Faculty, staff and graduate students must still show a Wellness Support Associate their Safer Illinois app or Boarding Pass at building entrances. WSAs will work to implement this change. You should also bring your i-card to show you are part of this testing group. 

For Undergraduate Students:
You must continue your twice-per-week test schedule. You can choose Monday-Thursday, Tuesday-Friday, or Wednesday-Saturday/Sunday, schedules. Undergraduate students must still show a Wellness Support Associate their Safer Illinois app or Boarding Pass at building entrances.
Some undergraduate students may be directly contacted and asked to test three times a week if we believe you might have a higher risk of recent exposure. 

This new more targeted approach will provide test results more quickly and will allow the university to connect those students with information and resources more quickly upon receiving a positive test.
We are confident these adjustments in our testing schedule will help us further reduce our positivity rate and show the world that our innovative approach can help us all move forward together in these challenging times.

Today, we are asking for your help to ensure we can continue on-campus operations.
We need to reduce the time it takes to return COVID-19 test results. So, if you are willing to test this Saturday or Sunday and then continue to test on a Wednesday-weekend schedule, you can help relieve overwhelming demand on the processing center on the highest-demand days (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday). Several testing locations across campus are open over the holiday weekend.
With this small modification in testing scheduled, we can even the flow of testing throughout the week and make our program stronger for everyone.
We continue to improve and innovate in our multi-faceted approach, and we are grateful for your assistance in making it even better and getting testing results to everyone faster.
Thank you for your continued patience and personal leadership as we move forward.

          Dear students, faculty and staff:
We began the fall semester with what we believe are the right tools to come back to campus: a strict regimen of COVID-19 testing using the rapid-result SHIELD test developed by our own scientists and a set of common-sense guidelines to help everyone avoid the most risky situations.
It became clear this week through a rise in COVID-19 cases that some students at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have not been adhering to those guidelines.
In response, Chancellor Robert Jones is taking the difficult-but-necessary step of identifying and even removing those who decline to make the sacrifices required to allow all of us to stay on campus this fall.
The chancellor and the leadership team at Urbana-Champaign also have implored students to limit their activities over the next two weeks to only the absolute essentials: twice-weekly SHIELD COVID-19 tests, classes, buying groceries and food, going to work, individual outdoor activity, religious services and seeking medical attention.
These are manageable, short-term sacrifices, steps not unlike those being taken by people around the globe right now as we navigate the pandemic.
These short-range steps have the power to keep us all here. But without them, the partially in-person fall semester that we’ve begun is at risk.
So please, take this seriously.
The world is watching the University of Illinois System right now, wondering if we are capable of managing this virus. We are, with everyone’s commitment and involvement.

        Dear Students and Employees,
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act requires the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:
http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/
The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.
Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to marijuana in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s marijuana prohibition.
The university’s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.
The university’s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.
Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. University employees should contact Illinois Human Resources at (217) 333-2137.

Wednesday afternoon, the Chancellor sent an email to all undergraduate students concerning the Increased Enforcement of COVID-19 Safety Guidelines. In the email, Chancellor Jones directed students to avoid traveling or attending large gatherings over the Labor Day weekend. Many of our positive cases these first two weeks were brought from communities without the level of testing we have.
I am writing to echo his instruction. Do not travel this holiday weekend. The vigilance you show by staying on-campus will result in long-term gains for you and our entire campus community. As an Illini family, the health and safety of each student, faculty, and staff member is vital to our ability to remain on-campus through the duration of the semester.
As you limit your in-person interactions to only the most essential activities, please know that there is still plenty for you to do; here are some ideas:
Check out these virtual and on-campus activities.
Also be sure to view Student Affairs’ COVID-19 Support Resources for a listing of facilities and their availability as well as websites for your favorite campus locations to find activities you can participate in.
If you must travel, please limit interactions to only those in your immediate family unit. Once you return to the community, go as soon as possible to a testing site, and take a COVID-19 test. While you wait for your results, be cautious and limit time spent outside of your residence, continue wearing your face covering and social distancing in public areas, and continue washing your hands multiple times per day.
Remember, all students need to take a COVID-19 test and receive a negative result in order to regain access to academic buildings.
To quote the Chancellor, “We’ve given ourselves a real chance to come together and to stay together. But the decision to do so is in your hands.”
Be well, be safe, and please choose to stay on-campus over the Labor Day weekend.
Sincerely,
Dr. Danita M. B. YoungVice Chancellor for Student Affairs"

          Dear colleagues:
I am delighted to announce the 2020-21 President’s Executive Leadership Program (PELP) Fellows. The selection process this year was very competitive; we received more than 80 nominations from across our three universities for the limited number of slots available. Diversity of background and experiences, as well as university representation were factors in the selection process. 
PELP is a unique professional development program designed to broaden participants’ understanding of higher education issues and to strengthen their leadership skills related to overseeing a public institution at the university or system level. The program consists of four seminars that take place in Washington, D.C.; Chicago; Springfield; and Urbana-Champaign. 
This program is especially important at this time, given the pandemic and the importance of strong leadership. Please join me in congratulating the following individuals who were selected for the 2020-21 program.
Chicago• Amy T. Campbell, Associate Dean for Law and Health Sciences and Professor of Law, UIC John Marshall Law School• Jered B.

                September 2, 2020 1:16 PM

        Dear Students,
Over these past few days, the irresponsible actions of a small number of students have created the very real possibility of ending an in-person semester for all of us. Their poor choices have led to a concerning and rapid increase in the number of new undergraduate COVID-19 positive cases. We know the majority of you reading this message are following the university’s COVID-19 guidance, and we are grateful to all of you who have worked so hard to help by doing your part.
For two weeks, starting now, we are intensifying our efforts to identify and swiftly remove those individuals who have created this unacceptable risk for our campus and community and who have undermined your hard work to stay together. Students who continue to violate our safety policies, who fail to comply with directions from our public health officials and who engage in unsafe activities that risk spreading the virus will be asked to leave this university. 
We believe the damage done by these individuals can be reversed. But it must be done quickly. And it will require those of you who have been working so hard this semester to shoulder even more responsibility in these next two weeks.
For two weeks, starting today at 5 p.m., for your own protection, we expect all undergraduate students to limit their in-person interactions to only the most essential activities. These include things like taking twice weekly COVID-19 tests, attending class, purchasing groceries and food, going to work, engaging in individual outdoor activity, attending religious services and seeking medical attention.
And here is the hardest part. We need you to strictly avoid social gatherings under any circumstances for these two weeks. We know what we are asking with this. Being together with friends is a big part of why you chose to come back. And for our freshmen, opening your college experience with the same isolation that ended your high school career is intensely disappointing.
It is not fair that you will be the ones to fix a situation you did not cause. But this is where we are now, and this is what it will take to repair the damage in time to break the cycle of increasing new cases. Two weeks now gives you the chance for the rest of the semester together. Why Are We Doing This Now?
Real-time data from our Shield testing program allowed us to quickly detect a rapidly emerging increase in positive cases that will force us to return to fully remote instruction for the rest of the semester if we do not take immediate action to break the cycle.
Some students have ignored the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) directives to isolate or quarantine, choosing to go out even knowing they are positive for the virus.
Some students who have tested positive are actively avoiding our contact tracers and some have repeatedly returned to testing facilities attempting to “test out” of their positive status, which is not permissible under CUPHD protocols.
Some students have made active efforts to circumvent the Safer Illinois app.
Over the weekend, we received 11 complaints about large gatherings inside fraternities and private houses.
Over the weekend, we responded to more than 100 party-related calls.
The university has identified more than 400 new positive cases since the first day of instruction, Aug. 24, and about twice as many individuals are currently in quarantine. The number of new cases we have seen in the past several days has been progressing at a rate that will double every seven days without the actions we are asking of you.
Discipline for Non-Compliance & Dangerous Behavior
For the first week of classes, we focused on education, but now we are focusing on the individuals who are endangering everyone in our community. Here are some of the actions already taken to address these issues:
A student was issued an interim suspension for hosting a large party at his apartment on Friday.
Another student was issued an interim suspension for violation of a quarantine order on Saturday.
A student who posted a video on social media attempting to show people how to circumvent the Safer Illinois app is facing discipline.
The Pi Kappa Phi fraternity has been placed on interim suspension after another large party this weekend.
Approximately 100 additional students and organizations are facing disciplinary action for their behavior over the weekend.
These violations are unacceptable, and as we identify more individuals who are being irresponsible, they should be prepared to interrupt their studies and leave campus. Students who do not comply with campus COVID-19 rules or who fail to follow any instructions from Champaign-Urbana Public Health District will face immediate suspension. 
The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs has substantially increased staffing to monitor large gatherings, parties and other unacceptable activities in University Housing and throughout the Campustown area. In addition to possible city fines, party hosts will also be subject to immediate suspension. That office is also working in collaboration with CUPHD to more quickly identify and contact undergraduate students who have tested positive or been in close contact with those who have. Students who refuse to comply with quarantine or isolation directions will face immediate suspension. Student Affairs has established this confidential web form to allow you to report unsafe activities or behavior.  
What We Need You to Do to Help
If you receive a call from Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (beginning with a 217 or 312 area code), respond immediately and follow their guidance about quarantine and isolation. If you don’t, you will be in violation of state law, and you will be suspended from the university.
Limit your in-person activities only to essentials like twice weekly COVID-19 tests, attending class, purchasing groceries and food, going to work, engaging in individual outdoor activity, attending religious services and seeking medical attention.
Avoid traveling or attending large gatherings over the Labor Day weekend. Many of our positive cases these first two weeks were brought from communities without the level of testing we have.
Remember that in addition to university disciplinary action for violation of rules, you could also be subject to fines of up to $750 per day per violation of the COVID-19 related emergency orders from the cities of Urbana or Champaign.
If you see any non-compliance, please document the evidence and submit it through this web form. You can do so confidentially. If you see something, please let us know about it.
Please Follow the Rules
We are continually monitoring our total number of COVID-19 cases and positivity rates, and each act of non-compliance affects the trajectory of the Fall 2020 semester.
We have created the most extensive testing process of any university in the country. We have extensively modeled to make the best science-driven decisions. We have invented a new COVID-19 test. We’ve created a new app to ensure building access and academic standing are linked to testing compliance. Seven teams have worked since the spring to do everything we could possibly think of to make your Illinois experience as normal as possible.
We’ve given ourselves a real chance to come together and to stay together.
But the decision to do so is in your hands.
We stay together. Or we go home.
It comes down to these next two weeks.
It is up to you.

These include things like taking twice weekly COVID-19 tests, attending class, purchasing groceries and food, going to work, engaging in individual outdoor activity, attending religious services and seeking medical attention.
We have seen the majority of our students respond voluntarily and positively this semester and we expect these temporary restrictions to be adopted. Fortunately, our Shield testing program identified this trend early, and there is no evidence of any spread from students to instructors or to the broader local community.
The full massmail we will send to undergraduate students in a few minutes is included below with details about what we expect them to do and more information about our increased focus on compliance and enforcement.
These actions will repair much of the damage a few irresponsible students have caused, and this should flatten the curve.
But, if this approach does not successfully reverse this upward trend, we will move quickly and decisively to transition the rest of the semester to fully remote instruction.
The choices of our students in the next two weeks will determine the rest of our semester.
Sincerely
Robert J. JonesChancellorAndreas C. CangellarisProvostDanita M. B. YoungVice Chancellor for Student Affairs

                September 11, 2020 3:01 PM

        Effective September 15, 2020, as part of our commitment to NAGPRA and to the concerns of Tribal Nations, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will implement a moratorium on research, teaching, display, imaging, and circulation of human remains and cultural items that are potentially subject to NAGPRA at the University, including all on-site collections in the University's custody or collections that the University has loaned to other organizations.
Dear Colleagues:
As a federally funded land-grant institution, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has an ethical and legal responsibility to acknowledge the Tribal Nations on whose land we reside and to curate and repatriate Native American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian human remains and funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony (collectively, “cultural items”) in a respectful, dignified, and legally compliant manner. The University is consulting with Tribal Nations regarding human remains and cultural items in University collections, in accordance with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. § 3001 et seq., 43 CFR Part 10; collectively, “NAGPRA”). Part of that effort involves establishing a moratorium on some activities: research, teaching, display, imaging, and circulation of human remains and cultural items that are potentially subject to NAGPRA at the University, including all on-site collections in the University's custody or collections that the University has loaned to other organizations.
The campus has established a NAGPRA Office within the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation to lead this work, with support from an Advisory Committee. The moratorium actively affirms the University’s commitment to respect the sovereignty of Tribal Nations in our research, teaching, and museum practices, and will remain in effect until the University’s NAGPRA Advisory Committee establishes procedures for review of access requests. The moratorium was developed in consultation with the Office of the Provost and the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion.  
The NAGPRA Office is responsible for the University’s inventory, documentation, consultation, and repatriation efforts under NAGPRA. Its work to fulfill the University's legal obligations is exempted from this moratorium. Certain projects, particularly those that have received explicit tribal permissions, may be eligible for interim review by the NAGPRA Advisory Committee. Their recommendations will be considered for approval by the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation, in consultation with the NAGPRA Officer.
For more specific information regarding the moratorium and interim review process, please visit the University’s NAGPRA web page and contact the NAGPRA Program Officer (nagpra@illinois.edu) with further questions.
Sincerely,

                September 1, 2020 4:09 PM

        Dear campus community member:
We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes on or immediately adjacent to campus property.
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes.
The University of Illinois Police Department was informed by a Campus Security Authority that a student was sexually assaulted at 12:20 a.m. on Monday, Aug. 31, at a fraternity house by a person known to the victim.
In instances of sexual offenses, we generally do not include specific details about exact locations or times to avoid releasing information that could lead to the identification of a survivor, unless that information is of vital importance to the safety of the campus community. We do this to reduce the possibility that a survivor becomes the target of retaliation, harassment or further psychological harm.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to assist the person involved in this incident and will continue to take actions to maintain the safety and security of the campus community.
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.
If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another person, intervene if it’s safe to do so or call for assistance.
While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. The university, community organizations and local law enforcement offer a number of reporting options.
Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.
It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
A new University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign course, COV-Course: A Multidisciplinary Approach to Understanding the Pandemic, will offer a comprehensive, interdisciplinary understanding of the pandemic.
This non-credit course is free and open to the local community, students, parents, staff, faculty and alumni. Classes will be live streamed online from 8:00–9:00 p.m. every Sunday evening during the fall semester, starting Sept. 6. Each session will be archived on covid19.illinois.edu. You can view the course schedule and register here.
The course will showcase how interdisciplinary research and expertise can offer unique perspectives on this global health crisis. Each session will guide you through past, present and future perspectives on the pandemic, with weekly topics that range from history, biology and business to data security, racial disparities, mental health and more.
It will be led by an array of world-class University of Illinois scientists, humanists, social scientists and artists who will share their knowledge and insights about the pandemic and its consequences.
This program was built with support from the Office of the Provost, the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology, the Center for Social and Behavioral Science, the Humanities Research Institute, the Interdisciplinary Health Sciences Institute, the Siebel Center for Design, the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences and the Grainger College of Engineering.
I hope you’ll join me in learning more from our expert Illinois scholars and practitioners through this unique opportunity.

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
Congratulations on your efforts this week. I hope you enter this weekend with a sense of pride that is tempered by the honest recognition that we cannot celebrate or let up now.
Thank you for wearing your face coverings, for practicing social distancing, for getting your COVID-19 tests and for responding quickly if you learned of a positive test or were contacted by our public health officials.
Thank you for showing patience and kindness as you waited to get tested or to enter your building or classroom as we continue to learn and adjust.
And thank you to the staff of our testing sites and analytical laboratory who are now processing as many as 2.7% of all the COVID-19 tests in this country on a given day. You can find campus testing data here. 
As our models predicted, these first days saw our overall positivity rate remain well below that of the rest of the state even as positive tests were returned. This rapid testing, combined with the contact tracing efforts of the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District, has let us quickly help those who tested positive or have possibly been exposed to the virus find quarantine space to limit the spread.
Our rapid, comprehensive and uniquely Illinois saliva-based test and data models can give us the chance to do what so many other institutions have decided they cannot.
But it is the choices you have made and the judgement you have displayed in these first critical days that are allowing us to stay together.
As the leader of one of the few major universities in the country offering some in-person instruction, I do not exaggerate when I tell you the world is watching us. And with each day, more eyes are on us and more people are asking “Can Illinois really do this?”
Make no mistake. They are not watching because they want to see us fail.
They are watching because with each day you are giving everyone a growing sense of hope. They are holding a collective breath, and they want us to succeed.
This week you have given them every reason to put their faith in the students, faculty and staff of Illinois.
Thank you. And please, do not let up now.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                August 27, 2020 4:01 PM

        Faculty, Staff and Students,
We are nearing the end of our first week of on-campus COVID-19 saliva testing, and we have received feedback about the process and ways it could be improved. Please know that we are listening to your feedback, and we appreciate your patience and understanding as we navigate a complicated process that has never been done.
Based on your feedback, we are implementing the following changes to the current process:
For everyone who must participate in the on-campus testing program, you must be tested and receive negative results at least every four days. 
You will be in compliance and have Access Granted status for building entry from the time you receive your negative test results until 11:59 on the fourth day after you take the test. 
For example, if you test Monday, you will receive Access Granted status (in both the Safer Illinois app and the Boarding Pass options) from the time you receive a negative result until 11:59 p.m. on Friday of the same week.

We are continuing to encourage everyone to use these two-day testing schedules to make it an easy part of a weekly routine:
Monday and Thursday
Tuesday and Friday
Wednesday and Saturday
Wednesday and Sunday

If you are a student, we highly encourage you to choose one of the weekend schedules (Wednesday and Saturday or Wednesday and Sunday) to take advantage of shorter lines when the university is less populated. We are increasing capacity at testing sites for the weekends for your convenience.
We are stopping all reminder emails immediately. The intention was to give more guidance, but we understand they have unintentionally led to more confusion. 
If you already have a two-day testing schedule that works for you, please continue to use it.
If you have requested a different testing schedule than the one you originally received, please feel free to begin using it now.
If you have not been assigned a testing schedule, please pick one of the two-day testing schedules above that works for you.
Please understand that test results may require up to 48 hours.
One important note about Labor Day: You will need to test on Thursday, Friday, Saturday or Sunday to ensure compliance when regular operations resume Tuesday. Some testing sites will be open on Labor Day as well.
We are also working on a tool to check which times and locations at each testing location are least busy, so you can make the best decision about where and when to test. We will provide more information just as soon as we are able.
Please continue to check the On-Campus Testing COVID-19 Testing page on the university’s COVID-19 website as we continue to add to the FAQ section. Thank you for your diligence and continued patience as we navigate this together. If you have additional questions about this process or testing schedules, please email covid-19@illinois.edu. If you have questions about testing results or quarantine or isolation, please email covidwellness@illinois.edu.

        Dear campus community member,
The Urbana campus will test its emergency notification system at 10:05 a.m. on Tuesday, Sept. 1.
All campus community members are encouraged to sign up for Illini-Alert text messages to receive prompt notification of campus emergencies. You can do so by visiting http://emergency.illinois.edu. Contact information for friends and relatives may be added at http://go.illinois.edu/illinialertmyfamily. Anyone else can sign up by texting ""IlliniAlert"" to 226787.
The test of the Illini-Alert system will use all of the communication capabilities of the emergency notification system:
Email messages will be sent to all active faculty and staff members and students with campus email addresses.
Text messages will be sent to those people who have registered their cellphone numbers.  
The Emergency Web Alert System will trigger a pop-up box on all campus websites.
A message will appear on the Illini-Alert Facebook account (http://www.facebook.com/illinialert).
A message will be sent to the Illini-Alert Twitter account (http://twitter.com/illinialert).
A message will appear on all digital signs connected to the Illini-Alert system.
The test does not require any response; evaluators will be able to monitor the speed and distribution rates of the messaging. Thank you for your cooperation.

        Dear Students,
As you know by now, when we start the semester on Monday, we will be one of an increasingly small number of universities to be doing so with any significant amount of in-person instruction. At the end of this message you'll find a final list of some important actions and preparations you’ll need to be sure you’ve completed.
Our ability to come together this way is built on the foundation of our innovative on-campus COVID-19 saliva-based testing program. What will determine if we stay together in-person through the semester is whether we all can make the right personal choices and exercise the very best judgement in these critical first few weeks of the semester.
Our testing can quickly detect the virus. This comprehensive testing allows for quick quarantine, public health contact tracing and rapid delivery of any necessary medical care. But the only way we can prevent it from spreading in the first place is by wearing face coverings, washing our hands, practicing social distancing and avoiding crowds and situations that we know put many people at risk of exposure and put all of us at risk of having to return to fully remote operations as we did in the spring.
If we ALL commit to this very hard work, our chances of remaining together throughout the semester get better. In the last week alone, we’ve seen several institutions revert quickly away from on-campus operations. Although we believe our testing capability better positions us, we know how quickly things can change.
We have invented a new kind of test, we’ve launched what is to our knowledge the most comprehensive COVID-19 testing program in the country, we’ve built the Safer Illinois app specifically for this cause and we’ve reimagined and redesigned almost every course, classroom and meeting space.
In short, we’ve given ourselves the chance to succeed at something that has never been attempted before.
We’ve got an opportunity many others in the country do not. It is up to all of us – together – to make it a reality.
These next two or three weeks will define how we move forward from here.
We have said this before and we say it again now.
We believe in you. We believe in your strength of character, your values and in your commitment to the community that surrounds us.
And we believe the choices you make in these next days will show the world what is possible when Illinois students come together when it matters most.

Important Information and Final Preparations for Monday
Make sure you have completed your required on-campus COVID-19 test and have your results in time before you try to attend an in-person class or enter any university building.
You can find a list of testing sites and hours here. Several are open Saturday and Sunday.
Please refrain from eating, drinking, tooth brushing, mouth washing, gum chewing and tobacco use for one hour before your test.
You will not be able to access classrooms or university buildings this semester if you are not completing two tests each week, and you could face action through the student discipline process. If you have not received information about a testing schedule yet, you should plan to test every four days.

Make sure you are ready to show your building entry status. You’ll need to make sure you’ve got a current version of the Safer Illinois app or bookmark the COVID-19 Boarding Pass page on your phone. The COVID-19 Boarding Pass will not be active for use until Monday, Aug. 24.
Make sure your technology and Internet access are going to meet your needs this fall. This Technology Services guide is a great place to start. Whether you are studying remotely or coming to campus, if you do not have access to a functional computer or reliable Internet connectivity in your location, please contact the Student Assistance Center at 217-333-0050 or helpdean@illinois.edu.
Update your fall address information in Self-Service. You are required to do this no matter where you will be studying this semester. Instructions are here if you need them.
Pick up your PPE kit at the Illini Union in the I-Rooms if you haven’t done so already.
Complete your required Division of Research Safety COVID-19 online training.
Join the thousands who have taken the Illinois Community Pledge.
Make sure you are aware of the special new COVID-19 ordinances and rules Champaign and Urbana have put in place. These include limits on gathering sizes, requires all campus area bars and restaurants to serve customers in outdoor areas only through Labor Day (9/7), prohibits anyone under 21 from entering bars after 9 p.m. and public face-covering requirements. You can find the Champaign Emergency Orders here."

                August 21, 2020 10:17 AM

        “What makes you think you can open the semester with in-person classes?”
That is the question we are all hearing this week as we see a number of other universities change course to move fully online.
It’s because we have our innovative new saliva-based test and the infrastructure to deploy that testing with the frequency and scale that we have put in place. This comprehensive testing allows for quick quarantine, public health contact tracing and rapid delivery of any necessary medical care.
This makes all of the difference – for our university and for the members of the community in which we all live, work and learn.
On Monday, we conducted about 10,000 tests. To put that in a national context, about 1.3 percent of all COVID-19 tests performed in the nation on that day were processed right here on campus.  
As our testing has accelerated this week, we have seen an increase in daily positive cases that is well within the expectations of our state and local public health officials and local hospitals. But the more important number to watch is our very low daily positivity rate. This is the percentage of people who test positive out of those who have been tested. This is a critical measure because it tells us how widespread the infection is here in our community and whether our levels of testing are keeping up with levels of disease transmission.
We have conducted more than 60,000 tests since we began the program in July. During this time we watched our daily positivity rate drop from about 1.5% to below 0.2%. The positivity rate this week has ranged between 0.3 and 0.5 percent. These rates are several times lower than the corresponding positivity rate for our Restore Illinois region and ten times below the maximum levels that the World Health Organization recommends. Starting next week, our daily test results will be posted on the COVID-19 website.
Data models developed by our faculty this summer predicted a few hundred new cases as people return to campus over the first few weeks of the semester with cases dropping off after that and a low daily positivity rate throughout. The actual results of this first week are very, very close to these predictions. We have been sharing these models with state and local health officials, our local city leaders and our community hospitals who have used the data in their own planning and preparations for these first weeks of the semester.
However, those same models very clearly show that our collective actions during these first two weeks will determine what the rest of our semester will look like. Testing alone will not contain the spread of the virus.
What will determine if we stay together in-person is whether we all can make the personal choices and exercise the very best judgement in these critical early days. Our testing can detect the virus quickly. But the only way we can prevent it from spreading in the first place is by wearing face coverings, washing our hands, practicing social distancing and avoiding crowds and situations that we know put many people at risk of exposure and put all of us at risk of having to return to fully remote operations as we did in the spring.
These next 10 or 15 days will define how we move forward from here.
It is our innovative spirit and the creativity of our own researchers that have given us this test that gives us a chance to overcome the challenges that have forced many other universities to move fully online.
But, in the end, it is the commitment and character of our students, faculty and staff to take hard, but necessary actions, and to exercise discipline and good judgement that will carry us forward.
We can do this. But we must do it together.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                August 20, 2020 10:32 PM

        Dear Students,
The cities of Champaign and Urbana recently issued emergency orders regarding the use of face coverings, parties, and social gatherings.
The new Emergency Orders were put into place to continue to promote community health and safety amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
The Emergency Orders, effective immediately, require:
Individuals over the age of two and able to medically tolerate a face mask, to cover their nose and mouth with a face covering when in public and unable to maintain at least a six-foot social distance from others.
This applies to indoor spaces, like retail stores, and outdoor spaces when an individual cannot maintain a minimum six-foot distance from others.

Social distancing requirements on properties in the Campus Area (including apartments, houses, and adjacent property like yards, parking lots, and common areas) and multifamily residential structures throughout Champaign and Urbana (including residential units, common areas, yards, and parking lots).
View Campus Area maps for the City of Champaign and City of Urbana.
In both the Campus Area and multifamily residential structures in the Champaign-Urbana community, individuals at parties or gatherings must abide by social distancing requirements, including the use of face coverings and limit parties and gatherings to a maximum of ten people (plus the host and the host’s immediate family or others legally permitted to reside in the property).

Party hosts and attendees violating an Emergency Order may be cited for a City Ordinance violation and fined up to $750 per violation day. These Orders also apply to parties or gatherings on public property, unless otherwise permitted by other emergency or executive orders or the law.
Hosts should be prepared to prove legal possession, whether by reason of ownership or lease, over the premises where a Party or Gathering occurs. A copy of your lease or house and corps roster will satisfy this requirement.

Patrons of Urbana bars or restaurants must be seated, wear masks when they aren’t eating or drinking, and maintain social distancing of at least a six (6) feet that separates two or more individuals from each other.
Patrons under the age of 21 are prohibited from being inside Urbana bars after 9 p.m.
In an effort to comply with these Emergency Orders, the Illini Union has removed all seating from the lower level and will direct patrons to eat outside of the building. In addition, seating in the courtyard will be reserved for studying only until further notice.
It is suggested that whenever possible, people choose an outdoor location to partake of food and drink.
To read the full text of the Emergency Orders, please visit the City of Champaign champaignil.gov/covid-19 and City of Urbana urbanaillinois.us/COVID-19 websites.
If you have questions regarding the City of Champaign’s Emergency Orders, please contact the City of Champaign City Manager's Office at 403-8710 or email citymanagersoffice@champaignil.gov. For questions regarding the City of Urbana Emergency Orders, please visit urbanaillinois.us/citizens-voice.

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
As we begin this Fall 2020 semester, we want to remind you to participate in our COVID-19 on-campus testing program as soon as you arrive on campus or in Champaign County. If you are currently living here, we hope you will begin now. 
We have been working closely with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District since this pandemic began, and we have plans and processes in place to maximize the safety of everyone as we navigate the positive cases that we anticipate as we repopulate campus. I am writing this message to explain our process for what happens if you ever receive a positive COVID-19 test result, so you will have a clear understanding of the support available to you.
Student process for positive COVID-19 case
Students will be notified of results from an on-campus test via email through the McKinley Patient Health Portal. It is critically important that you check your university email account daily and access your results in the McKinley Patient Health Portal upon receiving notification of test result availability. (Safer Illinois app users can also see results through the app.)
You will be contacted within 24 hours by the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (using phone number 312-777-1999) to provide specific isolation guidance and to collect information for contact tracing. I encourage you to add this number in your phone as a contact.
If you test positive, please go to your local place of residence (residence hall room, apartment, etc.) and self-isolate, limiting your contact with others immediately. When CUPHD contacts you, they will coordinate with you and university staff to find a place where you will isolate. If you would like to go to your permanent residence to isolate, you will work with CUPHD to determine whether it is safe for you to do so.
Isolation as directed by CUPHD is mandatory for students. If you choose not to follow this guidance, you could be subject to student discipline.
You should not leave your residence/isolation location after receiving a positive test result until you are notified you can do so by CUPHD.
If you receive a positive test, you will need to email your instructors and let them know you will be absent from class. You do not need to share any specific health information with them.
If you are in remote courses, you may continue to attend class online if you are able.
You can use the OSF On Call program that provides information, support and guidance at no cost to you.
The Student Assistance Center (217-333-0050; helpdean@illinois.edu) is also available to help you understand university policies and procedures and connect you with resources, whether related to COVID-19 or other challenges that you may be experiencing.
Employee process for positive COVID-19 case
Employees will be notified of results from an on-campus test via email through the McKinley Patient Health Portal. It is critically important that you check your university email account daily and access your results in the McKinley Patient Health Portal upon receiving notification of test result availability. (Safer Illinois app users can also see results through the app.)
If you test positive, you should avoid contact with others immediately. You will be contacted within 24 hours by the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (using phone number 312-777-1999) to provide specific isolation guidance and to collect information for contact tracing. I encourage you to add this number in your phone as a contact.
Isolation as directed by CUPHD is mandatory for employees. If you choose not to follow this guidance, you could be subject to discipline through Illinois Human Resources.
If you test positive, you will be provided information about where to isolate.
You should not leave your home/isolation location after receiving a positive test result until you are cleared by CUPHD.
Employees who receive a positive test are required to notify Illinois Human Resources by calling 217-300-9005. Illinois Human Resources will provide information about paid leave options, as well as collect information that will help ensure we take any necessary cleaning or sanitation steps.
You must inform your unit of your absence, but you do not need to share specific health information. IHR will only provide information necessary to take any appropriate safety actions.
If you are doing remote work, you may continue to work if you are able.
You can use the OSF On Call program that provides information, support and guidance at no cost to you.
Quarantine & stay-at-home requirements for students and employees
Quarantine helps prevent the spread of disease by separating and restricting the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease. Quarantine is used to keep someone who might have been exposed to COVID-19 away from others to reduce the potential risk of transmission. Quarantine is different than isolation, which is used when someone has tested positive for COVID-19.
As this time, these are the scenarios in which quarantine will be required:
If you have been identified by CUPHD as someone who has been exposed to a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, you will receive a call from CUPHD (using phone number 312-777-1999). This process is known as contact tracing. You will then be required to quarantine as instructed by CUPHD.
If you receive an exposure notification through the Safer Illinois app, you should quarantine and get a COVID-19 test on the fourth day after the exposure. Read more about exposure notifications on the Safer Illinois website.
New travel guidance has been issued from the Centers for Disease Control, Illinois Department of Public Health and the Champaign Urbana Public Health District recommending a 14-day stay at home order that is similar to, but not quite as restrictive as quarantine. This post-travel stay at home requirement applies to travel to areas of higher risk, both international and U.S. hot spots.
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has one of the most innovative on-campus COVID-19 testing programs in the country. We have worked with local public health officials and medical providers to ensure that any predicted increase in positive results that comes with this unmatched level of testing and notification will be within the Restore Illinois guidelines while maximizing the health of all members of our community.
This testing program gives us a unique safeguard to undertake the hybrid education model we begin next week. Combined with all of the safety measures recommended by public health officials, we have a system of protocols and tools that is not available to any other university in the country at this time. We have the opportunity to come together this fall in ways that others do not. But it will require all of us taking these actions and following the testing and response processes we have established to safely stay together for the semester.
Sincerely,Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                August 18, 2020 2:02 PM

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
As you prepare for the first day of instruction, I’m writing to share some important information that you need to know about entering buildings for the Fall 2020 semester. In order to maximize the safety of our entire community, we will be limiting access to facilities to individuals who are in compliance with safety requirements. This is an important step of our safety planning, and I want to be sure you know what to expect before the first week of classes.
Buildings with in-person classes
The university plans to place a specially trained employee called a Wellness Support Associate (WSA) inside one or two entrances to many facilities where in-person classes are being held. In those facilities, all other doors and entrances will be locked.
At each WSA-staffed entrance, any individual (faculty, staff or students) who wishes to enter must show WSAs their building entry status. This status shows that an individual is up-to-date for on-campus testing, does not have a positive COVID-19 test and has not been instructed by the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District to quarantine or isolate for any reason.
Individuals can view their status and display it to WSAs by choosing one of the following options:
Safer Illinois app
COVID-19 Boarding Pass (this can be used by showing a webpage or printing a physical pass)
Please note that the Access Granted/Access Denied mechanisms will not be active for use until Aug. 21, and in-person checks for building status will not begin until Aug. 24. Beginning on Monday, individuals should wait their turn to display their Access Granted status to the WSA in a line. Everyone should plan to arrive early, wear a face covering and practice social distancing (at least six feet away from the person in front of and behind you) in order to ensure a smooth process.
All students, faculty and staff start with their building access status set to Access Denied. This will be the case whether you choose to use the app or a boarding pass option. In order to initially have your status changed to Access Granted, you must have a negative COVID-19 test.
I encourage everyone to begin on-campus testing as soon as they return to the campus community, at least two days before you expect to enter an on-campus facility. Individuals must continue to participate in the on-campus testing program to retain Access Granted status. Click here for more information about the COVID-19 testing program.
Other facilities
Other university facilities may also check building entry status for individuals who plan to work on-campus. There may also be different mechanisms to check for building entry status in place at non-instructional facilities. Students will receive more information about building entrance status as it relates to residence halls, dining halls and other student services. Units in non-instructional buildings should clearly communicate to their employees about the building access protocols they will use. 
You can find more information about building access, including a list of FAQs, on the university’s COVID-19 website. The website is updated frequently, and I encourage you to review it often in the coming weeks.
Thank you for your patience as we figure out how to resolve the operational challenges of a COVID-19 semester together. I sincerely appreciate your understanding as we continue to make decisions and take actions to maximize the safety of our students, faculty, staff and the community in which we live and work.
I know every answer we provide seems to lead to another question. And, all-too-often, the answers will change as new information becomes available. This is one of the greatest frustrations of this pandemic. We’ll continue to tell you what we know as soon as we can.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

I am delighted to announce the second cohort for the system-wide Public Voices Fellowship. The national Public Voices Fellowship is a unique opportunity led by The OpEd Project and designed for tenure-system faculty. The program is part of a national initiative to help faculty amplify their expertise in ways that can contribute to public conversations about pressing issues. The 20 faculty in this second cohort will attend four sessions held during the 2020-21 academic year and will be paired with a journalism mentor that provides one-on-one editing and coaching, with the goal of publishing two op-ed pieces during the program.
We received more than 40 nominations from across our three universities for the program and the selection process was very competitive. Diversity of background and experiences as well as university representation were factors in the selection process.

                August 12, 2020 3:09 PM

        To Members of the Campus Community,
All on-campus COVID-19 testing sites will be closed on Thursday, Aug. 13 and Friday, Aug. 14 to add some essential new equipment and complete the training of new staff that have joined our team.
These are part of our final preparations to scale up our testing operations to accommodate full implementation of twice-weekly testing of all students, faculty and staff. This equipment and personnel will offer greater redundancy, reliability and help ensure test results will be processed and posted as quickly as possible as we open the semester.
Due to the closures, the faculty and staff testing requirement will be waived this week. However, if you were planning on testing Thursday or Friday and want to complete a test this week, you can visit one of the sites that will be open this weekend.
The sites at Washington Park, NCSA and in Illini Union 314 will be open Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. – 3 p.m. You can find more detailed information about where to find these sites and maps here. All testing sites will be reopen for their regular hours on Monday, Aug. 17.
Thank you to those who have already begun testing regularly. Your participation has helped us to scale up our process very quickly since it launched in July. And, of course, the rapid results of this Illinois test have given all of us on campus another tool to monitor our own health and provided our public health officials important information about the overall health of our local community.
Sincerely,COVID-19 Executive Steering Committee on Return to On-Campus Operations"

                August 12, 2020 1:02 PM

        Dear Students,
We are now within two weeks of the opening of the semester. It is going to be very different until the pandemic is past us, so we are asking you to add a few very important COVID-19-related items to your list of final preparations in these coming days. There are a number of new requirements and expectations in place and we want you to understand them and be ready to begin your year as smoothly as possible under these very, very unusual circumstances.
For All Students
Whether you will be physically coming to campus or you will be studying remotely, here are some things we ask you to do as soon as possible.
Update your fall address information in Self-Service by Aug. 17. You are required to do this no matter where you will be studying this semester. Instructions are here if you need them.
Complete your required Division of Research Safety COVID-19 online training by Aug. 24.
Check your fall schedule again in Course Explorer to make sure there are no changes or conflicts.
Make sure your technology and Internet access are going to meet your needs this fall. This Technology Services guide is a great place to start.
Whether you are studying remotely or coming to campus, if you do not have access to a functional computer or reliable Internet connectivity in your location, please contact the Student Assistance Center at 217-333-0050 or helpdean@illinois.edu. The Center can work with you to make sure you have access to the technology you need.
Check your university email account often. Things can change quickly these days and your university email address is the fastest way we have to reach you. And remember, you can always find the latest updates related to the pandemic at covid19.illinois.edu.
Help your family stay informed as well by signing them up for parent and family communications at go.illinois.edu/connectme.
For Students Coming to Campus and into our Local Community
For those of you who will be joining the Urbana-Champaign community this semester, we ask you to take some additional steps before you leave home and when you arrive here.
As soon as you physically arrive, you must begin taking your free, required campus COVID-19 tests twice a week. Whether you are living in University Housing or a private residence, you should start testing the day you arrive here.
Testing sites are open now, and as soon as you have your i-card, you can begin testing. Just make sure you refrain from eating, drinking, tooth brushing, mouth washing, gum chewing and tobacco use for 30 minutes before your test. See the available testing locations here.
You will not be able to access classrooms or university buildings this semester if you are not completing two tests each week, and you could face action through the student discipline process.  
Watch for information this week about downloading the Safer Illinois app. This app will display your building entry status and allow easier access to testing results. 

In the days before you leave home, take extra precautions to minimize your possible exposure to the virus and to reduce the risk of the spread of the virus to friends, classmates, professors, staff and members of our community.
If you are not feeling well, please stay home and quarantine yourself. If you believe that delaying your return for this reason will cause problems with your classes or housing or registration, please contact the Student Assistance Center (217-333-0050, helpdean@illinois.edu). We’ll work with you to figure it all out. Making sure you are safe and healthy is our first priority.
Practice social distancing all of the time – in public and in private.
Wear your mask or face covering if you cannot keep a safe distance from others.
Avoid large public gatherings, social events and crowded spaces such as bars and restaurants.
If COVID-19 testing is available to you where you live, you should consider getting tested shortly before you come to campus so you can be sure that you are COVID-19 negative before you decide to travel. This is not required, but if it is an option available to you, it is another safeguard you can take.

However you will be participating this semester – in-person or remotely – we know COVID-19 is going to bring with it additional challenges.
Face coverings, twice weekly COVID-19 tests, many more online classes and staying six feet away from your friends and classmates – these things are not typical at Illinois and we know how much we are asking of you. But these are the things we must do in order to look after one another’s well-being as we come together this semester. And if we ALL commit to this very hard work, our chances of remaining together throughout the semester get better.
We believe in you. We believe in your strength of character, your values and in your commitment to the community. And we know you will do your part to help us make sure we navigate the uncertainty and manage the challenges of this pandemic.
Thank you for taking care of one another this semester.

                August 11, 2020 3:02 PM

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff, 
Last Monday’s massmail about Fall 2020 requirements answered many questions about the fall semester. One of the most significant requirements during this semester will be twice-weekly COVID-19 tests for all students on or near campus, and for all staff and faculty who have a need to be on-campus for any reason and for any length of time. To the best of our knowledge, the ability to offer this level of access to free, rapid COVID-19 tests is unmatched in the country right now. It is a critical component in our ability to resume our modified in-person instruction.
Faculty and staff were required to begin their regular testing on Monday, Aug. 10 or as soon as they arrive on campus after that date. Students will be required to begin testing on Sunday, Aug. 16 or as soon as they arrive on campus after that date.
The SHIELD: Target, Test, Tell team has determined that, in order to reduce the chance of exposure during this initial period when a larger volume of people are returning to campus at once, students, faculty and staff are required to have completed a test and received a negative result before being allowed to access university classrooms, buildings and facilities.
Testing sites are now open. If you have a valid i-card, we encourage you to start taking advantage of the availability of this free, rapid testing right now. We want you to start testing as soon as you are on campus or back in our local community. Just make sure you refrain from eating, drinking, tooth brushing, mouth washing, gum chewing and tobacco use for 30 minutes before your test. See the available testing locations here.
We know this testing requirement brings with it another set of questions for our university community. We want to give you answers to some of the most frequent ones we are hearing.
How will my weekly testing schedule be determined and when will I get it?In the next few days, you will receive an email invitation with a link to complete an individualized, confidential survey that will help determine the two days that best match your weekly schedule and routine. The message will have the subject line “Your COVID-19 Survey and Testing Schedule,” and it will be sent from covidwellness@illinois.edu.The SHIELD team will use your answers to determine the test days that best match your needs and that give you the most current results when your potential exposure to the virus is highest. You should expect to receive a separate email with your testing schedule before the semester begins.A new survey will be sent to everyone the first week of every month, allowing your schedule to change as you adjust your activities throughout the semester.When you receive the survey, you will also be asked if you will share your answers with a group of researchers working with the SHIELD: Target, Test, Tell team. Sharing your information confidentially will assist our study on COVID-19 risk, spread and management. If you do not wish to consent to participate in the research component, your survey response will be used only to set your testing schedule.
What if I don’t complete the survey?Your weekly testing schedule will be assigned randomly. The survey is the best way to make sure your testing schedule is built around your daily life and campus engagement and activities.
I don’t have my scheduled days yet. When should I go test?Until you have received your individualized testing schedule, you can test twice a week on one of the following combination of days: Monday/Thursday, Tuesday/Friday, Wednesday/Saturday, Thursday/Sunday. The goal is to test at least every four days.
What if I can’t go on my scheduled day for some reason?You must do your best to keep to your schedule. This offers all of us the greatest level of protection and the most accurate data to monitor and slow any spread of the virus in our community.
Will I have to go to a specific site or have an appointment?You can take your test at any site you choose at any time during normal operating hours on your scheduled testing days. You will receive emailed reminders on days when you are scheduled.
What happens if I miss one of my scheduled testing days?You will receive an initial email reminder that you have missed a scheduled test. Your access to campus classrooms, buildings or facilities may be removed. You must visit one of our testing sites, and you must resume your assigned testing schedule at the first opportunity, even if this means you take a test on consecutive days. Failure to complete your required testing could also result in action through the applicable student or employee discipline process.
Can I still come on campus if I’ve missed one of my scheduled tests?Your access to campus classrooms, buildings or facilities may be removed. You must visit one of our testing sites, and you must resume your assigned testing schedule at the first opportunity, even if this means you then must take a test on consecutive days.  
How do I restore my access to enter university facilities and buildings if I have missed my test?If you have had your access restricted because you have missed a test, during the first few weeks of the semester, you will need to get a COVID-19 test as soon as possible. With a negative test result, your access will be restored. Depending upon how soon you get tested, it could take up to 48 hours for access to be restored.
I live in University Housing. Will I be able to enter my residence hall if I miss one of my tests?Yes. But that is the only building you will be able to enter until you have checked in at a testing site and until you have received a negative test result. If you have a current University Housing contract, you will always be able to enter your residence hall.
What if I miss class because I missed my scheduled test date?This would be considered an absence and our regular academic policies and practices would apply. Your course syllabus will explain how absences are addressed. In addition to the possible academic penalties, failure to complete your required testing could also result in action through the student discipline process.  
I am living on campus or in the local community, but all my classes are online. Do I still have to get tested twice a week?Yes. If you are living on-campus or in the community you will need to test twice a week to remain in good academic standing, even if you are taking a fully online schedule. If you live here you must test. If you come to campus for any reason, you must test.  
Can I get my weekly scheduled days changed? If you have questions about your testing schedule or about any of the testing process, please email our COVID Wellness Answer Center at covidwellness@illinois.edu. You should also contact the COVID Wellness Answer Center if you do not receive your survey invitation by Aug. 12.
The Illinois test for COVID-19 is unique, and it is foundational to our efforts to resume in-person instruction and on-campus operations this year. And while the process is quick and easy with conveniently located testing sites, we know there is nothing normal about asking you to test twice a week. But until the pandemic is behind us, physically coming together and remaining together will require each of us to take new and unfamiliar actions.
When all of us commit to wearing face coverings, washing our hands often, practicing social distancing and getting tested regularly, we aren’t just protecting ourselves, we are looking out for our friends, our coworkers and the members of the community in which we all live.
Please watch for your survey invitation next week and thank you for making your COVID-19 test part of your weekly routine.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                August 4, 2020 8:16 AM

        Dear Students,
All students enrolled for the Fall 2020 semester are required to provide their fall address information by August 17. Maintaining an updated address enables campus health and wellness units to communicate proper protocols to students that will help us all maintain a safe and healthy campus environment during the pandemic. This requirement, along with a number of others, was shared in this massmail on Monday, Aug. 3.
ACTION: To input this information in Self-Service:
In Self-Service, select “University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.”
Log in using your NetID and Password.
In the Main Menu, select “Personal Information.”
In the Personal Information menu, select “Addresses & Phones.”
In the dropdown for “Type of Address to Insert,” select “Student Location” then click “Submit.”
Use August 1, 2020 as the “Valid From This Date,” and December 31, 2020 for the “Until This Date” field.
Complete the Address Lines 1-3 to the best of your ability. Address Line 1 is a required field that should include your location street name and number. If you don’t know a specific apartment number, for example, you can leave Address Lines 2 and/or 3 blank.
Input the City of your location and select the appropriate State or Province from the drop-down. The ZIP or Postal Code and County fields will populate automatically based on City and State or Province. If your location is international, not in the U.S. or Canada, you can enter your nation first, then please provide a complete postal address including street, city and postal code where applicable.
Once you have completed the remaining fields to the best of your ability (phone information is not required), click “Submit.”
You can then exit Self-Service by clicking “EXIT” in the upper-right corner.
BACKGROUND:  All students must access Self-Service to input this information no later than August 17 at 11:59 p.m. CDT. In order to ensure the health and safety of our campus, COVID-19 testing and participation in contact tracing is mandatory for all local students. Having accurate information to know who is in the local community is thus essential. Release of student information is restricted based on the criteria of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974.
This action is required of all students who are enrolled for the Fall 2020 semester; it is separate from any previously entered address data. Failure to take action by the deadline or inputting false or intentionally inaccurate information will result in referral to the Office of Student Conflict Resolution for disciplinary or other corrective action. Since students who are on campus need to be able to utilize important health and wellness units, all students with a local fall address will be assessed the Health Service Fee and will have access to McKinley Health Center and the Counseling Center. Students for whom the minimum required information is missing or incomplete will be considered to be local.
Questions regarding the entry process should be directed to Registration Services. If you have questions about the use of this information, please contact the Provost’s office.
We appreciate your prompt attention to this important matter.

Information is available on the COVID-19 website for employees working in university facilities and for employees working remotely.Cleaning – Facilities & Services continues to maintain robust cleaning and sanitizing procedures. There will also be sanitation stations across campus to facilitate frequent hand washing and the use of hand sanitizer.
COVID Wellness Team – The university will be encouraging (and, when necessary, enforcing) COVID-19 guidelines in a number of ways, including creating a new COVID Wellness team. This team will include student Wellness Ambassadors, a COVID Wellness Answer Center to answer questions and Wellness Support Associates who will check for compliance at the entrances of buildings and classrooms. This team will be in place by Monday, Aug. 24, the first day of instruction for the Fall 2020 semester.
I want to confirm that we will continue to engage with the labor unions that represent our employees to discuss the impact of these plans.  
I sincerely appreciate your patience and understanding as we continue to make decisions and take actions to maximize the safety of our students, faculty, staff and greater community.
I know how hard this has been for every single one of you reading this, and I am so proud to be part of a university where so many people make the well-being of others their top priority.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                July 31, 2020 8:09 AM

        Dear Students,
Thanks to the hard work of units across campus and to your patience and cooperation, we are pleased to share that the Fall 2020 Class Schedule is now live in Course Explorer.
We encourage you to review your fall class schedule now and to continue to do so regularly, as minor modifications can be expected until the start of classes. When you check your updated fall schedule, you should expect to see that some of your courses have moved online or to hybrid delivery. You may also see some location changes for courses that will continue to meet in person. If you are comfortable with your schedule, there is no need to act. When considering changes, please be aware that access to in-person courses is limited. If you need to make changes, you may do so beginning with the date and time of your revised Fall 2020 Time Ticket. Information on the time ticket process, including approximate start dates assigned by group, can be found on the Office of the Registrar’s website.
Again, it is important to continue to check your schedule periodically throughout the month of August since minor modifications may still be made. Continue to carefully read any messages from your academic advisor, departmental, and/or college offices, and please connect with your advisor regarding any questions you have about your fall schedule.
Thanks again for your continued flexibility and understanding.
Sincerely,
Meghan HazenRegistrar"

                July 27, 2020 9:02 AM

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
Recent events have once again underscored the critical need for universities across our nation to prioritize research focused on systemic racial inequities that exist not only in our communities but in higher education itself. 
Systemic racism and generationally embedded racial disparity are two of the greatest challenges facing our society. It is time to focus the vast and unmatched intellectual and scholarly talent of this 21st century land-grant university on finding new solutions to these persistent and destructive issues. It is time for this university to issue this new and unequivocal Call to Action to address these embedded and persisting disparities at every level with our full and comprehensive, transdisciplinary excellence. And we must do so with the same urgency, creativity and purpose we have seen in response to the COVID-19 crisis.  
In the coming days and weeks, we will be introducing a series of actions, investments, programs and policy reform efforts designed to quickly and permanently transform the way our own university supports, prioritizes and recognizes the research of scholars working on issues of systemic racism in the United States.
Led by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, this Call to Action initiative will lay out a framework for how we make this transformation and establish a series of working groups charged with taking concrete steps forward to dismantle systemic racism and injustice that are both measurable and accountable by the end of the coming academic year.
In a recent essay relaying my perspectives on the devastating impacts of systemic racism I made the statement that we must be unapologetically impatient in seeking change. So I want to be clear that this is not another call to talk. It is very specifically a call to act in ways that will be comprehensive, measurable, strategic, thoughtful, transparent and rapid.
And the core of everything we do through this Call to Action this year will be built on the foundation of scholarly rigor and research prominence that are the Illinois hallmarks. There is a critical need for high quality, high integrity scholarship that provides foundations to intervene in institutionalized disparities, structures of violence, and over-criminalization to fundamentally address the root of issues that continue to create inequality, inequity and lost opportunities for too many in our society.
So, I am excited to announce that the inaugural component in the Call to Action is the Chancellor’s Research Program to Address Racism and Social Injustice.
Managed by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in collaboration with the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation, the new program will invest $2 million annually to support competitively awarded tenure/tenure-track faculty grants, an annual symposium of funded projects and an ongoing lecture series. The first call for research proposals and inaugural awards will be coming early in the fall semester.
The inaugural call for proposals will focus on these three areas:
Systemic racism and social justice
Law enforcement and criminal justice reform
Disparities in health and health care
This initiative is just the first step as we seek to transform the way our own university supports, prioritizes, and recognizes the research of scholars working on issues of systemic racism in the United States. There are many more to come in the days and weeks ahead.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Students,
The Massmail from June 23, 2020 detailed planned activities around fall schedule modifications and the updated registration process. Following this plan, the Office of the Registrar has reviewed and compiled departmental course revision submissions. Based on the compilation of these submissions:
The majority of revisions to classes involve delivery mode, primarily moving sections online along with some moves to hybrid (mix of in-person and online) delivery. You should expect your revised schedule to include at least some online courses.
The meeting location for in-person courses may have changed.
Although time conflicts are unlikely, you should still review meeting dates and times carefully.
Time tickets were issued July 14. Your time ticket represents the earliest date and time at which you can revise your fall class schedule if you wish in Self-Service. Course Explorer will return to live mode July 31. Please note the information provided on the Registrar’s site about how to recognize if a class is online.
You may have already heard from your home academic unit or perhaps even from instructors of courses in which you are currently enrolled updating you on their plans. If you are seeking clarification on any element of those messages, you are welcome to respond directly to the sender or, if applicable, as detailed in the message text for further guidance. For more general questions about your fall schedule, please contact your academic advisor. Graduate students who have additional questions about their schedules should reach out to their department and/or their advisor.
Thank you for your continued patience and understanding.

          To our students, faculty and staff:
We are pleased to inform you that the federal government on Tuesday rescinded the recent directive from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that placed new restrictions on visas for international students.
The rule had threatened to bar international students who attend universities that will offer only online instruction in response to the pandemic from being in the country. We believed the new rule to be unnecessary, disruptive and harmful to international students and to U.S. higher education in general and had worked to support several legal challenges. That included a lawsuit filed by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and another led by the Illinois Attorney General and 17 other states’ attorneys general, both supported with legal filings by the U of I System and its three universities.
We are gratified to deliver today’s good news, and vow continued support of our international students and their access to the world-class education and opportunities provided by our universities.

          Dear students, faculty and staff:
Today we’re writing to tell you that the University of Illinois System and its three universities are actively participating in a new legal effort by Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and 17 other attorneys general around the country to challenge the recent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) restrictions on visas for international students.
Attorney General Raoul and his colleagues on Monday filed a lawsuit opposing what they call the federal government’s “cruel, abrupt, and unlawful action.”
The U of I System and its universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield agree with Attorney General Raoul and his colleagues that new ICE restrictions forcing international students whose schools offer online-only instruction to either leave the country or transfer to other schools are disruptive and unnecessary. Included as part of that litigation is a declaration issued on behalf of the system and our universities. We plan a hybrid instruction model that blends in-person and online instruction, but we nonetheless believe the restrictions will be harmful to students elsewhere and to higher education in general.
We also announced on Friday our plans to join litigation filed by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that challenges the new restrictions. We are pleased to update you and tell you that our amicus brief in support of that case was filed on Sunday.
We will continue to do all we can to support our international students and those around the country during this difficult time.

                July 10, 2020 5:18 PM

          Dear students, faculty and staff:
We are writing to inform you that the University of Illinois System and its constituent universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield are working aggressively to legally challenge recent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) restrictions on visas for international students.
We plan to file amicus briefs supporting litigation filed by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that challenges the new restrictions. We also are working with our peer institutions, higher education membership associations, and state and federal leaders to explore other potential legal avenues.
The new directives issued by ICE on July 6 would have dramatic adverse impacts on international students across higher education in the United States. The federal Student and Exchange Visitor Program announced that visas would not be issued to students enrolled in universities that offer only online instruction this fall. Those already in the United States would have to either leave the country or transfer to a school offering in-person instruction. Harvard and MIT filed litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts on July 8 seeking to “prevent ICE and [the Department of Homeland Security] from enforcing” the new directive.
Our three universities are planning a hybrid approach to instruction this fall with both on-campus and online components, which should limit the impact on our students. Nevertheless, we are deeply concerned about the severe impact the new directive would have across U.S. higher education and will vigorously defend international students and their access to the world-class educational experiences in our country.
We reiterate our commitment to our international students and will do everything we can to support them, especially now, during this period of extraordinary global challenge.

          Dear students, faculty and staff:
As we prepare our three universities for new ways of engaging with students this fall because of COVID-19, we are extremely proud that our campuses embrace the diversity of the world that awaits our graduates.
Students from dozens of countries are integral to the globally connected University of Illinois System, and they are valued members of our family. They enrich our universities and greatly enhance the educational experience for all.
So, we are profoundly concerned about new visa limitations announced by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) that would forbid international students from living in our country if their universities operate solely online.
All three of our universities are preparing hybrid models for combined in-person and online instruction this fall. But safety is paramount and plans may be revised if the pandemic worsens. As was done last spring, it may be necessary to quickly shift to a distance-education model to serve the best interests of our students, faculty and staff, as well as the communities we call home.
Opening our doors wide to deserving students from all backgrounds has been at the core of our mission since the University of Illinois’ founding more than a century-and-a-half ago. And now, more than ever, a diversity of backgrounds, ideas and viewpoints is crucial as technology bridges the miles between nations, and as different human cultures and outlooks contribute various perspectives to building a better future together.
In this moment of shared global challenge, we reiterate our commitment to our international students. We will do everything possible to support them as they seek to expand their horizons and benefit from the extraordinary, world-class educational experience found at the University of Illinois System.
Sincerely,

                July 8, 2020 9:55 AM

        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
Beginning today, free on-campus COVID-19 walk-up testing will be available to all faculty, staff and students at the following locations:
COVID-19 testing sites
Alice Campbell Alumni Center, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday 
The testing tent is located just north of the building along Lincoln Avenue.
Parking is available near the Alice Campbell Alumni Center, on Illinois Street, at Krannert Center for the Performing Arts and in the lot at the corner of Lincoln Avenue and Illinois Street.

State Farm Center, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday 
The testing site can be accessed through the West Main Circle Drive doors.
Parking is available in the circle drive or the Southwest lot.

What to expect
Testing is free.
This walk-up testing is available only to university employees and students.
Individuals should refrain from eating, drinking, tooth brushing, mouth washing, gum chewing and tobacco use for 30 min before submitting their saliva sample.
Individuals will need to show an iCard or Illini ID (through the Illinois App) and will be asked to provide a saliva sample.
The sample collection only takes a few minutes. Typical test results are expected within five hours but can take up to 24 hours.
Individuals should line up outside the site locations while wearing face coverings and practicing social distancing.
Individuals (faculty, staff and students) will be emailed when their results are available in the McKinley Health Center patient portal.
Inclement weather (extreme heat, lightning, etc.) may force us to temporarily close all COVID-19 tent testing sites. Indoor locations will remain open. If you have concerns, please check the university's COVID-19 website or send an email to covid-19@illinois.edu.
The samples will then be assessed using an innovative process developed by our own COVID-19 SHIELD: Target, Test, Tell team. Unlike conventional nasal testing, saliva samples are collected non-invasively, without healthcare workers and with minimal use of PPE. The lab has received federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification.
More on-campus COVID-19 testing sites will be added in the coming weeks, with more than a dozen planned by August. As additional testing sites become available, we will post the most updated hours and locations here on the university’s COVID-19 website. 
All employees can participate in this testing effort during scheduled work hours without loss of pay. As always, it is important that, in consideration of operational needs, employees coordinate with their supervisor for prior approval to go to the testing during scheduled work hours. 
Widespread testing continues to be one of the key approaches in facilitating a successful return to campus operations. Thank you in advance for doing your part to maximize the safety of our university and our community.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Colleagues,
Monday’s announcement by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement of new visa limitations that will not allow most international students to take a fully online course load and still remain in the United States was unexpected and disconcerting. This adds yet another layer of challenging uncertainty in this time of global crisis for our international students here at Illinois. We sent the message below to all of our international students earlier today, and we will continue to communicate directly with them as we get more information.
As you know, we have previously announced our plans to resume on-campus instruction for the Fall 2020 semester with a blend of in-person and remote instruction. And we are asking all of our academic units and all of you to work with our international students to make sure they develop course schedules for the fall semester in consideration of these new restrictions.
We remain a university that is committed to upholding our reputation as a top destination for international students and scholars and a community that welcomes everyone who chooses to come here to live, work and study.
Sincerely,

Message sent to international students on July 7, 2020
Dear Students,
On July 6, 2020, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued much anticipated policy guidance for institutions that enroll international students in F-1 status during the Fall 2020 semester. The information in this email only pertains to students in F-1 status. 
Guidance provided by DHS varies by the model that institutions have selected for fall instruction. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will offer a blend of in-person and remote instruction; this is called a hybrid model. The guidance for the hybrid model is:
“Students attending schools adopting a hybrid model—that is, a mixture of online and in person classes—will be allowed to take more than one class or three credit hours online. These schools must certify to SEVP, through the Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status,” that the program is not entirely online, that the student is not taking an entirely online course load for the fall 2020 semester, and that the student is taking the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree program. The above exemptions do not apply to F-1 students in English language training programs or M-1 students, who are not permitted to enroll in any online courses (see 8 CFR 214.2(f)(6)(i)(G) and 8 CFR 214.2(m)(9)(v)))”.
How does this guidance affect F-1 students at Illinois? Since we have adopted a hybrid model for the Fall 2020 semester, the following is true for our students:
F-1 Students Currently Residing in the United States:
F-1 students may enroll in more than one online class (or three credit hours) but they cannot take all their courses entirely online for the Fall 2020 semester.
F-1 students must continue take the minimum number of online courses required to make normal progress in their degree program.
F-1 Students Residing Outside the United States: 
F-1 students residing outside of the U.S. are permitted to enroll in an online course of study, but they will not be allowed to continue to hold F-1 student status for this period. Therefore, the time spent abroad will not be counted toward the one full academic year in F-1 status required prior to becoming eligible for certain immigration benefits, including Curricular Practical Training (CPT) or Optional Practical Training (OPT). 
F-1 students who have not yet arrived in the U.S. may activate their F-1 status upon arrival in the U.S. If new international students are not able to obtain visas and travel to the U.S. in time to begin the fall semester they may choose to enroll in a remote study option or defer admission. Students who remain outside the U.S. will not be bound by regulatory requirements affecting F-1 students and are therefore not required to be registered full-time.
F-1 Students Registered for Thesis Credit: 
F-1 students registered for thesis credit (such as 599) can remain in F-1 status as long as they continue to make progress towards completion of their degree.
I-20 Issuance:
For all F-1 students attending school in the U.S. in the fall, new I-20s should be issued by Designated School Officials with a special notation, ""the program is not entirely online, that the student is not taking an entirely online course load for the fall 2020 semester, and that the student is taking the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree program."" F-1 students must have this updated I-20 to apply for an entry visa or travel into the U.S. Our International Student and Scholar Services is currently working to clarify this guidance from SEVP officials and will work with campus partners to update I-20s as necessary.
Please bear in mind this is still a fluid situation due to the nature of a global pandemic. We will continue to update you with additional changes and guidance as it becomes available. 
We recognize that this is a stressful time and that this announcement raises additional concerns for our international community. We are all in this together and we remain committed to ensuring that you are not left with a fully online course schedule that jeopardizes your student immigration status. The University, colleges, ISSS and others are working to better understand aspects of the policy that are not yet fully clear. We will continue to support you and advocate for you throughout your studies at Illinois.

        Dear Colleagues, 
For nearly a year, the team in the Office of Strategic Marketing and Branding has been hard at work developing new brand standards that will align the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as a single, unified brand. I’m pleased to share that those brand standards, and the guide that will help us all adopt them, will be released next week.
In anticipation of that release, I want to stress how critical this brand strategy is in our collective efforts to elevate the university and connect in powerful ways with our key audiences. It is my expectation that all units across campus will begin adopting and implementing the new brand materials and guidelines over the next six-to-twelve months.
I also want to share how excited I am about the brand that Eric Minor, our Chief Marketing Officer, and his team have developed. The brand is research-based and audience-driven. It celebrates the incredible strength of the university as a whole, while providing flexibility for individual units to celebrate what sets them apart. Most importantly, the brand was developed in collaboration and conversation with many marketing professionals and leaders across campus, and it will further unite us as one bold voice, sharing the University of Illinois story and the Power of I. 
When the brand guidelines are released next week, I encourage everyone to visit the website and learn more about the strategies, messaging, website standards and visual identity that will drive our brand. We should all strive to embody it, no matter what our role is at the university. By this time next year, I look forward to seeing the brand elements everywhere I look across campus, and reaching out across our state, nation and the world.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Students and Employees,
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act requires the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:
http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/
The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.
Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to marijuana in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s marijuana prohibition.
The university’s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.
The university’s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.
Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. University employees should contact Illinois Human Resources at (217) 333-2137.

                June 24, 2020 10:02 AM

          Dear students, faculty, staff and friends:
On June 30, we will say a bittersweet goodbye to University of Illinois at Springfield Chancellor Susan Koch after nearly a decade of distinguished leadership that has lifted UIS to its place as our state’s top-ranked regional public university.
Her send-off into a richly deserved retirement will be far quieter than we hoped. Just as it has with all of our lives, the COVID-19 pandemic has thrown a wrench into our plans to publicly celebrate Susan for everything she has done.
But it is only a delay. When COVID is under control and large gatherings like the one Susan will attract are allowed again, we will bring her back and honor her in person for her countless contributions – new programs, new facilities, new opportunities for students, new connections with the community, new world-class faculty, expanded athletics and record philanthropy.
In the meantime, we have prepared a short video with tributes from a few of the many people whose lives she touched across campus and beyond. We hope it shows her just what a mark she has left. If you get a chance, drop a note to share your thanks, too, and to welcome Interim Chancellor Karen Whitney as she steps in to build on Susan’s legacy.
Sincerely,
Tim"

        Online Teaching Academy
Dear faculty and graduate teaching assistants,
As we plan for Fall 2020 instruction, we anticipate an expanded need for online and hybrid courses to allow for social distancing in learning spaces (classrooms, laboratories, studios). To accommodate faculty and teaching assistants who may need to teach online and who would like to become familiar with tools and techniques for online instruction, we have created an Online Teaching Academy, which was first announced at the end of May.  The June session is currently underway with nearly 500 faculty participating. I write now to share details about the July and August Online Teaching Academies, which will be open to all interested instructors.
Online Teaching Academy
The university’s Online Teaching Academy is an opportunity for faculty and teaching assistants to review good practices and discuss different pedagogical approaches as well as to receive hands-on training on technical tools for online teaching and learning.
During the Academy, faculty will design their online and hybrid fall courses in a community of fellow instructors with the support of campus experts from CITL, Tech Services and college-level educational technology units. Teaching assistants will learn to support the instructional activities of the online classroom.
Sample topics for the Academy include: designing effective video lectures, providing feedback online, creating meaningful student engagement online, designing meaningful online assessments and utilizing online group work.
The July Academy will begin on July 13 and run through July 31. There will be an optional live session once a week on Wednesday from 10am to 11am, which will be recorded. All other sessions will be asynchronous, allowing participants to review at their own pace over the course of the week.
The August Academy will take place from August 3 through August 21. There will be no live sessions for the August Academy, making it completely asynchronous.
The July and August offerings will be open enrollment with no compensation for participation.
To sign up for the July or August Academies, please follow this link: https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/1647465. The deadline to sign up, for either the July or August sessions, is Friday, July 3, 2020.
Thank you for considering this opportunity to receive expert support in your fall course preparations.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

                June 23, 2020 3:30 PM

        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
On June 22, 2020, President Trump issued a presidential proclamation that suspends the entry of certain individuals to the U.S. This proclamation goes into effect on June 24, 2020 and will be valid at least through the end of this calendar year. The full text can be found here. We are still reviewing the full impact of the new order on our current faculty, staff and scholars, but it appears that our student population is largely unaffected. We are reaching out directly to members of our university community who may be impacted with more detailed information.
But this latest decision to restrict opportunities for international students and scholars is extremely disappointing and disheartening. 
For more than a century, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has been the institution of choice for the best and brightest international students and scholars. That influx of talent and ideas has brought new educational opportunities to all of the students in all of our programs, and it has contributed enormously to innovations and discoveries that have led to new jobs, new industries and dramatic economic growth for our state and nation. We are proud of our reputation as a global university that truly welcomes our international community.
We will continue to advocate strongly against any actions that are needlessly detrimental to this university. And we will always honor our commitment to support all of our students, faculty, staff and visiting scholars, whether domestic or international.
We are in communication with our federal legislators to ensure that they understand the risk these new immigration limitations pose to the future economic growth and prosperity of the State of Illinois and to the vitality of the state’s flagship university.
We are at our best as a university when our doors are wide open to new ideas, new perspectives and new ways of thought. That is why it is so disappointing to see these new immigration restrictions that will close doors to some of those who would be so welcome here at Illinois.  
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Students,
As you know, fall instruction will happen on-campus with social distancing. In order to lower classroom capacities, we have to make some changes to the class schedule.
Class Schedule Change Details
Student registration activity will be closed from July 11 to August 3 to allow departments, the Office of the Registrar and other central administration units to make necessary schedule modifications in the registration system.
Course changes may include:
Moving fully online
Changing to hybrid delivery (e.g., online lecture, in-person discussion )
New meeting times
New meeting locations
Distributed attendance—(e.g., not all students will attend the in-person class each day; instructors will provide schedule plan)

Beginning July 14, students (including new, incoming students) can view their August time tickets. This time ticket is the first day and time at which you may make modifications to your fall class schedule, if necessary.
The majority of schedule modifications will be completed by 6 p.m. on Friday, July 31. Please be aware that it is still important to continue to check your schedule periodically throughout the month of August, as minor modifications may still be made after July 31.
Your academic advisors, department and/or college offices will be reaching out to you starting in late July. Be sure to read any messages carefully and to connect with your advisor early and often with any concerns or questions.
Once changes to fall classes are finished, we will provide all students with an opportunity to review and modify their schedule, if necessary, prior to the start of the semester.
We appreciate your patience throughout this process. We know that uncertainty is frustrating, but please be assured that we are doing all we can to ensure minimal disruptions to your existing class schedule. We will continue to keep you updated as the process progresses. Thank you for your continued flexibility and understanding as we navigate forward together.
Sincerely,
Kevin PittsVice Provost for Undergraduate Education"

          Dear students, faculty, staff and friends:
Along with unprecedented challenges, 2020 has also brought historic progress.
Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision on LGBTQ rights, ruling that employers cannot fire workers based on sexual orientation or gender identity. It extends the protections of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and accelerates our nation’s course toward inclusion and respect for all. We welcome and celebrate this ruling.
The ruling reflects the values at the very core of our mission across the University of Illinois System. Equality and fairness must underlie everything we do. Our universities open their doors wide to students, faculty and staff from varied backgrounds, varied walks of life and varied points of view. 
The Supreme Court’s ruling provides an excellent opportunity to, once again, reaffirm our bedrock support for all students and for all faculty and staff at our three universities – those who identify as LGBTQ, those with disabilities, those who are veterans of the military, those who come to our institutions from other parts of the world, and those from the rich mix of ethnic, racial, cultural, socioeconomic and religious backgrounds that we cherish. You are all welcome here and, together, you provide the very heartbeat of the University of Illinois System, enriching it as a global leader in education and innovation.

                June 19, 2020 11:56 AM

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
Today, we commemorate the 155th anniversary of the end of slavery in the United States. This day, remembered as Emancipation Day, Jubilee, or more commonly referred to as Juneteenth, marked the victory of those who fought the injustices of slavery. Although, President Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, it was not until 1865 that Major General Gordon Granger brought word to enslaved Black people in Galveston Texas that they were now free.
These are facts that we will hear recounted many times today on the 155th anniversary of Emancipation Day, celebrating the struggle for freedom by enslaved Black people and marking the end of chattel slavery in the United States. For decades, the successes of the civil-rights movement elevated the date from observance to celebration. But in recent years, the tenor of Juneteenth has changed. Black Americans see more clearly just how deeply embedded racism is in the fabric of our society. In a country built on the subjugation of indigenous and Black people, our focus must also be on the fight to dismantle systemic racism. But for too long we have not collectively seen these pieces of our history, understood their implications, or fully reckoned with our responsibilities.
This year’s celebration of Juneteenth marks both a new beginning and the continuation of a process that has taken far too long. We have heard calls for racial justice throughout the years on our own campus, from Project 500 to Being Black at Illinois, a reminder that this fight has stretched not only across the past 400 years, but the entire history of our university. These calls have always been marked by resilience, endurance, resistance and action.
As Vice Chancellor I work every day from the deeply held belief that the progress that we have made since Emancipation Day in 1865 is nowhere near enough. I, like you, am tired of calls, tired of words that do not become substantial systemic change. We strive to be a university that acknowledges the past, recognizes our responsibilities, and find ways to improve broken paths to plan for a better future. It is a work in progress. It is incremental, and it is often insufficient. Equity is not a luxury. Equity requires that we wholly reimagine how we understand our responsibilities to one another, continually assess what we still need to accomplish and commit to improve. Equity demands that we acknowledge that as an institution of higher education we have the responsibility to fight systematic racism and dismantle mechanisms of oppression in order to create a more equal and just society.
Today is a day of celebration and a reminder of the work that we as a university must commit to in order to undo anti-Black racism. The road to achieve full equity is still long. As the Chancellor said yesterday, the past few months have underscored the renewed imperative that actions align with what we stand for. We cannot be a great university if we are not committing our resources – the breadth and depth of our expertise, our talented community of scholars, and the scale of our enterprise – to the betterment our local community while serving our nation to create a better tomorrow. The time to act is now. This Juneteenth marks my renewed commitment to you and the work that we will do together.
Sincerely,
Sean C. GarrickVice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion"

                June 18, 2020 4:01 PM

        Dear Students,
As was announced earlier, we will resume on-campus instruction for the Fall 2020 semester in a manner modified to address the ongoing pandemic concerns. The plan assumes that we have adequate COVID-19 testing in place, and we have moved into Phase IV of Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s Restore Illinois plan. Health and safety will continue to be our top priority, and we will rely on every member of our campus community to behave in a way that protects the safety of the entire community.
We plan to offer as much in-person instruction and residential occupancy as restrictions of space, health and safety allow. Face-to-face instruction will be supplemented by online instruction. 
For those students who are not able to come to campus, the university will offer online courses so you can continue to make progress toward your degree.
This message provides some additional details about what to expect. We don’t have all of the answers at this point, but we promise to update you when more information becomes available. You can also find an FAQ here with more of the information we have at this time. We will continue to keep it updated throughout the summer.
Health and Safety
In order for this return to in-person instruction to succeed, everyone in our university community will be required to follow guidelines by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD). This includes practicing social distancing, wearing face coverings (for those who are able), checking symptoms and adequate hygiene such as frequent handwashing and using hand sanitizer.
The university is developing capacity to provide all students, faculty and staff with free, regular testing administered by the university. You will receive more details on this in a separate message.
We are committed to cleaning and sanitizing all university spaces to minimize the potential of the virus to spread. Our Facilities & Services team has developed rigorous sanitation procedures and processes.
We will continue to closely monitor conditions locally and regionally. We will adapt our plans as needed.
Class Delivery
We will maximize in-person classes as much as possible, especially for courses that require hands-on, active and peer-to-peer interactions such as labs, performance-based courses and discussions. Face-to-face instruction will be supplemented by online instruction.
Classes that meet in-person will be in spaces that allow for adequate social distancing. As an added precaution, for the health and safety of all, face coverings will be required in all campus spaces, including classrooms.
Most large class sections are likely to be online or incorporate online components, in accordance with the Restore Illinois plan guidelines on gatherings.
We will have online options for students who are not able or who prefer not to participate in face-to-face or on-campus instruction.
Schedule Changes
Over the next several weeks, we will be making modest adjustments to the Class Schedule to account for these changes. While we anticipate that many student schedules will not require modification, there will be some cases where a scheduling conflict might arise. Please be patient as we work through these changes. We promise that you will have a chance to update your schedule in case anything needs to be modified. We will be back in contact in the future with more details.
We are currently making a determination about which course sections will be offered online versus in-person. Again, please be patient as we work through these details. We will be back in contact in the future with more information. Rest assured that we will help with any changes.
We are excited about the opportunity to resume on-campus operations in the fall. We also take your health and safety very seriously. Please bear with us as we address additional issues related to instruction and campus life in the fall semester. We will continue to keep you updated as more information becomes available.
Thank you for your patience and thank you in advance for doing your part to keep everyone in our university community safe. We will be in touch with more details through the summer months.

                June 18, 2020 3:14 PM

        Dear Faculty, Students and Staff,
As you know, our university leadership has been consulting with faculty, staff, students, the Academic Senate, community members and with local and state health officials to evaluate our options for delivery of Fall 2020 instruction.
All faculty, staff and students will be receiving more detailed information this week about what we know right now. We have posted a new list of some frequently asked questions with answers on the COVID-19 website.
As a public land-grant university, it is our obligation to provide accessible and equitable research, creative expression and educational experiences for people from across the state and around the globe. We come together here to challenge and debate the known, confront and conquer the unknown, advance the frontier of knowledge and improve the human condition. Our success hinges upon the vibrant learning communities that constitute the bedrock of residential universities like ours. All of us, together, share in all the good that our university makes possible. Its classrooms, libraries, rare book and manuscript collections, laboratories, studios, research institutes, performing arts spaces, gathering spaces and museums enable and inspire the face-to-face engagement and debate. This fosters the free and daring inquiry and the rich empathy and candor our world needs to deal with its current challenges and to change and to progress beyond them. The events of the past months make the importance for such conversations, engagement and experiences even more urgent.
The university is committed to doing all we can to maximize the safety of all members of our community. A commitment to the health and safety of our students, staff and faculty will be foundational to any decisions we make and all actions that we take. That is a commitment that also extends to the broader Urbana-Champaign community that supports us.
The university has been working diligently on ways to continue to fulfill our missions as we look to the Fall 2020 semester. In conjunction with public health officials, we have worked with our own experts, faculty and staff to develop plans for fall that prioritize health and safety and allow us to resume some level of in-person instruction and educational activity. Our working groups continue to make considerable progress on all fronts. Earlier this month, the COVID-19 Academics Affairs Team shared their report with the most likely scenarios and recommendations for Fall 2020 instruction. The feedback to the report was robust, diverse and candid. It provided the team with additional things to consider and concerns to address.
Based upon these ongoing efforts, and with considerable thought and broad consultation, we have decided that we will resume on-campus instruction for the Fall 2020 semester in a manner modified to address the ongoing pandemic concerns. This semester will consist of a blend of in-person and remote instruction. Along with a successful transition of our region of Illinois into Phase IV of Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s Restore Illinois plan, resuming on-campus instruction is predicated upon our ability to provide adequate COVID-19 testing for our entire community of faculty, staff and students, coupled with a comprehensive plan that looks after the vulnerable and aims at mitigating and containing any outbreaks. The COVID-19 SHIELD Team is advancing this plan, and they will be providing specific information about the plan in the weeks ahead.
In order for this return to in-person instruction to succeed, everyone in our university community will be required to follow guidelines by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD). This includes practicing social distancing, wearing face coverings (for those who are able), checking symptoms and adequate hygiene such as frequent handwashing and using hand sanitizer.
We cannot overstate that our own personal behavior will determine in a large part our access to all the good that our campus offers. It is up to each of us to take care of one another. In the weeks ahead, as we prepare to resume on-campus operations in the fall, we count on the unfaltering vigilance of everyone in our community. We still have a lot of work to do to get ready.
Thank you for your patience and thank you in advance for doing your part to keep everyone in our university community safe. We will continue to keep you informed about progression of our plans to reopen our campus in a safe manner.

                June 18, 2020 2:57 PM

          Dear students, faculty and staff:
We are very pleased to announce that on-campus educational activities will resume this fall at the University of Illinois System’s three universities, with a hybrid mixture of in-person and online classes. Of course, our collective decision assumes that Illinois stays on track to meet Phase 4 requirements established by Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s Restore Illinois plan that allow reopening of classrooms.
Plans to restore in-person instruction were developed through weeks of exhaustive review that brought together literally hundreds of key stakeholders and considered every available option, from a full return to traditional instruction to remaining fully online. 
Throughout, this work was guided by two, intertwined core principles – promoting the safety of our campus communities while maintaining the academic excellence that is synonymous with our best-in-class universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield. In the process, faculty, staff, administrative leaders and students drew upon the insights of our own healthcare and education experts, as well as best practices of peer institutions and guidance from state and local health departments, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Illinois Board of Higher Education.
The result is a thoughtful, science-based approach that will bring our universities back to life, with a campus experience that will look somewhat different. But the life-changing benefits will be the same – academic programs that lift students to the careers of their dreams, research that drives discovery and progress, and a healthcare enterprise that provides both patient care and innovation.
A system-wide coordination committee assisted groups at each of the three universities that have worked over the past few weeks to develop detailed plans for reopening. Each university will be providing details of their unique, campus-based plans within the next few weeks, including starting dates and calendars for their fall semesters. But here is a summary of elements that will be common to all:  
Instruction
Classes will be a mixture of in-person and remote instruction to provide the physical distancing that inhibits spread of the virus.
In-person courses and classroom schedules will be adjusted appropriately to ensure physical distancing and safer traffic flow.
Accommodations will be made where possible for students and faculty in vulnerable and at-risk groups, and for students who cannot come to campus due to travel restrictions or other considerations.
Classrooms will be cleaned and disinfected daily.
Reusable, washable masks will be provided to all students and required in all classrooms, and hand sanitizer will be widely available in all buildings.
Training for faculty and instructors is being provided over the summer to sustain high-quality online and distance instruction with state-of-the-art technologies and virtual modalities.
University housing/dining
Residence hall occupancy will be limited to two students per room.
Outside visitors will not be allowed in residence halls.
Quarantine areas will be created to accommodate students who test positive for COVID-19 or display symptoms.
Dining halls will largely provide packaged meals for carryout, and in-person dining will be limited.
Common areas will be cleaned and disinfected regularly, and hand sanitizer will be available.
Use of these common areas will be limited, and physical distancing will be observed.
Campus life
The size of gatherings will be based on standards under the state reopening guidelines in force this fall and beyond.
Use of auxiliary facilities such as recreational centers will be limited to preserve safety.
Outside visitors to campus will be asked to follow physical distancing and wear masks in public places.
Research
Research activities will continue a ramp-up that began over the summer.
As in classrooms, masks will be required and other safety measures will be followed.
Research will continue to support treatments, vaccines and other measures related to COVID-19.
Employees
Most faculty and staff will continue a phased-in return to work that began in June and will be completed by the start of the fall semester, though some will continue to work from home to reduce campus density.
Flexible work-from-home guidelines will be developed for the benefit of vulnerable employees and those with family-related considerations.
Work areas will be cleaned regularly, and hand sanitizer will be provided.
Masks will be required in publicly shared spaces and reusable masks will be provided to all employees.
We will continue engagement with our labor unions to discuss the impact of these plans.
Testing and notification
Our scientists are piloting cutting-edge testing procedures for the COVID-19 virus that are accurate, cost-effective and scalable to the whole university community and provide same-day results. 
We are partnering closely with local public health authorities to notify individuals at risk for infection and mitigate spread, through a combination of manual and rapid app-based approaches.
All app-based software will protect individual privacy so that positive test results are shared only with the user, and no location data will be required, collected or shared with third parties. Local public health departments will be provided test results based on required local, state and federal regulations.
General safety
Training will be required for all students and employees to ensure compliance with physical distancing and other COVID-related safety measures.
Hand sanitizer or disposable wipes will be available at building entrances, elevator lobbies and in common and high-traffic areas.
High-touch surfaces such as door handles and elevator buttons will be disinfected multiple times daily.
Flu shots will be strongly encouraged for all students, faculty and staff to lessen the possibility of dual outbreaks when traditional flu season begins.
The pandemic is still evolving, so our plans will be flexible and nimble. We will monitor campus safety and the latest guidance on the virus, and will adjust plans as needed to protect the well-being of our students, faculty, staff and the communities we call home.
Our plans for fall could not have been developed without you, and we are deeply grateful to everyone who shared their time and talents to guide us. And we know that you will now help lead the way again, modeling the safety protocols that are essential to make our plans a success.
The COVID-19 pandemic has been a test unlike any in our 150-year history. But thanks to your commitment and creativity, we have done more than just answer challenges to our operations. You are supporting the leading-edge medical treatments and scholarship that are helping the state manage the crisis and move beyond it. You are helping show the life-changing power of our universities – in real-time – that will write new chapters in our long legacy of excellence.
Be safe, enjoy your summer and we look forward to seeing you in the fall.

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
Earlier you received a message from President Killeen about today’s United States Supreme Court decision that will allow the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program recipients to continue to renew membership in the program that offers them work authorization and temporary protection from deportation. We are most vibrant as a nation when we welcome and support the most vulnerable among us to excel in their academic, creative and professional endeavors. Equity and inclusion are essential to our well-being as a society so that every one of us has an opportunity to pursue our dreams and transform our lives and the lives of others. Today’s decision affirms those values.
In the past few months, we have become acutely aware of how interconnected each of us is, and of the renewed imperative that actions align with what we stand for. We must act in ways that protect the most marginalized among us, dismantle systems that exclude and oppress, and as a university we must fight fiercely to protect the dreams and humanity of each and every one of us. The success of our university rests firmly on the principle of inviting the best and brightest into our community and supporting their capacity to thrive. The skills, imagination and determination that DACA recipients bring to our community represents the best of who we are as university. We vigorously advocate for actions, laws and policies that protect and advance that principle. The University of Illinois is committed to providing an accessible, world-class education for qualified and deserving students in the State of Illinois and beyond.
Our university will continue to provide access to financial support for DACA and undocumented students at both the university and state levels, and we will continue to protect confidential student and employee information to the fullest extent of the law. Consistent with its long-standing policy, the University of Illinois Police Department (UIPD) will not ask anyone about their immigration status, and UIPD does not arrest anyone solely on the basis of their immigration status.
Additional information about campus policies and resources related to DACA and members of our community who are undocumented can be found at https://open.illinois.edu.

We are grateful that DACA will remain in effect, providing a pathway to degrees without fear of deportation. More than 450,000 undocumented students are currently enrolled in colleges and universities nationally, a new study shows, including hundreds at our universities.
DACA reflects our values and our land-grant mission to open our doors wide, provide a high-quality education for every deserving student and create the next-generation workforce that is essential to move America forward. 
We hope DACA will now be allowed to stand, and end the fears and uncertainty that our undocumented students have felt since the legal battle began. And we will continue to advocate for federal legislation expanding their rights through the Dream Act, which would provide an opportunity to become citizens of what for many is the only country they have ever known.

        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
It is my pleasure to share with you that Alice Cary will become the Executive Director of Public Safety and Chief of Police starting July 20 pending approval by the Board of Trustees.
Cary is currently the chief of police at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, where she has worked tirelessly to implement the 21st Century Policing approach founded on building trust and legitimacy, policy and oversight, training and education, community policing and crime reduction, technology and social media, as well as officer safety and wellness.
In her current university law enforcement leadership role, she established a dedicated Campus Outreach and Support Team (COAST) that engages with the campus and the greater community to build trust through establishing personal relationships, improving communications, operating transparently and demonstrating a commitment to serving all people.
I want to thank the search committee for their diligent work in identifying an excellent pool of finalists, and I offer thanks to Interim Chief Matt Myrick for his leadership in this transition period and the entire Division of Public Safety for their service year after year.
There is no higher priority for us than ensuring that our community is as safe and secure as possible for our students, faculty, staff and visitors to work, live and learn. I’m excited to have Alice Cary lead that effort for us.
Sincerely,Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                June 16, 2020 10:01 AM

        Dear Colleagues,
I am pleased to announce the appointment of Professor Gene Robinson as interim dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences designate beginning on July 1. This appointment is pending approval by the Board of Trustees. Professor Robinson’s selection comes after consultation and discussions with other executive officers, senior academic leaders and members of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Executive Committee
Professor Robinson brings more than three decades of experience as a faculty member, academic leader and university administrator here at Illinois. A faculty member of the Department of Entomology, he is a Swanlund Professor and the current director of the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology. With membership in two of our National Academies, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the recipient of the prestigious Wolf Prize in Agriculture, he is a world-renowned scholar and teacher. His extensive knowledge and experience at every level of this institution will serve the College well during this critical year ahead.
A national search for the permanent dean of LAS will begin this summer. In the weeks ahead, I will consult with the College’s executive committee, department heads, faculty and staff about forming the search committee and I will share that information when it is finalized. It is my intention to have a new permanent dean in place for the start of the 2021 academic year.
Professor Robinson has agreed to serve in this role for the next year, at which point he will be resuming his permanent role as director at IGB. His IGB five-year review will continue as planned this summer.
I want to thank Dean Feng Sheng Hu for his leadership of LAS and his long faculty service to his college and university. I am deeply appreciative of his efforts over these final months of his Illinois tenure to help us navigate the unprecedented challenges the COVID-19 pandemic has brought.
Please join me in welcoming Professor Robinson as the interim dean of LAS. I am confident that he will have the full support of his colleagues and that under his leadership, LAS will continue to advance in its academic and scholarly missions with the optimism and confidence these unprecedented times demand.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

                June 3, 2020 10:03 AM

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
As you know, in April I charged the COVID-19 Academic Affairs Team to consider strategies for Fall 2020 instruction in the context of the COVID-19 global pandemic. I asked this group to identify instructional options informed by a variety of COVID-19 health and safety conditions that may be present in the fall, and to catalog the benefits and weaknesses of each option. I did not ask this group to make any decision about whether to have students return to campus. They have prepared this draft report sharing their analysis and recommendations, and I hope you will read it.
Report Highlights 
The health and safety of the community must be the most important consideration in any decision about Fall 2020 instruction. “Normal operations” (i.e., full face-to-face instruction) are highly unlikely to be a viable option for the fall given the current understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the guidance provided to us from our state’s officials about the anticipated state of the pandemic in Illinois in the fall.
The task force focused much of its effort on evaluating the feasibility of a modified approach to on-campus instruction, including a combination of in-person and online classes. This approach is appropriate only if:  
The University will have met all of the requirements necessary to proceed to Phase IV of the governor's Restore Illinois plan.
The campus and community will have adequate testing/tracing/exposure notification/quarantine capabilities and procedures in place, cleaning protocols and guidelines and procedures for safe campus operations. This includes testing all campus community members as they return to campus in August, along with a robust continuous testing strategy.
Students, faculty and staff will be required to agree to behave in a manner that maximizes the safety of the entire university community. This includes use of face covering as able and, when necessary, social distancing and other safe public health practices carried out on-campus and off.
Physical space and time necessary to carry out instruction have priority over non-academic or co-curricular activities.

The report also identifies several objectives for modified face-to-face instruction:
New and continuing students who do not return to campus for any reason must have access to courses and opportunity to make progress toward their degree.
Instructional faculty who are unable to return to campus for reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic should still have opportunities to teach and engage students remotely.
Even as the University must rely on remote course delivery for modified instruction, we should strive to maximize face-to-face instruction to the degree that safety allows.
To the extent feasible, units should have the ability to determine the appropriate delivery modality for their own courses.
The University should utilize face-to-face instruction where it can have the most impact on the student experience, in places like performance courses, studio experiences, laboratories and peer-interaction/peer-learning situations.

The report analyzes possible actions that will be necessary under any modified approach, including but not limited to the following:
Classroom space will be limited due to social distancing, requiring holding more classes at off-peak times, including evenings, and the use of non-academic spaces for classrooms.
Passing time between classes will likely have to be lengthened and protocols for entering and exiting classrooms developed.
Based on the recommendation by the SHIELD Team to minimize the number of times students return to campus, the Task Force proposes to start the semester as scheduled, and terminate face-to-face instruction on November 20, the beginning of Fall Break. The final 8 days of instruction along with 6 days of final exams would be conducted remotely.
The University should provide support for instructional faculty to develop courses in new modalities that strive to provide students with an excellent learning experience.

If the conditions for Phase IV status stated in Governor Pritzker’s Restore Illinois plan are not met, the University will have to adopt a fully online format.
I hope you will take a look at the full report and offer your feedback using this form by 5 p.m. on Wednesday, June 10. Chancellor Jones and I will review this report and your feedback and announce a plan for Fall 2020 instruction in mid-June.
Thank you for your continued patience as we work together to make the best possible decisions for our students, faculty, staff and community for Fall 2020.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

                June 2, 2020 12:16 PM

        Dear Colleagues,
In a massmail earlier today, the University of Illinois System summarized the overall budget situation and outlined the framework that our three universities are implementing to mitigate the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This message offers some more specific information about how our university will use that framework to protect our core missions and to allow us the greatest fiscal flexibility and margin to adapt to the extended economic challenges over the next one-to-three years.
We will also hold a live-streamed COVID-19 budget and finance briefing this Friday (June 5) at noon. I will be joined by Provost Andreas Cangellaris and Associate Chancellor for Budget and Resource Planning Paul Ellinger. We will be discussing the state’s preliminary budget framework and taking a number of questions submitted to us by campus business directors and budget committees. I invite you to watch the live-stream Friday at https://go.illinois.edu/covid-19briefing. This will be the first in our regular COVID-19 Briefing Series of live updates linked to our Return to On-Campus Operations Working Teams.
The state legislature’s action to provide state funding at the same level as last year was certainly welcome news and a vote of confidence in our institution. The funding bill awaits the governor’s approval. But with the pandemic’s massive negative impacts to state, national and global economies we realize that the state faces economic and cash flow challenges. The experience with the budget impasse of 2016-17, when cash-flow issues caused significant delays in state payments and, ultimately, a $189 million shortfall in our state funding is still vivid in our minds.
Our careful and thoughtful planning now will allow us to respond quickly, strategically and efficiently to the uncertain financial landscape that we must navigate in the months and years ahead.
Key Considerations in Our Budget Planning and Modeling:
So far, based on projections into this July, the estimated financial COVID-19 costs to our university in terms of additional expenditures, lost revenue and fee adjustments exceed $81 million. This estimate is expected to grow as we move through the summer and into the fall. In particular, we must anticipate and plan for potential tuition losses due to pandemic-imposed restrictions on residential programs, ability of international students to travel and attendance decisions by our returning students.
Additionally, declines in housing and concessions revenue as well as revenue from externally facing events and programs are possible in the near term. Self-supporting operations that depend on visitor/external revenue support (camps, conferences, arts, entertainment and athletics, for example) are particularly exposed to risk due to activity limitations. And the uncertainty of federal research funding and private philanthropy in the months and years ahead needs to be managed proactively and thoughtfully.
In summary, the financial impacts from COVID-19 will affect all major sources of revenue and all campus units across all missions. And given that it is hard to predict how long this pandemic and its fiscal implications will linger, we must consider scenarios for fiscal mitigation and recovery plans for the university that will continue for several years.
Some Key Actions and Strategies We Are Implementing:
We will continue to use the new Integrated and Value-Centered Budgeting model. We are working with tuition-generating units to consider mitigating factors.
We are temporarily delaying selected strategic planning investments. This includes delaying the latest round of funding for our Investment for Growth initiative.
We have implemented new hiring review processes that will evaluate requests for both mission-critical need as well as the budgetary impacts of the pandemic on a unit’s ability to sustainably fund positions. We expect many vacant positions to remain open for an extended period.
Working closely with all units, we are moving strategically and expeditiously to identify opportunities for operational efficiencies through operational excellence and benchmarking initiatives.
We are reducing travel and related expenses.
We are focusing on cost savings we can realize from reductions in non-personnel expenses, such as supplies and purchased services.
We are slowing down or postponing capital projects to preserve cash reserves and financial flexibility.
We are reviewing cash reserves across campus with the intent to pool these as a resource to offset some of the increased costs and reduced revenues. As we have done in previous uncertain budget situations, we have asked all units to hold a portion of cash and state funding allocation in reserve in case there is a need for a cash rescission later in the year.
We have asked units to prepare financial projections based on 5 to 10% reductions in state/tuition allocation for all campus units (including centrally budgeted units). 
Furloughs, pay reductions and layoffs, and across-the-board budget cuts are not in our current financial planning and we will employ other mitigation strategies before we consider any such options.
We are beginning to evaluate the possibility of early retirement programs as a longer-term mitigation strategy.
The budget news from our state was better than many expected. Yet, we are in the early stages of a challenging budgetary environment. Navigating our way through it in a manner that protects the integrity of our core missions will require determination, patience, cooperation, collaboration and fiscal discipline across every department, unit and college. This is our university and I know I can count on all of us to share the financial burden. This is the only way we will be able to continue to serve our students, achieve our full mission as a public, land-grant research university and look after the well-being and the livelihoods of our people to the best of our ability.
Out of our personal commitment to demonstrating that shared responsibility, I, along with all five of our vice chancellors, have volunteered to take a 10 percent pay reduction for the next six months. This savings will be directed specifically to our Illinois Cares: COVID-19 Emergency Support Fund to assist students in need. And I am very proud to announce that Director of Athletics Josh Whitman, Coach Lovie Smith and Coach Brad Underwood have stepped forward and volunteered to take the same reduction.  
But there are many, many other creative, effective and important ways everyone on this campus can help ensure that the financial impacts of COVID-19 do not damage the core missions of our university.
This collective approach and careful stewardship and planning helped us navigate shortfalls that at times approached $189 million just a few years ago.
Over the past few months, the determination and resilience of our university community have been inspiring. We continue to remain focused on the importance of our mission as the state’s flagship university. We are contributing vital expertise and services to the state’s efforts to manage and overcome the COVID-19 challenges. And I am confident we will lead the way to a post-COVID-19 environment rich in ideas and novel programs that will help us all thrive and help to rebuild the economic and social vitality of our communities.
I ask you to help us find and implement those ideas and approaches as we navigate through the financial impacts of COVID-19 that now face our university. 
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                June 2, 2020 12:01 PM

          Dear colleagues:
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the University of Illinois System and on each of us. We are so proud of the dedicated efforts by our faculty and staff to ensure that our missions of teaching, research, public service and economic development have continued with excellence during these challenging times. And despite these stresses, we have taken on new work to combat the virus – pioneering research on medical devices and drug treatments, providing epidemiological modeling to state leaders, issuing data-rich policy analyses, and most importantly, caring for vulnerable patients at UI Hospital and clinics. 
Of course, the pandemic has had a financial impact on much of what we do. The three universities have incurred significant expenses to adapt to distance education and remote work. We also have incurred revenue losses from adjusting room and board and several fee charges to students, and from cancelled programs and clinic activities. 
Similarly, our hospital has incurred many unanticipated expenses in order to treat those afflicted with this disease, while at the same time experiencing a decline in patient care revenue because of the required focus on COVID-19 patients. 
We are grateful for federal funding provided through the CARES Act. Unfortunately, that funding will not be enough to cover our costs. The fiscal challenges are likely to deepen in the coming months as the impact of the pandemic continues.
To manage the financial impact prudently, we are asking all units across the U of I System to immediately:
curtail hiring and only fill vacant positions that are critical to our missions
reduce travel and related expenses
reduce non-personnel expenses, such as supplies and purchased services and
slow down or postpone capital projects, except for those that are strategically vital and those already in process
Each university will provide detailed instructions to implement these new guidelines and budget planning for the upcoming year that address their specific institutional structures and allow them to continue to provide world-class instruction, cutting-edge research and scholarship and positively impact the citizens of Illinois and beyond.
Regrettably, we will not be able to provide a regular, merit-based salary program for the upcoming academic year. Salary increments will be limited to compression, equity, and promotional adjustments only. If our financial circumstances turn out to be better than expected, we will reconsider this decision later in the year.
Finally, members of the senior executive teams of the University of Illinois System and of its three universities, will all be taking a 10 percent pay reduction for six months of the upcoming academic year. This includes the president, the system vice presidents, and the chancellors and vice chancellors of the universities. The savings will be used to augment an emergency aid relief fund we created to support students who face financial challenges due to the pandemic.
We believe these steps, if implemented diligently, will help us manage the financial shortfall we face without resorting to furloughs or significant layoffs, actions we hope to avoid unless the situation worsens.
We have faced financial difficulties before, most recently during the 2016-17 state budget impasse. Together, we made many hard decisions, but we advanced our missions and thrived amid adversity. We are confident that working together we can fight this pandemic and emerge even stronger among the nation’s top public university systems.
Once again, we want to thank you for your understanding, adaptability and dedication. We will keep you updated about our finances as we move forward.

        Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,
Thank you for your cooperation in postponing our return to on-campus operations plans earlier this week.
I am writing to share that we are now ready to resume the plans to strategically and incrementally begin the return to on-campus operations process.
Units are now clear to resume implementing their return plans. This includes those involved in essential maintenance of our facilities or working in research labs and facilities. As a reminder, PIs and lab managers must have verified COVID-19 Safety SOPs in place before returning to onsite research activities.
Again, unless you were already instructed to begin reporting to campus this week, please do not change your personal current working arrangements until you are given specific new guidance by your supervisor.
I want to take this opportunity to thank our University of Illinois Police Department (UIPD) for their assistance in facilitating and supporting the peaceful demonstrations, so our community members could exercise their First Amendment rights. I am proud of UIPD’s continued efforts to build positive relationships across our campus and into the greater community, and I am proud of those members of our campus community who protested peacefully.

        Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,
As you know, in many communities around the nation and in our state, the reactions to the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer have moved beyond peaceful protest. Today, here in our local community, we are experiencing vandalism and looting.
We believe this unrest and disruption is likely to continue for an unknown period of time and in an abundance of caution for the welfare of all members of our campus community, all faculty, staff and students are to continue their current remote-working arrangements until further notice. Please do not return to campus unless you have specifically received permission to do so from your supervisor.
Faculty, staff and student workers involved in areas with specialized considerations such as those involved in essential maintenance of our facilities or working in research labs and facilities will receive further detailed guidance from your unit administrator this evening and throughout the duration of this situation. If you do not receive any new guidance, you should not return to campus.
The right of members of our community to assemble, protest and raise their voices is one of the fundamental values of this university. And as these next uncertain days unfold, we want to do all we can to ensure that our students, faculty and staff are free and safe to choose how they want to face this difficult time.

          Dear students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends:
A thunderous choir of voices rose across our nation again this week, condemning yet another senseless and disturbing killing of a Black man that has reopened deep wounds and fomented waves of anger, frustration and division.
The horrifying image of George Floyd dying as a police officer knelt on his neck is one that will be forever burned into our national consciousness. We hope that it will be the one that finally steers us onto a path of real change, toward the America that we can and must become.
We have stood at this same point far too often in recent history, from Rodney King and Trayvon Martin to the shooting deaths of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor earlier this year.
Every time, we felt the same outrage, and shared the same vow to finally achieve the true equality and justice that has evaded our country for far too long.
Every time, it has carried a heavy emotional and physical toll on the African-American community, spawning a new round of fear, distrust and anger. That toll, this time, is magnified by a global pandemic that has upended all of our lives, but has been disproportionately cruel to minority and underserved communities.
Let us make this outrageous act of aggression a pivotal point in history that begins to reverse generations of systemic racism and discrimination.
Let it start here and let it start now.
We must collectively work to spread the University of Illinois System’s bedrock commitment to inclusion, understanding and justice. Anything less from each and every one of us will undermine the future we all dream of creating – one that is truly worthy of our vibrant and diverse learning communities.

This is the home of one of the members of our Big Ten university family and our thoughts are with our colleagues and the broader Minneapolis-St. Paul community today.

We stand in the middle of a global health crisis that will claim hundreds of thousands of lives and burden millions of others for a generation to come. These are days when the health of our communities depends entirely on our collective commitment to care for one another. This is when we most need to come together.
It is painful to watch streets filled with more anger and more violence sparked by divisive sources of hatred that our nation seems unable to set aside even when we are all threatened by this virus that does not discriminate in choosing who it harms.
For some of us, this is very, very personal. But the grief, sadness and loss is profound and universal.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a community committed to the scholarship, engagement, equity, inclusion and leadership that dismantles systems that utilize power, privilege and violence to disenfranchise, diminish and destroy.
And unfortunately, this same pandemic that has disrupted so much, also prevents us from coming together physically here at Illinois. We are not able to help each other process what we are seeing and what we are feeling in the way we would wish. So, today, when we cannot raise our voices together, we want to share this message in the hope that it will remind everyone that we do not have to remain silent alone.  
George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery. Breonna Taylor. We can say their names and we can help ensure that they are not allowed to be forgotten.

                May 29, 2020 1:58 PM

        Dear Colleagues:
As you know, this week saw our region of the state progress into Phase Three of Gov. J. B. Pritzker’s Restore Illinois plan. This is welcome news for our entire community, and our university will continue to implement actions and develop plans to maximize the health and safety of our staff, faculty, students and community members.
Beginning June 1, it is possible that some additional employees will start to return to on-campus work. However, I want to remind you that your own personal current working arrangements will remain in place until you are given specific new guidance. Any changes to those working arrangements will come with notice to make any necessary personal arrangements and information about additional safety and health precautions that will be in place.
Those who work in laboratory research environments need to take additional steps. Principal investigators and lab managers must develop COVID-19 Safety Standard Operating Procedures and incorporate them into their lab safety plans, and lab personnel must read and acknowledge these safety plans and complete additional training. You will not be asked to return to work until these steps have been completed and verified by unit executive officers and the Division of Research Safety. If you have been approved to return to your lab, this process has been completed.
I know there are many questions in these very early days of this careful and phased transition. And as I have said previously, the return to on-campus operations will be different from unit to unit.
I am writing to share three sources of information that I hope will help address some of these questions or guide you to the best source for an answer:
Compiled Plans for Returning to On-Campus Operations
We asked our senior leadership team, including vice chancellors, deans and institute directors, to develop their own detailed planning frameworks for how and when additional employees might start returning to some level of on-campus operations.
Those plans have been reviewed and approved by our COVID-19: Executive Steering Committee on Return to On-Campus Operations, and units are now beginning to implement them.
Those plans have been compiled into this single, public document here.
We have redacted personal or private information in this document following the same standards we use in Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request responses.
Implementation of these plans will continue to involve careful consultation of public health expertise, with new campus-level guidance also expected from the Campus Executive Steering Committee and working groups.
Later this summer, the committee will help units assess progress, identify any emerging challenges and share best practices that have been identified in the initial return efforts.
RETURN TO CAMPUS: What You Need to Know  
This is a web resource to provide a central starting point for information about some of the most frequently asked questions we are receiving as we begin this transition.
This resource will continue to expand as we move further into Phase Three and Phase Four of the governor’s Restore Illinois plan.
University COVID-19 Website and COVID-19 Email
The COVID-19 Communications and Updates Archive is a running archive of all of the major central campus announcements and messages related to our COVID-19 planning and decisions since the beginning of the spring semester.
The Frequently Asked Questions Archive is a frequently updated archive of answers to a number of campus-level questions about COVID-19 and its impact on university programs and operations.
If you have questions that are not answered by these resources, please email covid-19@illinois.edu.
I know this is a complicated and difficult time for us all. And while the transition into the next phase of the Restore Illinois plan is welcome news, I realize each of these transitions will bring new challenges and new questions we will need to address together. Thank you for your patience and your continuing efforts to prioritize the health and safety of every member of our campus and our local community.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear faculty,
As we plan for Fall 2020 instruction, we anticipate an expanded need for online and hybrid courses to allow for social distancing in learning spaces (classrooms, laboratories, studios), accommodate faculty who may need to teach online and serve students who are unable to return to campus due to international travel restrictions or for personal reasons.
Online Teaching Academy
We are pleased to announce the university’s Online Teaching Academy, an opportunity for faculty to review good practices and discuss different pedagogical approaches as well as to receive hands-on training on technical tools for online teaching and learning.
During the Academy, faculty will design their online and hybrid fall courses in a community of fellow instructors with the support of campus experts from CITL, Tech Services and college-level educational technology units.
Sample topics for the Academy include: designing effective video lectures, providing feedback online, creating meaningful student engagement online, designing meaningful online assessments and utilizing online group work.
The Academy will take place from June 8 through July 2. Condensed versions of the Academy will be offered in July and August.   
The June Academy will include three-hour live online sessions on Tuesday and Thursday from 9 a.m. to noon for the first three weeks. Faculty will be given tasks to work on for their courses in between the live sessions. The fourth and final week will involve independent work time, with support on-hand. Live sessions from the Academy will be recorded.
If you are unavailable for some of the live meetings, you can still participate if you watch the recordings and complete the course design tasks on-pace with the Academy.
The June offering of the Academy is aimed primarily at those who have not taught online before and are developing content for Fall 2020 instruction. Please note that Spring 2020 experience with remote instruction will not be counted as online teaching experience for this purpose. Because the Academy is a combination of instruction as well as content development, compensation will be provided for participants that complete the elements of the Academy. 
The July and August offerings will be open enrollment with no compensation for participation. Dates, details and enrollment information will be provided at a later date.
Details on eligibility, sign-up and compensation will be available soon through your department or college. 
Thank you for considering this opportunity to receive expert support in your fall course preparations.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

                May 28, 2020 9:16 AM

        Dear Colleagues,
The University is working within the parameters of guidance and direction provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the State of Illinois, agencies such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and others to prepare for employees to return to on-campus operations.
While no final decisions have been made, it is possible that some employees will start to return to on-campus work beginning on or soon after June 1, 2020. However, your own personal current working arrangements will remain in place until you are given specific new guidance. Any changes to your working arrangements will come with sufficient notice to make any necessary personal arrangements and information about additional safety and health precautions that will be in place.  
Please be assured that we are working to return to on-campus working in a safe and responsible way. The use of good handwashing hygiene, face coverings and maintaining the principles of social distancing are important ways we can keep each other safe as we return to on-campus working. To reduce the transmission of COVID-19 infection, all University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign students, employees and visitors who are medically able to do so must wear a face covering in any university building, facility and classroom unless they are physically isolated in a private space or room. The University also requires maintaining six feet of social distancing whenever possible. We will provide two washable, reusable masks for employees and signage will remind all of us of our handwashing, face covering and social distancing requirements. 
We recognize that some employees may have unique individual circumstances that make it difficult to transition immediately from working at home or may have health or other considerations that present an elevated risk related to COVID-19. Please discuss with your supervisor or unit HR contact, as soon as possible, if you have a need to continue your current remote-work arrangements. If you are unable to reach an agreement with your supervisor regarding your remote-work arrangement, please contact your unit HR representative or the Labor and Employee Relations area within Illinois Human Resources at IHR-LER@illinois.edu or 217.333.3105. You are not required to share any medical information with your supervisor or HR representatives. Please note that, in some cases, referral to other university units or accommodation processes may be required in accordance with applicable regulations.
Factors to consider when evaluating whether you may need to extend your remote working arrangement may include:
If you or a member of your household fall into one of the categories identified by the CDC as being at high risk for serious complications from the COVID-19 virus, as public health authorities advise consideration of continuing to work remotely when possible; and/or
If schools, day-care centers or day camps are closed or unavailable and you would need to care for a child.
While we cannot guarantee that all requests to delay or modify your transition to on-campus work will automatically be granted, we are committed to finding ways to being flexible with our common goal of returning to on-campus operations in a safe manner.

                May 26, 2020 4:17 PM

        Dear Colleagues,
There have been a number of recent messages (May 6, May 12, May 21) with information about the broad planning efforts underway for a safe return to some level of on-campus operations through the summer. We want to give a more in-depth update on the status of our contingency planning and the operational considerations we are evaluating to make this important decision.
We still anticipate announcing our fall instruction plans in mid-June. I know I speak for all of us when I say that Booker T. Washington’s conviction that “there is no education which one can get from books and costly apparatus that is equal to that which can be gotten from contact with great men and women” is the bedrock on which universities like ours have built their reputation and stellar record as agents for good and prosperity for the world through free inquiry, education, discovery and creative expression. It is for this reason that we are working diligently toward the development of a plan for our return to the residential campus experience, guided by expert scientific and medical advice, in a manner that prioritizes everyone’s safety and well-being.
The Academics Contingency Planning team has been meeting for several weeks and consulting with faculty, deans, directors and instructional staff across the campus to identify a set of possible instructional scenarios and the logistics of the corresponding implementation. The recommendations and direction from the other six working COVID-19 teams will also play an important role in defining the nature of the fall semester.
While there are many considerations and assumptions that must be made in this process, these are the two that are most important.
We will not resume any level of on-campus instruction or operations if we do not believe we can do so in a way that maximizes safety. That level will be based on guidance from local and state public health officials, on our capacity for campus and community testing and tracing, on our capacity to provide the necessary personal protective equipment, on our university community’s pledge to look after one another’s well-being through our commitment to self-care and on our ability to comprehensively mandate and enforce the use of face coverings and other social distancing practices.
We will be able to provide flexible and equally accessible alternative options that allow for the protection or isolation of students, faculty and instructional staff who are unable to participate in in-person instructional environments. 
Given the current status of the pandemic and based on data models from our own researchers and others, we are hopeful that the fall semester will be delivered through some hybrid of in-person and remote delivery. We are evaluating scenarios based on that possibility. But if conditions require us to move to a fully remote semester, we must be prepared for that as well. Even with an expected smaller starting residential population, we will need to implement a number of additional significant steps to reduce the population density in physical spaces to meet the levels recommended by our state and local health officials.
We anticipate that the social distancing requirements in our instructional spaces, combined with issues related to airflow, ventilation and other safety considerations will mean most of our traditional classrooms will be limited to about 20-35% of their normal capacity.
We will need to develop approaches that offer class meeting opportunities to offset the space limitations. This goal can be partially achieved by more efficient utilization of these spaces (e.g., extending the instructional day, scheduling class meetings during traditionally lower-used days and times) but more online options are going to be needed.
These new space limitations, in combination with the expectation of a number of students and faculty who are unable to be physically present on campus, will also require us to provide a significant amount of material online.
We recognize the challenges of generating online content for the fall on such short notice, and we are establishing an Online Teaching Academy that will be offered to our faculty and instructors this summer to help them prepare for the fall term.
Modifications to our timetable/class schedule to allow for more passing times between classes to reduce congestion and density in hallways and public spaces may be necessary.
We are also considering how modifications to our schedules and delivery methods will impact our faculty and instructors, the student experience and the community in which we live and work. Important guiding questions we are asking include:
How do we determine which courses and programs have the greatest need for in-person delivery?
How do we accommodate faculty and students who cannot be on campus this fall (health concerns, travel/visa restrictions, personal concerns)?
How do we ensure that we deliver educational programs through all methods that are equitable, accessible and fair?
How do we give our departments and colleges the flexibility to ensure the best academic outcomes in ways that are consistent with our shared governance principles and practices?
How do we ensure our faculty and instructional staff have the flexibility to run their courses and to choose the delivery method that best suits their goals?
How do our instructional and residential decisions impact the community around us?
These plans are still in progress and will continue to be modified and refined after our mid-June decision to reflect any updated directives from Gov. Pritzker and our state and local public health officials.
And if we reach a point later in the summer when we do not believe the conditions we have set out to govern any level of return to on-campus instruction can be met, or if the progression of the virus does not continue to curve downward at a sufficient level, we will not hesitate to make the decision to return entirely to the alternative delivery method that we employed this spring.
I know the uncertainty surrounding such important decisions can be unsettling and frustrating. And while this update may not give you all the answers you would like at this point, I hope you find it helpful and informational to see how we are proceeding with our plans and evaluating the options and considerations that factor into these decisions.

Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

                May 26, 2020 3:01 PM

          Dear faculty, staff, students and friends:
State appropriations for the University of Illinois System would remain at current levels for the coming year under a budget approved over the holiday weekend by the Illinois Legislature that will be sent to Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who is expected to sign it into law.
Like many things amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the proposed $42.8 billion budget is contingent on a number of factors, including how the state rebounds from the crisis and on access to federal relief funding.
The budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 also re-appropriates capital funding to support key construction projects. That includes funding for development of our Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) and Illinois Innovation Network (IIN), along with major projects at each of our universities.
Highlights of the budget include:
An appropriation of $622 million for operations, matching state funding for the current fiscal year.
Re-appropriation of $500 million in capital funding for planning and construction of DPI and 15 IIN research hubs across the state, including one at each of our universities and satellite campuses.
Re-appropriation of $807 million to fund capital improvements at all three universities. Major projects include renovation of Altgeld Hall for a math, statistics and data science collaboration center in Urbana-Champaign; a quantum sciences initiative that Urbana is developing in partnership with the University of Chicago, Argonne and FermiLab; the Advanced Chemical Technical Building at UIC and a computer design research and learning center for UIC’s College of Engineering; and a new facility at UIS that will replace the existing library, along with a new Public Safety Building. 
Appropriation of $7 million in new capital funding to relocate Urbana’s Swine Research Center.
Flat funding that matches the current fiscal year for the Monetary Award Program (MAP), which provides financial aid to support Illinois students. The legislature also provided funding at current levels for the third year of a state scholarship program created to encourage in-state students to attend college in Illinois and stem an outmigration of talent to other states. The U of I System and other universities provide matching funds to double the impact of the state’s contribution.
The U of I System advocated for increased funding to support a flagship university system that has set enrollment records for seven straight years and has played a key role in helping the state navigate the COVID crisis. But we understand the financial challenges the pandemic has created and the shared sacrifice that is required to pave the way to recovery.
We are grateful to Gov. Pritzker, the legislature and our U of I Caucus for their support during this difficult budget process, and to all of you for everything you do to make the U of I System a key engine of progress for the people of Illinois.

        Dear Faculty and Staff,
We shared in this previous massmail on May 12 that you can expect to hear more details about your unit’s plans and timelines by June 1. As we get closer to that date, I want to share an update on our return to on-campus operations, so you know what to expect.
We will not begin returning until we are confident we can do so safely.
You have likely heard that Gov. J.B. Pritzker has announced his intent to loosen restrictions to the stay-at-home order beginning on May 29. Of course, we will follow the Restore Illinois guidance and the advice we receive from the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. But that is only the beginning of our considerations.
It is imperative to the safety of our entire community that we return to on-campus operations in a gradual, cautious and deliberate fashion.
This is our most important priority, and we are not going to begin this transition of additional employees until we are confident we can do so in a manner that maximizes safety.
You should not plan to return on-campus until your supervisor instructs you to do so, and then only if you do not have unique individual circumstances that make it difficult to transition immediately from working at home.
Information will come from your unit leadership. 
At this point, all deans and other members of the Chancellor’s Senior Leadership Council have prepared plans for how they will implement this transition for their own faculty and staff.
The Executive Steering Committee on Return to On-Campus Operations is reviewing those plans and will provide any feedback by June 1.
Seven teams also have been meeting and working to provide guidance on several critical and overarching issues such as instruction, research, events, testing and human resources.
We have begun sharing guidance on important elements such as mandated face covering standards, necessary signage, equipment needs and cleaning guidelines with facilities managers.
When they are ready, your unit heads will share with you directly how they intend to begin this transition.
The process and timeline likely will be different for different units. That is strategic and recognizes the specific needs and capacity of each unit.
We are committed to serving all employees. 
We recognize that some employees may have unique individual circumstances that make it difficult to transition immediately from working at home.
We encourage you to share those situations with your supervisor as soon as possible, so you can develop a plan together.
You should consider these factors from the CDC when evaluating whether you may be unable to return immediately:
If you or a member of your household fall into one of the categories identified by the CDC as being at high risk for serious complications from the COVID-19 virus; and/or
If schools, day-care centers or day camps are closed or unavailable and you would need to care for a child.

We cannot guarantee all requests will be automatically granted, but we are committed to finding ways to be flexible.
You can expect to hear more from Senior Associate Chancellor for Human Resources Elyne Cole on this issue soon.
It is imperative we coordinate with our local community.
Champaign County has created a list of local businesses that have taken the Champaign County Safe Pledge, a commitment to follow safety standards outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Illinois Department of Public Health and the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District.
You can find the list of businesses at champaigncountysafe.org.
I know this is a complicated and difficult time for us all. Please trust that we have your safety and well-being at the forefront as we are making decisions. Thank you for your patience as we navigate this together.

        Dear Faculty and Staff,
As I shared in this May 6 massmail, we have established an extensive, campus-wide planning and implementation framework to ensure a safe, careful and deliberate transition back to on-campus operations. This recovery initiative will be managed by the COVID-19: Executive Steering Committee on Return to On-Campus Operations in collaboration with seven mission-specific working teams that include broad representation from faculty, staff and students from across campus and across disciplines.
I have charged the Executive Steering Committee and the planning teams to work in two phases. The first will be to address the requirements and processes necessary for the opening of the fall semester in whatever configuration it takes. The second phase will address the continuing issues and impacts of COVID-19 into the fall semester and beyond. Of course, we will follow Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s Restore Illinois guidance and the advice we receive from the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. We cannot predict how the next few months will unfold, but we can be ready with contingency plans. These are the committees that have been charged:

The Executive Steering Committee and working teams are already establishing the goals, timelines and recommendations for how we will begin the return to on-site work this summer when the stay-at-home order is lifted or relaxed. Our vice chancellors, deans and institute directors have been asked to develop detailed, unit-tailored plans of how and when the faculty and staff in their areas will return to on-site work. We have provided them with tools, campus protocols and processes that have been established. They are working with their respective leadership teams and unit executive officers to customize these plans according to the needs of their faculty and staff. Those customized plans will be submitted to the Executive Steering Committee for review by May 18.
We understand that each unit has unique functional challenges, mission-critical considerations and even significantly differing physical space considerations. We want to ensure as much flexibility as possible, while also providing them with recommended actions, policies and processes. You can expect to hear more details about your unit’s plans and timelines by June 1.
Once again, thank you for your patience and understanding. I am committed to ensuring we return to campus in a manner that allows us to fulfill our missions while ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our community.

                May 8, 2020 9:01 AM

          Dear colleagues:
We are pleased to announce that a program providing additional paid days off during our December/January holidays has been extended to a fifth straight year, reflecting in real terms just how much we appreciate everything you do.
Employees who are eligible for leave benefits will receive three paid gift days for this year’s Reduced Service Days – on December 29, 30 and 31. Combined with holidays, other paid time off and weekends, it will extend the year-end break from Thursday, Dec. 24, through Sunday, Jan. 3. Before the program began in 2016, employees had been required to draw from their annual pool of paid time off to be paid for the three Reduced Service Days.
Our universities, hospital and clinics, and system offices will follow up with more details, including how to report the gift days and how they can be used on different days by essential employees who must work on December 29, 30 or 31.
For employees in union-represented bargaining units, paid time off for the holidays is addressed through the required collective bargaining process.
This has been a year unlike any in our long history. Your extraordinary commitment and hard work have helped us not only cope with the challenges of COVID-19, but write a new chapter in our rich legacy of service to students and the public good. Thank you again for your resiliency, sacrifice and dedication, and we hope the months to come bring a return to normal activities and a joyous holiday season with family and friends.

        Dear Student Colleagues,
With the end of the semester nearly upon us, I would like to send my wishes to you for the successful completion of your coursework and projects. I know this can be a stressful time under normal conditions, but the COVID-19 concerns have made it even more stressful. Hang in there and finish strong. Good luck on finals—you’ve got this!
And, as you complete your end-of-the-semester obligations, please be mindful of any Stay at Home orders and requirements for social distancing for your state. If you live in the state of Illinois, the current Stay at Home order and the requirement for social distancing as mandated by Governor JB Pritzker can be found at https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/. The order states, ""Any gathering of more than ten people is prohibited.""
As the weather begins to warm, I know it will be tempting to get outside and socialize. Your health and safety, and that of our entire community, is a top priority of the university. We want to make sure you can stay connected during this time, so please use your university Zoom account (https://illinois.zoom.us) to schedule time to gather virtually with your your friends and family throughout the summer. Please do your part to stop the spread of COVID-19 by practicing social distancing and adhering to all of the safety precautions set forth by the CDC during this pandemic.
I wish you good health and a wonderful summer!

                May 6, 2020 1:47 PM

        Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,
Today, the U.S. Department of Education released new regulations to guide the application of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which protects persons from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance. We are currently reviewing the new regulations to understand the compliance expectations of the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, and we will keep our community informed as we evaluate what will need to be put in place as part of our current Title IX reporting and response processes.
Let us state unequivocally: it is the position of the University of Illinois that sexual misconduct in any form is a direct violation of our institutional values. The new 2020 Title IX regulations are a minimum threshold set by the federal government with which our university must comply. Regulations, however, do not reflect the threshold of our university’s commitment to ensure safe and equitable access to a learning environment free from discrimination based on sex, which includes sexual misconduct.
Our university is committed to work with stakeholders to uphold the following principles and values:
We will continue to be committed to a fair and balanced process for both reporting and responding parties.
We will continue to provide resources and supportive measures for anyone who needs them.
We will continue to provide Confidential Advisors for survivors of sexual misconduct as required by Illinois state law.
We will continue to prioritize the physical and emotional health of our community, as well as provide medical support when it is needed.
We will continue our commitment to sexual misconduct prevention work to create a university culture of consent and respect.
We will continue to provide training for professional staff and administrators on processes and skills to reduce re-traumatization and harm.
We will continue to support and advocate for the rights of LGBTQ students, faculty, and staff.
We will continue to work to implement recommendations from task forces, committees, and exploratory groups.
Federal regulations may change, but our community responsibility to prevent and respond to sexual misconduct extends well beyond rules and mandates. In anticipation of this release, we have engaged at both the university and system levels in a comprehensive review of the November 2018 proposed regulations, advised by campus units and stakeholders with extensive experience and expertise in prevention and response. With this final release, our next steps are to carefully review the new regulations, identify processes that may need to change in consultation with campus experts, and implement the changes. The new regulations will go into effect August 14, 2020.
For more information on reporting sexual misconduct and how to support survivors and any others who need it, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.

                May 6, 2020 1:16 PM

          To our students, faculty, and staff:
Among the Guiding Principles of the University of Illinois System is one that promises: “We will respond expeditiously to discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct, and bullying with policies that are legally appropriate, fair, and widely understood.” This principle is particularly noteworthy today as the U.S. Department of Education issued new regulations regarding the handling of sexual misconduct allegations under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 – changes that will affect all of us as we work to provide safe and welcoming campuses for our more than 100,000 students and employees.
The changes under Title IX are both lengthy and complex, and our attorneys, Title IX officers, and other administrators are reviewing them to gauge their precise impact on all of us.
The new rules include provisions about which we expressed concerns last year when the Department of Education offered the opportunity to comment on proposals being considered. We remain concerned about an overly narrow definition of sexual harassment, a single grievance procedure for both students and employees, and hearing processes that require participants to be subject to cross examination.
As a public university system, we will always comply with Department of Education rules. Almost certainly, though, the new regulations will be subject to litigation that could delay their implementation.
Each of our universities will follow up with more-detailed statements in response to the new regulations. In addition to the U of I System’s review of these regulations, we will continue our ongoing efforts to foster safe learning environments. A system-wide task force recently spent more than a year developing a holistic approach to the prevention of sexual misconduct and fostering a safe, healthy culture for learning and success. Those efforts will continue in partnership with each university.
We thank all of you who have so closely followed this ongoing discussion. Be assured that the U of I System will continue to support our universities as they work toward our collective goal of building campus communities that do not tolerate sexual misconduct, harassment, bullying, or violence in any form.
Sincerely,
Tim KilleenPresident

We recognize that families need time to plan for the fall term.
We anticipate a formal decision and announcement on fall instruction by the middle of June.
We will be in touch as soon as we have more information. Until then, thank you for your continued patience. You are the life of the campus and I am eager to see you back in Champaign-Urbana.

        Dear Faculty and Staff,
Though we are still under the stay-at-home order from Gov. J.B. Pritzker, we are actively planning protocols we intend to put in place once employees who have been working remotely can begin returning to on-site work.
Deans and other members of the Chancellor’s Senior Leadership Council are preparing detailed plans for how they will implement this transition for their own faculty and staff. These leaders will be working with unit executive officers and others to formulate their respective plans that address their unique functions and are tailored to the specific needs of their faculty, staff and students. 
I have charged a steering committee to lead our COVID-19 recovery planning response, and that committee will be led by Senior Associate Chancellor Mike DeLorenzo. We also have charged several COVID-19 recovery planning response subcommittees in these areas: academics, campus life, community and public engagement, finance and operations, human resources, research and scholarship and testing, tracking and monitoring. We will provide extensive information about each of these committees, their charges and their progress as we move forward. 
On-Site Working
Our transition to on-site operations will be done in a gradual, disciplined manner that is guided by scientific evidence and the safety and well-being of our students, faculty, staff and greater community.
Our goal is to steadily and safely increase our on-site workforce to near full-capacity over the summer to prepare for the new academic year.
The timing and the working arrangements of individual employees will not be the same for everyone. This allows our colleges and departments the necessary flexibility to implement their specific plans within parameters outlined by public health officials.
Gov. Pritzker has ordered that masks be worn in public, so the university will be supplying units with masks for employees who will be working on-site any time before Aug. 16.
Fall Instruction
We have not yet made a decision about the delivery of fall instruction, but we are actively engaged in planning for a number of contingencies.
Our goal is to ensure that we do all we can to maximize our students’ educational experiences.
We firmly believe the residential experience is an important part of the growth and development of our students, and it is our goal to return to that model as soon as possible in a manner that respects and prioritizes everyone’s safety and well-being.
We recognize that families need time to plan for the fall term.
We anticipate a formal decision and announcement on fall instruction by the middle of June.
I look forward to the day when we can begin the careful process to bring everyone back together in person. It will take each and every one of us to do our fair share to look after the health and well-being of one another. We have done it before and we will do it again.

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
We know the sudden transitions in spring instruction caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have come with new challenges and unwelcome stress. In response to many requests from our students and in consultation with the Academic Senate, we are further extending some key deadlines for student course grading and credit decisions.
For full-semester and for second eight-week courses in Spring 2020, the following deadlines have been extended to May 6:
Drop
Elect credit/no credit
Rescind credit/no credit election
Elect the Grade Replacement Policy
Rescind Grade Replacement Policy election
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
For all Spring 2020 full-semester and second eight-week courses, all undergraduate and graduate students now have until May 6 to:
Drop a course by 11:59 p.m. CDT via Student Self-Service.
Elect Credit/No Credit or to rescind their election of Credit/No Credit. Credit/No Credit election and rescinding are done through a student’s college office. See the Credit/No Credit FAQ for a list of college offices. IMPORTANT NOTE: Some colleges require consultation with an advisor or dean to elect or rescind Credit/No Credit; this consultation would need to be completed by the time established by the college office. Be sure to contact your college office to find out specifics.
For all Spring 2020 full-semester and second eight-week courses, all undergraduate students now have until May 6 to:
Elect the Grade Replacement Policy or to rescind election of the Grade Replacement Policy. Contact your college office for information on this policy and how to submit the appropriate form(s).
Students in the following professional programs are excluded from the Spring 2020 academic policy modifications and should consult their college with any questions regarding their spring courses:
Doctor of Veterinary Medicine students in the College of Veterinary Medicine
Students in the College of Law
Students in the Carle Illinois College of Medicine
Further details are available in the Academic Policy Modifications – Spring 2020 on the Office of the Provost’s website.
We hope this additional time to make final grading and credit decisions gives our students more and more options in these final weeks of the semester.
And I ask our faculty and instructional staff continue to exercise creativity, flexibility and compassion in structuring your courses in ways to help your students succeed.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

          Dear colleagues:
I write to inform you that I have created a system-wide coordinating committee to support our universities as they begin planning for the reopening of campuses in the fall and examining the changes that will be required to ensure both safety and excellence.
The committee will help make certain that leaders at our three universities are all benefitting from the best and latest scientific and health information about COVID-19. Each university is also looking at the distinctive issues that are involved in resuming on-campus classes and activities this fall at institutions that differ widely in size and scope.
Transitioning to a “new normal” while retaining our world-class educational experience and protecting the health and safety of our campus communities will be the overriding priority. Included in the coordinating committee’s planning will be issues such as how the pandemic will affect class sizes, residence hall occupancy, large sports or entertainment events, and other traditional campus activities.
The coordinating committee will be co-chaired by Barb Wilson, executive vice president and vice president for academic affairs, and Avijit Ghosh, vice president and chief financial officer. It will include the three provosts from our universities, two vice chancellors overseeing student affairs and research, and a tenured faculty member from the University Senates Conference.
The fall semester may not look exactly the same as when you left our campuses. But I am confident that with the appropriate protocols in place, we will restore much of our face-to-face teaching, as well as lab-based research, residential life and the other unique benefits that make our campus communities second to none. The committee will explore every option to ensure the well-being of students, faculty and staff, including new cutting-edge technologies and devices that are being developed every week as science learns more about the virus.
For now, it is incumbent on all of us to stay the course and continue following Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s new stay-at-home order, which extends through May 30. I am deeply grateful to all of you for everything you have done to keep our operations rolling while also doing your part to slow the virus’ spread. Scientific evidence shows that our collective efforts are working in Illinois and it is now time to plan for our future. 
I look forward to the fall when we can come back together and bring our campuses back to life. In the meantime, thank you again for your sacrifice, understanding and commitment. Take care of yourselves, and each other.
Sincerely,
Tim"

                April 23, 2020 10:01 AM

        Dear Colleagues,
Over the past month, we have achieved a relatively stable COVID-19 operational status as a university, and we are well-positioned to maintain that stability through the end of the semester.
Clearly this pandemic will have significant and lingering economic impacts locally, statewide and nationally. So far, based on projections into this July, the estimated financial COVID-19 costs to our university in terms of additional expenditures, lost revenue and fee adjustments exceed $70 million. And with the pandemic effects expected to linger for months, it is likely all of our traditional funding sources will see negative impacts in the years ahead. We will continue to prioritize efforts to protect the safety and health of our students, faculty and staff and to protect our ability to deliver on our teaching, scholarship and engagement missions. 
COVID-19 has disrupted every aspect of our university operations. But collectively, in the space of weeks, we have come together to navigate a path through this. We will ask for the same collective effort and commitment to proactively manage the financial challenges that the pandemic will set for us.
Our actions during this time have been designed to protect our community, and we continue to steward our resources responsibly. We are continuing to allow hiring under a set of new guiding principles and with some additional review processes. These principles include financial parameters that need to be met. We are closely monitoring the fiscal health of all campus units. And we are focusing resources on financial planning and forecasting. This includes tuition modeling, evaluating multiple state funding scenarios and quantifying revenues that might be lost either temporarily or permanently.
As it has done with so many other aspects of our operations, COVID-19 has introduced new uncertainty into our financial status. But it is most certainly necessary for us to carefully evaluate our current situation, model for a wide range of possible future scenarios and manage our resources with even greater strategy and care.
We have plenty of institutional experience in managing budget challenges. And it was sound fiscal management across the entire university that saw us continue to move forward and upward through those challenges.
As we get more clarity about both short- and long-term economic impacts of the pandemic and as we implement actions to mitigate them, we will share that information with the campus community.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Students,
We recognize that the COVID-19 pandemic has created some very challenging circumstances for you. In particular, we understand that the rapid transition to remote instruction along with the Governor’s stay-at-home order have led to additional, unexpected financial challenges. 
To help those of you with financial needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have created, using money from the federal CARES Act, through the University of Illinois System's Students FIRST: COVID-19 Emergency Fund, the Illinois Cares: COVID-19 Support Program. 
You can submit a request for a grant that does not need to be repaid of up to $1,000 to help with financial challenges associated with COVID-19. Students may request above $1,000 but only in cases of extraordinary need, and those requests will require additional documentation. If you lost your off-campus job, have additional medical expenses or have technology needs associated with the pandemic, we have funds that can help you.
The application for this program is here: http://odos.illinois.edu/community-of-care/emergency-dean-fund/.
You will be asked to describe the type of need that you have and the reason you are requesting financial support. Depending upon the situation, we might ask you for additional information or documentation. 
If you are awarded funding, it will come to you in the form of a grant that will be processed through your student account and will be directly refunded to you so that you can use it based upon your need. If you currently have a balance due on your student account, the emergency grant will not be applied towards these charges. 
If you have questions about this program, please contact the Office of Student Financial Aid at finaid@illinois.edu or 217-333-0100.

        Dear Illini,
As we transition into a new phase of education in an online environment, we are all learning to navigate the new challenges that come with learning outside of a traditional classroom setting. One of these new challenges includes preventing and handling disruptions in virtual classrooms, meetings, and events—all of which have been witnessed in the Illini community. These disruptions can often be harmful to those who experience them.
Despite good faith efforts by all members of our community to acclimate to this new digital environment, we are still faced by acts of hate targeted at the most marginalized members of our community. This was particularly present on Monday, March 30th, when a group of individuals invaded a Zoom-based I-Connect workshop and displayed antisemitic imagery alongside shouting of violent antisemitic, racist and misogynistic language at the participants and facilitator staff on the Zoom meeting.
While this incident is a clear example of antisemitism, racism and misogyny, it is unfortunately not the first example of this type of violence exhibited at this University. This incident follows a pattern of acts of hate that have been exhibited in our community that have often gone unacknowledged, both by University administration and by our own Student Government. We recognize, first and foremost, the harms that have been done to members of our community through this inaction, and we seek to prioritize the needs of members of our community who have been targeted by this type of harassment. The Office of Inclusion and Intercultural Relations has released a statement regarding recent Zoombombings as well as actions that have been taken since. You can view the statement here: https://oiir.illinois.edu/news-statements/oiir-statement-regarding-zoombombing.
While it is impossible to undo the pain that incidents like this inflict on those who are targeted, it is our responsibility as student representatives to work to mitigate it as much as possible. We write today with resources that we hope will help you to find community, strength, and comfort during this time.

        Dear Students,
As we are all well aware, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to sudden and unprecedented disruptions of the university experiences we all expected when the semester began. As a result of this unexpected change, some of the services physically tied to the campus are not available.
In addition to the billing adjustments already in process related to University Housing (including dining), we are making immediate downward adjustments to Student Service and Campus Transportation fees to reflect the loss of access since March 14. This will translate to approximately a 53% reduction to the Service and Campus Transportation fees this semester. These adjustments will be applied to student accounts as soon as possible. Students who have paid full semester costs in advance will see a credit and those paying on installments will see remaining payment amounts reduced accordingly. These adjustments will not affect student financial aid awards.
How Much Will These Adjustments Be?
Charges ended on March 14 for students with a contract for University Housing and/or dining who returned to their permanent homes. Their accounts have been credited accordingly. Residents who choose to remain in University Housing as part of Continued Housing will continue to be charged room and board at rates adjusted for the changes this semester has required. For more information, visit the University Housing website.
Students who were assessed the Service Fee and/or the Campus Transportation Fee will see a 53% adjustment credit to each. The Service Fee credit amount will be $157. The Transportation Fee credit amount will be $33. Many undergraduate and graduate students who received fee waivers for the semester have already had the Service Fee waived.
These credits will be applied to student accounts. You may view the status of your account with the Self Service app. Please allow up to two weeks to see changes reflected.
Some Campus Fees Are Not Being Adjusted, Why Not?
We have several fees that are dedicated to campus infrastructure and maintenance that are not tied to specific services and periods of use. These fees support permanent improvements that serve the entire university community such as classroom renovations, deferred maintenance for student-used facilities, debt service, bike paths and student scholarships.
Student Health Insurance fees cannot be adjusted. The Student Health Insurance covers students while they are on-campus, away from campus and abroad and may be used to protect students during the current pandemic.
Fees related to specific academic programs or courses are not part of this central campus adjustment. Departments and colleges are addressing any adjustments to specific course fees resulting from COVID-19 disruptions separately.
Ensuring our courses continue to deliver the desired learning outcomes has been a priority in the transition to alternative delivery. And as we have communicated previously, there will be no tuition adjustments for the courses that continue this semester.
We fully recognize that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a nationwide conclusion to an academic year no one ever imagined. And we understand that the sudden changes here at Illinois have been stressful and disruptive for every one of our students. We continue to work through the challenges that these sudden changes have created in the way we operate. Thank you for your understanding.

        Dear Faculty,
We know it has been a hectic month with the transition to remote instruction and frequent updates on campus operations and some of our critical instructional tools, like Zoom. Thanks for looking after the continuity of instruction for our students. Those of you who plan on using Proctorio for proctoring of online assessments should carefully read this email as it contains important updates.
Previous instructor guides for Proctorio and the training workshops conducted last week had incorrect information about how to set-up exams. Students will be unable to take your exam if you used the incorrect instructions. We sincerely apologize for this error and any confusion it may have caused.
If you previously downloaded an instructor guide, please visit and redownload the updated guide at https://ops.citl.illinois.edu/proctorio. Additionally, you can contact Proctorio support (https://proctorio.com/support ) via email or live chat to have them double-check your exam settings.
Please note that we are seeing approximately 5-10% of students who do not have sufficient technology (lack of webcams or too little RAM) or internet access (too unstable or too slow of upload speed) to utilize Proctorio. Please plan on alternative arrangements for such students.
Guidance on technology requirements and more Proctorio tips are available online for faculty and for students.
Thanks for all your diligent work to keep learning during this semester. Stay healthy!

        Dear Student Colleagues,
We understand these are challenging times, but we look forward to the day when we can all get together to celebrate being an Illini.
One of those times we hope we can come together is Homecoming 2020, with festivities set to take place from Oct 11-17. To make the week even better, we need your help!
Last year “Always True to Orange and Blue” was the theme that carried us through the week.
Students, faculty, and alumni showed their Illini pride by displaying their school colors at every chance possible. You can help us determine the look and feel of this year’s celebration by submitting your homecoming theme idea, and later voting on the top 5 submissions.
Be creative with your ideas! As an example, we encourage you to think about ways to incorporate iconic or memorable parts of campus (The Quad, Alma, Altgeld Chimes). These could be part of a theme that can then be taken and used in a variety of ways to make Homecoming Week even better!
This survey will take less than 5 minutes and will be open for one week. The top 5 theme submissions will be announced to you via email, for a final vote.
Submit Theme
Here are some examples of previous homecoming themes:
Bleed Orange
Always Illini
Orange Fever
Feel the 'Nois
We will announce the winner on the Homecoming website and Illinois Alumni Facebook account May 2020.
We're looking forward to hearing your ideas!
In Orange and Blue,

                April 6, 2020 5:32 PM

        Dear Students,
It has been almost three weeks since our last student letter. McKinley remains in full operation for acute and subacute services. The purpose of this update is to provide information on how you can access services whether you are back home or in the local community.
On Saturday, March 21, the Governor’s shelter-in-place order went into effect and has now been extended until April 30. While telehealth and in-person appointments are available, they must be made by calling us at (217) 333-2700. We will provide services via telehealth and consider in-person appointments as needed.
McKinley Health Center staff are working remotely with a small number of staff in the building each day based on the demand for face-to-face visits. Outlined below are updates regarding our services:
Respiratory Issues: McKinley has a dedicated unit for respiratory issues. If you have had an acute respiratory issue within the last 7-14 days, we need to speak with you and schedule an appointment for evaluation and possible testing. Chronic asthma and allergy issues are being handled via telehealth or are being seen in other clinical areas within the health center.
Pharmacy: Speak with your doctor or the pharmacist regarding refills. In many cases, our pharmacist can bring your refill out to your car, so that you do not have to come into the building. Call the pharmacy at (217) 333-2700 in order to coordinate your pickup.
Mental Health: Most of our mental health professionals are providing counseling via telehealth. Our psychiatrists are working both onsite and remotely. Call (217) 333-2700 to schedule these appointments.
Allergy Shots and Vaccines: Routine allergy shots are given in our West 1 Clinic at this time. If you are currently receiving a vaccination series and need the next shot in the series, this service is available as well. We are not initiating other vaccinations at this time.
Medical or Injury-Related Visits: Acute problems are being screened via phone or telehealth and then scheduled as needed in our medical clinics. Chronic disease management (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) is still available. No routine or elective care is being provided.
Women’s Health: Acute needs are being handled via telehealth or face-to-face visits. Follow-up for an abnormal pap smear or other conditions needing follow-up are viewed as essential care. No routine care (e.g., elective physicals, IUD insertions, routine STD screening) is being provided while the current shelter-in-place order is in effect.
Health Education: SportWell, Stress Management, Nutrition, and Sexual Health services are available as needed via telehealth, with limited face-to-face visits.
Lab and X-ray: Both areas are fully operational. When referred by McKinley staff to one of these areas, they will assist you in scheduling services in order to avoid overcrowding. If outside orders or routine labs are needed, please call (217) 333-2700 to schedule a time to come in to these locations.
Many students are at home for the remainder of the semester, but can still contact us as needed, by calling (217) 333-2700. Our telehealth capabilities allow us to continue to offer patient care with the benefits of technology. The university is a leader in technology and this makes us all proud to be an Illini!
You can watch our recent YouTube Video and follow us on YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook for additional updates and wellness information. You can also continue to send questions, thoughts, or recommendations to us at studenthealthcenter@illinois.edu.
Stay safe!

                April 6, 2020 10:02 AM

        Dear Members of the University Community,
To ensure that we keep our university community and visitors safe during the COVID-19 pandemic and to return to normal business as soon as it is safe to do so, we have made the decision to cancel all university summer camps through July 10, 2020 and all summer events until further notice. We have waited as long as possible to make this decision, and we know it will have impacts on families throughout the state and beyond, as well as businesses that provide support and services to our university community year after year. But the safety and well-being of our Illinois family and our guests is always our number one priority.
Camps
As you know, the state of Illinois is under a stay-at-home directive to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. We do not know when it will be safe to resume in-person activities, and camps require time for planning and logistics, so we cannot wait any longer to make this decision.
We define camps as organized daily or residential recreational, academic or athletic offerings on campus or sponsored by the university, at any location, for young people during summer vacation.
All camps scheduled to begin before July 10 are canceled. (Illinois Extension has made the decision to cancel all summer camps through at least July 31.)
We will make a decision about camps currently scheduled to begin after that date as soon as possible.
Events
We have cancelled all events through the end of the semester, May 16.
We are following State of Illinois guidance on gatherings, so no summer events will be held until the statewide stay-at-home directive expires.
We define summer events as organized activities sponsored by the university and/or held in university facilities that involve gatherings of small to large groups of people. Examples would include conferences, tournaments, weddings and concerts.
Once the stay-at-home directive is lifted, any summer events must comply with social distancing and crowd limits as directed by the governor’s office. When this happens, we will provide more information about summer events protocols.
If you have additional questions about specific camps and programs, please contact either the camp’s organizers or the event’s hosting venue.
Thank you for your continued patience and kindness as we navigate these uncertain times.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

I hope to see you back on campus soon. In the meantime, take care of yourself and each other.

                April 3, 2020 8:29 AM

        Dear Faculty,
Thank you very much for all your efforts the past couple weeks to ensure the continuity of instruction for our students. This email highlights a few important updates and reminders about making remote instruction as reliable as possible.
 Choose the lowest bandwidth option possible
Our students do not all have reliable, high speed internet access. Nationwide, many users are experiencing degraded internet service as networks are struggling to serve increased home internet and streaming usage. Whenever possible, try to use text, audio or video instead of synchronous content. Live Zoom sessions should only be used for office hours or smaller classes that require student interaction. See the Keep Teaching resources page for guides on creating video lectures and information on how to get one-on-one support. Please try to be accommodating if you have students with connectivity issues.
If you are planning on using Proctorio for exam proctoring, we recommend doing a practice test at least a week in advance to allow students to test out their configurations. Internet upload speeds are different than download speeds; students who are used to expedient downloading of course materials may struggle with the Proctorio service, as it is reliant on upload speed.
Check your Zoom security settings
If you are using Zoom, please make sure you have updated the Zoom security settings for your sessions and are aware of how to manage disrupters. The campus is taking Zoom disruption incidents very seriously and trying to make sure our learning environments are not disrupted by explicit content and hate speech. As of March 31, 2020, all newly created Zoom meetings require a password by default. Meeting organizers and course instructors will need to share passwords with attendees ahead of Zoom meetings.
Refer students with access issues to the Student Assistance Center
The campus has sent multiple messages to students regarding available resources for internet access, loaner laptops and webcams. Despite these messages, some students still may not be aware of ways the university can help them access their remote classes. Please refer students in need of such support to the Student Assistance Center by encouraging them to email helpdean@illinois.edu. Student email requests are answered promptly and tracked until the issue is resolved. We have already shipped out dozens of loaner devices to students and assisted many students with connecting to free internet services from major providers.
Again, thank you for all you have done to ensure the continuity  of our campus educational mission in these unprecedented circumstances.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

        Dear Members of the University Community,
In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and continued guidance from both local and state health officials, we have made the decision that all Summer 2020 courses will be conducted remotely via alternative delivery mechanisms.
We know that this decision about summer courses may generate additional questions about summer research, programs, travel, housing, events, remote work protocols, etc. We are not ready to make those decisions at this time, but as soon as we are ready, you will be notified.
More details about Summer 2020 courses 
Registration for Summer session begins on April 20, 2020. Additional information regarding dates and deadlines may be found here. The Summer Financial Aid application will be available on the Office of Student Financial Aid website on April 20.
The Office of the Registrar will be contacting departments and academic programs to aid in modifying summer offerings as appropriate. Our priority is to provide as many opportunities as possible for students to continue progression towards their degree. 
Faculty that would like support in preparing their course for remote instruction can contact the Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning (CITL).
As you know, we have already announced that all Summer 2020 Study Abroad programs will be suspended.
Thank you all for your continued patience and passion for this university as we navigate this unprecedented time together.

          Dear students, faculty, staff and friends:
So much has been asked of you over the last few weeks in the push to stem the spread of the COVID-19 virus.
Many of you have been uprooted, disrupted and distanced from family, friends and colleagues. You have transitioned into a world that is suddenly more virtual than personal, sacrificing many of the daily rhythms and joys of life.
You have responded with remarkable understanding, compassion and commitment. And at this critical stage in the effort, as Governor Pritzker extends his stay-at-home order through the end of April, please don’t let your guard down.
Experts say the coming weeks could bring the payoff for everything you are doing – a peak in cases that will hopefully shift the tide of the pandemic. So keep staying close to home. Keep up the social distancing. Keep washing your hands and covering coughs and sneezes. Keep watching out for each other. All of our efforts now will help our campus communities, our state and our nation return to the lives we cherish.

                March 31, 2020 12:28 PM

        Dear Students,
April 1, 2020 is Census Day, the once-a-decade count of every person living in the United States on that day. With the disruptions in your daily lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic and many of you temporarily living away from Urbana-Champaign, you may be confused about where you should be counted.
The official guidance from the US Census Bureau is that university students affected by the COVID-19 disruptions should still be counted where you lived while at the university. It is important you are counted in the US Census at the address where you would have been living and sleeping most of the time on April 1, 2020, prior to COVID-19 changes.
Here is what you need to know to ensure that you are counted at the correct address in the 2020 Census.
If you are currently living on campus in University Housing, Private Certified Housing or a Fraternity/Sorority House, or lived there before spring break, you will be counted by the university. There is nothing you need to do.
If you are living in an off-campus apartment or house, Ashton Woods, Goodwin-Green, or Orchard Downs—or lived there before spring break—you will need to complete the Census form.
If you are currently living in the Champaign-Urbana area, you should respond to the Census using your current local address where you are living and sleeping most of the time on April 1, 2020.
If you are temporarily living at another location due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but were living in an off-campus apartment or house, Ashton Woods, Goodwin-Green, or Orchard Downs before spring break, you should respond to the Census using the address where you were living and sleeping most of the time before spring break, prior to COVID-19 changes.
For international students attending the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it is important that you also are counted. The US Census is a count of every person living in the United States on April 1, 2020. Please follow the guidance above, regardless of your home country or where you are now currently living after spring break.
For additional information about how to complete your form, Student Affairs has created a website for the 2020 Census to help you through the process. Please see the Off-Campus Housing FAQ page and the Ashton Woods, Goodwin-Green, and Orchard Downs FAQ page for details. All information that you submit is confidential and protected by federal law. Your identifiable information will not be released to others, including businesses and law enforcement agencies. You can learn more about the Census and why it is important that you are counted in the right place by watching this video from the US Census Bureau.
Census results are very important. They help determine how billions of dollars in federal funding flow into states and communities each year, including money for Federal Pell grants, agriculture, science and engineering education, student wellness programs and community mental health services. The results also determine how many seats in Congress each state gets.
Please visit go.illinois.edu/census2020 for more information about how you can complete the Census. No matter where you are temporarily living, your response to the Census is critical for the Urbana-Champaign community and the State of Illinois.

Robert J. JonesChancellor"
2020-03-31T07:14:00Z,2020-03-31,7:14,55558,ISG: Transgender Day of Visibility (3/31) & LGBTQ+ Day of...,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/7570252.html,"-- This message is being sent by the Illinois Student Government LBGBTQ+ Advocacy Task Force through the office of the Illinois Student Government President Connor Josellis. --
Dear Illini,
We are writing to you in the midst of these hard times to highlight two dates which are very significant to the LGBTQ+ population, not only on campus, but worldwide. One being Transgender Day of Visibility on March 31st and the other being LGBTQ+ Day of Silence on April 24th.
We wanted to send you all a reminder of these events to highlight some of the most marginalized communities at the University of Illinois. Even though LGBTQ+ people make up approximately 15.9% of our students, the campus LGBTQ+ community has largely remained unseen.[1] On this campus, LGBTQ+ students in 2019 reported nearly twice as many incidents of gender harassment, cyber harassment, stalking, and dating violence. LGBTQ+ students on campus face more academic disengagement and have higher rates of psychological distress.[1]LGBTQ+ people also face unique struggles due to the fact that many are staying in unaccepting spaces during this quarantine period. Finally, LGBTQ+ students in the UIUC community face more academic disengagement and much higher rates of psychological distress.[1] 
Transgender Day of Visibility serves to celebrate transgender people from around the world and raise awareness about the violence and discrimination that the transgender community faces on a daily basis.[2] 
[Content Warning: discussion of the murders of trans people]
In the United States over 26 trans people were murdered in 2019. The vast majority of these individuals were Black and Hispanic trans women, who tend to experience a greater degree of marginalization. At least 4 trans people were killed so far in 2020. The names of these individuals are: Dustin Parker, Alexa Negrón Luciano, Yampi Méndez Arocho, and lastly Monika Diamond, who was murdered just two weeks ago on March 18th. In all four murders, the trans victims have been deadnamed (called the name assigned to them before their transition), misgendered, and misrepresented by the media. In three of the four murders, the killers have gone unpunished. 
The LGBTQ Day of Silence, organized by GLSEN, is an annual day of action where members of the LGBTQ+ community and their allies take a vow of silence to bring attention to the struggles faced by the community, particularly within academic environments. This silence is meant to represent the silencing that LGBTQ+ students face nearly everyday. At the end of the day, participants are encouraged to “break the silence”, by attending a rally or performing LGBTQ+ activism.
The LGBTQ+ Day of Silence allows us to reflect on what we and those around us are doing to either silence or give voice to the LGBTQ+ community in spaces such as classes, departments, and the university as a whole. 
In light of the cancellation of classes, an alternative to being publicly silent to demonstrate could be to make a social media post encouraging others to read about the history of the Day of Silence or to make a donation to GLSEN, The Trevor Project, or another LGBTQ+ organization. We invite you to share these Day of Silence Speaking Cards, which was created by GLSEN to inform and educate other members of your community about the LGBTQ+ Day of Silence. 
A critical aspect of LGBTQ+ culture is the concept of chosen families. This refers to situations where an LGBTQ+ individual finds many other members of the LGBTQ+ community to rely on for support, validation, and comfort. Many of our LGBTQ+ friends are now facing isolation from these integral support systems. We encourage you to support your classmates and friends through this crisis. We are stronger together.
If you have any questions about ways to support the LGBTQ+ community, we encourage you to reach out the resources listed below:

If you aren’t part of the LGBTQ+ community, think of how you can be a better ally to the people around you. In addition, we encourage you to reach out and engage with the various groups and services associated with our LGBT Resource Center which you can learn more about at https://oiir.illinois.edu/lgbt-resource-center.

Thank you!
That sums up everything else we will say in this note.
Thank you for your patience, your hard work, your creativity and the care you have demonstrated in these intense and difficult times.
In a matter of days, you have stepped up in an exemplary way to allow us to continue to move forward delivering on our missions in a world that feels like it has been turned upside down by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
This has put new demands on every single member of this university family.
Most of you have had to relocate where you work or study and to rethink how you engage with one another.
A number of you have been challenged to find new, safe ways to perform the essential services on our campus that all of us depend upon.
And all of us are doing our best in learning how to live and work together in a time when the health and safety of our communities depends on our personal separation from each other.
We understand how enormously difficult this has been. Operationally, we had a very good first week in these unprecedented times. But as we adjust to these extraordinary circumstances, we also ask that you all take the time you need to think about and address your emotional and mental wellness. We have support resources for students and for our staff and faculty. We encourage you to call upon these resources without hesitation.
We often say that the people who come through this university regularly do things that require the world to redefine “impossible.” You have proven that to be true once again.
At the beginning of this semester, “impossible” is exactly how most would have described what you all, working together, accomplished last week.
Wherever you might be reading this today, we thank you.

In order to ensure the best educational experiences for you, we have implemented some new policies for Spring 2020 full-semester and second eight-week courses. These policies are in effect for both undergraduate and graduate courses. These policies were developed in close consultation with faculty, students, staff and the Academic Senate.
These academic policies will allow you some choices as you navigate this semester. You will be receiving more specific guidance from your instructors and your department in the days to come. You will have plenty of time to make any decisions that might be necessary. But we want you to have this information now as you begin this final half of a very unexpected semester. 
The deadline to drop a full-semester course has been changed to April 30, 2020.
For full-semester and second eight-week courses, you will be given the option to select the “credit/no-credit” (CR/NC) grading option as outlined in the Student Code. The following modifications to the CR/NC grading will be in effect for the Spring 2020 semester only.
You have until April 30, 2020, to elect CR/NC grading.
Courses taken with CR/NC may be used to fulfill major, minor and General Education requirements.
There is no limit on the number of courses selected for CR/NC.

For a small number of courses that must significantly alter their assessment strategy, instructors may request a switch away from standard course grading (A/B/C/D/F) to “pass/no-pass” (PA/NP) grading for their course. This option is only anticipated for courses where the assessment modification makes it difficult to fairly assign letter grades.
If a course is approved for PA/NP grading, all students will be assessed using the same pass/no-pass criteria. There is no option for students to select standard grading.
Your instructor will let you know in the near future if your course is converted to PA/NP grading.

Deadlines for student actions:
The deadline to drop a full semester course (without a W) is now April 30.
The deadline to select CR/NC grading is now April 30 (see above).
The deadline to utilize Campus Grade Replacement option is now April 30. Students who previously selected a course for grade replacement may now retract their prior request.

Other important dates for continuing students:
Time-tickets for Summer 2020 and Fall 2020 registration will be released on April 6.
Registration for Summer 2020 will begin on April 20.
Registration for Fall 2020 will begin on April 20.

Students and courses in professional programs (College of Law, Carle Illinois College of Medicine and the College of Veterinary Medicine) are excluded from these temporary academic policy modifications.
Colleges and departments have agreed to work with those of you who were expecting or require graded courses for career or certification purposes. We promise CR/NC and PA/NP grading will not affect your status as a student at Illinois. 
We are seeing a growing number of our peer institutions implementing similar policies for this semester, and we expect external stakeholders (e.g., graduate schools, employers) to recognize the unique nature of this semester. We are extending these deadlines to give you more time to make informed choices to try to lessen your stress.
If you do not have proper technology equipment to continue your studies remotely, please contact the Student Assistance Center in the Office of the Dean of Students right away. They can work to supply you with internet access, laptops, hardware and anything else you might need.
I know this adjustment to our policies is neither ideal nor is it a course of action we would ever consider in any normal circumstances. But, in this unprecedented time, we believe these actions are the best way to deliver an educational experience that is fair and academically sound.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

We have been listening actively to the questions, concerns and suggestions you have offered to ensure we can deliver on the educational objectives we promise in ways that are fair to our students and allow you the greatest flexibility.
In response to what you have asked, and in consultation with the Academic Senate, we are implementing the following academic policies for Spring 2020 full-semester and second eight-week courses. These policies will apply to both graduate and undergraduate courses. These policies were developed in close consultation with faculty, students, staff and the Academic Senate. The deadline to drop a full-semester course (without grade of W) has been changed to April 30, 2020.
Students will be given the option to select a “credit/no-credit” (CR/NC) grading option as outlined in the Student Code. The following modifications to the CR/NC grading will be in effect for the Spring 2020 semester only.
Students have until April 30, 2020, to elect CR/NC grading for any course.
Courses taken with CR/NC may be used to fulfill major, minor and General Education requirements.

For a small number of courses that must significantly alter their assessment strategy, instructors may request a switch away from standard course grading (A/B/C/D/F) to “pass/no-pass” (PA/NP) grading for their course. This option is anticipated to be used only for courses where the assessment modification makes it difficult to fairly assign letter grades. We note that the addition of a campus license for Proctorio™ for online exam proctoring should help courses continue with much of their normal assessment strategies.
In the request to make the course PA/NP, the instructor must explain how and why standard course grading is not feasible for their course.
This change must be approved by department head/chair and;
If a course is approved for PA/NP grading, all students will be assessed using the same pass/no-pass criteria. There is no “opt out” for students to select standard grading.
We strongly recommend that multi-section courses be consistent in their application of this grading scheme.
Additional information will be forthcoming on the process to request a course be switched from traditional to pass/no-pass grading.

The grading modifications outlined above are designed to give all of you with instructional responsibilities the maximum flexibility as you navigate this unique and extremely difficult situation. As a reminder, for regularly graded courses, instructors submit grades for all students as normal. For students who have selected CR/NC grading, their letter grade will be converted in Banner to CR (C- and above) or NC (D or below) automatically.
Students and courses in professional programs (College of Law, Carle Illinois College of Medicine and the College of Veterinary Medicine) are excluded from these temporary academic policy modifications.
This semester will be unique in many ways. Our campus units recognize the issues–and will not penalize students–for courses graded as CR/NC or PA/NP. Departmental and college advising offices will work with students to ensure they understand the options, benefits and potential drawbacks of CR/NC grading.
A growing number of our peer institutions are implementing similar policies for this semester, and we expect external stakeholders (e.g., graduate schools, employers) to recognize the unique nature of this semester. However, we cannot guarantee that all will do so. As a consequence, we continue to recommend that instructors and students consider these factors when advising students and when contemplating any changes to your course grading scheme.
You are the experts here. We trust you to do what is best for your students.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

With most of the campus buildings locked, departments will not be generating letters and parcels to deliver to other campus locations. A few offices have made special arrangements for critical items to be delivered. If you or your department has a critical need for transportation of campus mail or processing of outgoing US Mail, please contact Campus Mail at printing@illinois.edu and we will make arrangements. Outgoing mail that needs to be metered requires a pink barcode sticker or a CFOAPAL to which the postage can be charged.
While the campus is following Governor Pritzker’s order to stay at home, please do not put campus mail that you need delivered in any campus mailboxes except the one outside the Turner Student Services Building located at 610 E John St, Champaign. We will be checking this box on Tuesdays and Thursdays and delivering only to buildings that are open.
As a reminder, Campus Mail handles only intracampus mail and outgoing US mail that needs to be metered. The United States Postal Service (USPS) handles all incoming and stamped outgoing US mail. For US mail, the United States Postal Service (USPS) carriers will deliver mail to offices that are accessible. If you wish to forward or stop your US mail, you will need to contact USPS at 800-275-8777 or usps.com.
Campus Mail does not control deliveries that are made by commercial shippers. If you are expecting deliveries from or need to ship items with UPS, FedEx, or other commercial carriers, you should contact them directly to make arrangements; UPS can be contacted through ups.com and FedEx can be contacted through fedex.com.

As we begin the final weeks of a semester disrupted by this unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, I want to share this short video message with all of you. 
I do not pretend that things will be easy.
The classes you have designed or chosen to take will be delivered in alternative ways. Your research and scholarly work may be disrupted, as you develop new and creative ways to move your project forward. In some cases, you might be performing essential duties that can only be done on campus, while others are working remotely. And for the foreseeable future this university will be a place where almost all of our faculty, staff and students are separated by unexpected distance. This is a distance that we will overcome through our shared compassion for each other.
The weeks to come will bring all of us challenges of many different kinds whether academic, professional or personal. I encourage you to look for support when you need it. And I encourage you to lend your support to friends or coworkers or even complete strangers when you see that they need it.
I am confident that when we have come through this, we will look back and see the resiliency of our university community was exceeded only by our care for one another when it mattered most.
Wherever you might be today, you are always a member of the Illinois family.

2020-03-21T17:21:00Z,2020-03-21,17:21,8493,Guidance to Define Critical and Essential Research,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/5295343.html,"Dear Colleagues:
As you are undoubtedly aware, late yesterday the Governor issued an executive order for all individuals living in Illinois to stay at home, effective at 5 p.m. today. The order included an exemption for educational institutions performing “critical research,” provided that social distancing of six feet per person is maintained to the greatest extent possible.
Over the past several weeks, as COVID-19 has escalated across the globe, we have been preparing contingency plans across campus and in the field to ramp-down/shut-down non-essential research activities, in consultation with unit executive officers and facility managers of research infrastructure and equipment. Because of this contingency planning, many of our research investigators have already elected to work remotely and to ramp-down or shut-down non-essential activities on site, particularly when they felt that they could not maintain safe social distancing (6 feet) in their research environments.
Effective immediately, Saturday, March 21, per the Governor’s order and in compliance with campus guidance from the Chancellor and Provost, all research activities on campus, in the field, and at auxiliary sites must now ramp down to conduct only essential activities. This means that most campus research labs, facilities, and field sites should cease in-person operations—safely— with consideration during ramp-down of requirements to effectively ramp back up to resume activities when allowed.
Research and scholarly activities that can be continued remotely are strongly encouraged.
With the requirement that effective social distancing (6 ft) can be maintained, essential research-related activities that require campus and field sites are defined as follows: 
Work that directly relates to preventing, containing, or treating the COVID-19 pandemic
Work that is directly related to national security
Research support functions that are required by law
Work to maintain critical equipment, whether in stand-by mode or operational
Work to maintain critical biological or material samples and animal populations
Seasonally dependent agricultural research with critical implications for human and animal health, as well as food security
Laboratory or field work where discontinuation would result in loss of significant data and samples
Longitudinal or seasonal work where discontinuation would result in loss of significant data and samples
Experiments, projects, and studies that do not fit these categories must ramp down immediately and cease. Executive Officers in your unit, school, institute, and college should be consulted for clarifications that are discipline-specific. If further clarification is required, then Institute Directors or Associate Deans of Research can direct inquiries to ovcr@illinois.edu.
Research personnel and their supervisors who are expected to carry out essential research activities should refer to guidance that was issued on Friday, March 20. 
Remote research and scholarly activities are strongly encouraged. Many research and scholarly activities can be continued remotely and should be supported by regular electronic and virtual contact with research groups. Alternate approaches for research personnel working remotely might include data analysis, preparation and review, presentation preparation, proposal development, and grant report preparation. Do not, however, remove university chemicals, equipment, or animals in an attempt to recreate your labs at off-site locations. Research personnel should not use office spaces on campus for activities that may be conducted remotely.
Next Steps for Principal Investigators and Research Personnel:
Immediately: Determine if any of your lab or field activities meet the definition of essential.
For Supervisors: Specifically inform members of your research teams if they are considered essential. As per guidance from the Chancellor and Provost, unit heads of each department that has essential employees who are required to report to a campus or field location must download this spreadsheet template, name the file UNIT/ESSENTIALPERSONNEL/DATE, fill it out and email to ihr@illinois.edu by Wednesday, March 25. 
Use the DRS ramp-down checklist to shut down your non-essential research operations, so that they may be effectively resumed when allowed.
Access to lab, facilities, and field sites will be available only for personnel who conduct essential related activities or are ramping down to shut-down non-essential research operations.
Essential work should be staggered so that minimal personnel are present in the research environment at any one time. Social distancing of at least six feet should be maintained.
Maintain contact information for your students, postdocs, and staff, and review contingency plans and emergency procedures within your group.
OVCRI offices that support research have remote-work plans in place and remain operational. Please know that the OVCRI stands by to support your research activities during these unprecedented times. Your patience, cooperation, flexibility, and dedication are appreciated as we work together through the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) today announced two separate confirmed cases of COVID-19 in our university community. Both individuals are employees. The first was last on campus on March 13. That individual was tested on March 15, received medical treatment and has been in self-quarantine at home since that time. CUPHD has traced the activities of the individual prior to the self-quarantine and contacted the students, employees and community members who may have been in close proximity to the individual. But in this case, the CUPHD believes the risk of transmission is very low. The second employee was tested on March 18. In this case, CUPHD reports this individual has not had any contact with others, is in self-quarantine and the risk of transmission is very low. Federal health privacy laws prevent us from sharing any other information about individuals who have tested positive. 
We are told both individuals are recovering at home and our thoughts are with them at this time.
These are the first confirmed cases on campus involving members of the university community, and we thought it was important to share this information today. Additionally, an Illini Alert will be sent on this issue in compliance with Clery Act federal reporting regulations. CUPHD has told us to expect more confirmed cases in the days and weeks to come. Going forward, we will make updates about future cases directly to covid19.illinois.edu, and CUPHD will directly contact any individuals who might have been at risk of exposure by being in the immediate area of newly diagnosed people.
Please continue to check covid19.illinois.edu regularly for current information and resources.   
We continue to follow the guidance from public health experts and state officials to take steps to reduce the density of our campus population to allow for greater social distancing and to make the environment safer for those who remain here. Our transition to alternative course delivery will begin on Monday and a large majority of our employees have already transitioned to working remotely. We are working with unit leadership to make any necessary arrangements to comply with Gov. Pritzker’s Stay At Home order for essential employees.  
These are our first confirmed cases with a campus connection. With the rapid spread of COVID-19 and rise in reported cases around our state and nation, this is not an unexpected event. But that does not make today’s announcement any less upsetting. And based on predictions by public health officials, we are likely to see more cases among our campus and local community.
We will keep you informed of new information as we learn of it. And we will continue to do all we can to keep our students, faculty, staff and community members as safe as possible.

As you likely have heard, Governor Pritzker today issued a stay-at-home order for Illinois residents and a corresponding University System-wide massmail was sent.
It is important to note that the governor’s order allows universities to continue essential functions, including “facilitating distance learning, performing critical research, or performing essential functions, provided that social distancing of six-feet per person is maintained to the greatest extent possible.”
We want to follow up with some more specific information for our students, faculty and staff about how today’s shelter-in-place order will impact our operations.
For students and families who are moving out of University Housing and are making plans for your check-out, the shelter-in-place order means that we need to suspend that process starting Saturday, March 21 at 2 p.m. until the order is lifted. Housing will reach out to you to provide information on the resumption of move-out.
For all students, graduate and undergraduate, as well as others who will be remaining in University Housing residence halls or apartments or in private residences locally, nothing has changed. We ask you to follow the social distancing guidelines in place now and to plan to begin your coursework through alternative delivery Monday morning.
For all faculty and staff and graduate employees (TAs, RAs, GAs) please continue to follow the guidance about your working arrangements you have already received through Illinois Human Resources, your colleges and your departments, including guidance on whether you will be able to use university classrooms and facilities to present your course material. We are working to put in place new emergency procedures and policies regarding university pay and benefits to comply with the governor’s order and to protect all of our employees.
We know for many that this is another unsettling development. But we are working together to navigate it.
Thank you all for your contributions to ensuring that we can continue to fulfill our missions of learning, discovery and engagement, and thank you for your patience and all of your efforts to approach this crisis with calm and with respect and care for each other.

Dear faculty, staff and students:
Today, Gov. J.B. Pritzker issued a stay-at-home order for residents of Illinois, part of the state’s ongoing efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19. The order will be in effect through April 7 to keep people home as much as possible and minimize the person-to-person contact that has fueled the global pandemic.
Because of actions we have taken to date, the governor’s order is very consistent with what we are already doing. Faculty and students are transitioning to online and alternative learning mechanisms for the rest of the semester and many of our employees are already working remotely. It has been a herculean effort and we are grateful to all members of our campus communities who have worked so hard to enact such a swift changeover.  
Going forward, we will add the following to comply with the new order:
Employees will work remotely other than those in essential jobs defined in the order, such as police, healthcare workers, power plant operators, and housing and dining personnel. Employees who have specific questions about whether this announcement changes their current working arrangement should ask their supervisor.
Unless in essential jobs, faculty and staff should stay at home except when pursuing essential activities related to healthcare, pharmacy and grocery shopping, gas stations, banking, drive-through and carry-out restaurants, and home-based care for children and seniors.
Students, we are here for you and we are so proud of you! Please help us prevent transmission by staying in your residence halls, apartments, and permanent homes as much as possible while we clamp down on this virus. And use the technologies that you are so good at to stay connected to our universities.
Now, let’s keep showing the way. Our healthcare professionals at UIC and across the state are on the front lines, caring for patients while addressing the epidemic. Faculty across our three universities are sharing their expertise with the Governor’s Office, including an Urbana-Champaign epidemiological study that demonstrates how heightened social distancing can slow the outbreak and prevent a shortage of intensive-care unit beds across the state. In fact, Gov. Pritzker has praised the U of I System’s contributions, which also include providing up-to-date research on the control of infectious diseases, emergency preparedness and public health.
All of you share the credit. Thank you for your concern and compassion for each other and for embracing our collective responsibility to curb the spread of the virus across this state that we are so proud to serve.

The COVID 19 pandemic has broadly impacted all sectors of our society, including the research, discovery, innovation, and scholarly activities that are one of the mission cornerstones of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. We know that our scholars are faced with continuing their research activities under disrupted circumstances, while embracing creative approaches. The following guidance for implementation of social distancing and remote work is aimed at reducing the density of the campus population and lowering the risk of exposure to those who remain engaged in research in our facilities, laboratories, and field sites.
Guidance for supervisors and advisors of research personnel, including post-docs, technicians, and graduate students. It is a challenging period for all of our employees and students. UIUC currently remains open for research requiring infrastructure that is only accessible on campus or in the field. It is essential that best practices be followed by researchers who continue to work in their usual environment. This includes staying home if one is not feeling well or if a person in your home is not feeling well; adhering to social distancing (6 feet) while in research labs, core facilities, agricultural plots and buildings, and/or in the field; as well as following CDC guidelines to regularly disinfect work spaces. (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/cleaning-disinfection.html) 
Some of the members of your research group are very likely to feel anxiety about coming to work for many reasons. It is critical that you have a private conversation with each of your researchers to identify those who are concerned and encourage them to stay home and work remotely. In these cases, please work as appropriate to develop alternate work activities if they are unable to access essential infrastructure for their normal scope of work.  
Employees might also experience significant anxiety if they cannot access critical facilities to carry out their research project and activities. Again, this might be for many reasons, including pending dissertation deadlines, critical longitudinal timelines, seasonal—dependent research, etc. It is very important that you identify each individual’s concerns and determine whether and how they may be mitigated by revising work plans and developing new timelines.
Guidance for research personnel, including post-docs, technicians, and graduate students. It is a challenging period for researchers as they face projects that might be encumbered with significant expectations, timelines and/or deadlines, while adapting to the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic. If you are continuing to work in your normal university work environment, it is essential that you follow best practices for the safety of yourselves and your co-workers. These include staying home if you are not feeling well or if a person in your home is not feeling well; adhering to social distancing (6 feet) while in research labs, core facilities, agricultural plots and buildings, and/or in the field; and following CDC guidelines to regular disinfect work spaces. (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/cleaning-disinfection.html) 
It is critical to understand that if you are uncomfortable, for any reason, working in your normal work environment—whether it is in a research facility, wet lab, or in the field—that you have the right to work from home. For those whose research activities do not readily adapt to working from home, your advisor/supervisor will assist you to define alternate activities and/or assignments that can be carried out remotely. Alternate assignments will be assigned without adverse academic, employment, or financial consequences. In the case that you cannot reach a satisfactory agreement with your supervisor, please contact as a first step:
Head or Chair of your Department
Director of your interdisciplinary institute
Director of Graduate Studies (DGS) of your Department
Alternative contacts would include the Associate Dean of Research or Academic Affairs in your College, Alexis Thompson (athmpsn1@illinois.edu) in the Graduate College, or Sue Key (susankey@illinois.edu; Human Resources) in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation.
We know that the COVID-19 pandemic and all the circumstances surrounding it are disruptive.
Rapidly evolving information and impact coupled with real time decision-making at the local, state, national, and global levels are stressful for every person at our university.
It is an incredibly unsettling time, and more questions will undoubtedly arise. We will provide answers and details as directly, transparently, and quickly as we can.
We understand that we are asking all of you to help us face a challenge of a scale and magnitude that has rarely before been seen here at our university and are grateful for your flexibility and patience.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost

We are very disappointed to share the news that commencement ceremonies will not take place as scheduled in May at our universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Diplomas will be mailed, and we are exploring possible alternatives such as rescheduling and/or hosting virtual events to honor the Class of 2020. You will hear more from leadership of your universities in the days and weeks to come.
This was an outcome we had hoped to avoid. Commencements reflect the very core of our mission and provide a richly deserved celebration for both our graduates and the proud parents, family, friends, faculty and staff who supported them along the way. Every year, ceremonies across the U of I System draw anywhere from a few hundred people at school- and college-based commencements to more than 20,000 at Urbana’s university-wide event.
Even small turnouts, however, would far exceed the guidance issued last weekend by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to slow the spread of the virus. The new guidelines call for canceling or postponing all large gatherings for at least the next eight weeks – a timeline that brings us within days of our May commencements.
We know you share the goal of those restrictions – protecting yourselves and the well-being of your family, friends and the broader community, particularly the most vulnerable among us. We are proud of your sacrifice and your success, Class of 2020, and we promise we will find ways to honor your achievements.

2020-03-16T18:10:00Z,2020-03-16,18:10,35537,COVID-19: Suspension of face-to-face instruction through...,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/8765263.html,"Dear students,
Earlier today you received a message from Chancellor Robert Jones announcing that we are suspending face-to-face instruction for the rest of the semester. This message provides additional information about this transition; please read it carefully. We know this announcement generated many questions. Thank you for your patience as we worked through details of how to make this extraordinarily difficult transition as smooth as possible under the circumstances. Please continue to read your email regularly.
First and foremost, your health, safety and wellness are the absolute highest priority. Please understand that the current situation is unprecedented, university faculty and staff are working hard to ensure your safety, and we are doing all that we can to support continuity of academic instruction. We will do our best to be flexible and accommodating.
Below are some specific details about our transition away from face-to-face instruction:
Face-to-face instruction is suspended beginning March 23 through the end of the spring 2020 semester.
Campus will remain open. However, many physical services on the campus and throughout the community will be limited in operations. So, we are instructing any students who can safely return to their permanent home for the rest of the semester do so. 
We understand that some students will have the need to return to campus and they may do so.
At this time, we plan for essential campus academic facilities (library, computer labs, etc…) to remain open, in some cases on a limited basis, to provide students with options to access online course materials.
We are following the advice of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public health officials to reduce the density of the population in our facilities and make the environment safer for those who must remain on campus.
If you do not have access to technology that will allow you to engage in remote instruction, please contact the Student Assistant Center in the Office of the Dean of Students.
If you have specific questions or concerns about technology, please contact Technology Services for assistance with technology-specific questions.

You will continue to receive updates from the campus, your home college and your instructors through your campus email address. It is essential that you regularly check this account and read important updates from different campus units.
Instructors are working to move face-to-face courses to alternative delivery methods.
Full-semester courses will continue through alternative delivery starting March 23.
For each class in which you are enrolled, you will receive an email from your instructor before the class is scheduled to meet again. This email will give you information about how the course will be administered going forward.
There will be no additional charges or fees associated with alternative delivery modes.
Full-semester courses that were already offered via fully online delivery will continue as planned.

Second eight-week (part of term B) courses will begin following the schedule as established in the Class Schedule starting March 23.
We are adding additional second eight-week courses as well as additional seats to existing courses.
The deadline to add a second eight-week course is March 27.

If your instructor needs additional time to transition to an alternative delivery method, you will receive a message informing you of any specific class cancellation.
As noted in a previous message, the drop deadline for full-semester courses has been extended to Friday, March 27.
If you have questions or concerns about any of your current classes, about the possibility of adding a second eight-week course or how any of this impacts your academic standing and progress toward a degree, please contact the undergraduate office in your home college.
Finally, please continue to visit covid19.illinois.edu for the most up-to-date and comprehensive information.
We understand that our semester has taken a trajectory that is quite different than we were all expecting.  We know that every question or concern will not be resolved immediately. But our entire faculty and staff are working hard to ensure that you are safe and that your education can continue.  Thanks for your patience and understanding.
Please remain safe and practice social distancing. It helps to protect yourself and your community.
Sincerely,
Andreas CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

We have decided to suspend face-to-face instruction for the rest of the spring 2020 semester. This is following the advice of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public health officials to reduce the density of the population in our facilities and make the environment safer for those who must remain on campus. We still intend to resume instruction using these new delivery methods beginning Monday, March 23. However, individual instructors who need a bit more time to transition are, as always, authorized to cancel an individual class.
The suspension of face-to-face instruction for the remainder of the semester allows students to make solid plans to remain away from campus for the rest of the term. And it provides our faculty and instructional staff more clarity as we ask so many of you to redesign your course delivery under extraordinarily difficult circumstances.
We know this situation is stressful and unsettling for our students, staff and faculty. As you work to utilize alternative forms of delivery for your course materials, we urge you to be mindful of the challenges our students will face as they attempt to complete the semester through remote instruction. Instructors might find information provided here helpful in your migration from face-to-face delivery.
We are also working with our colleges to identify and remove administrative or logistical barriers to make it easier for our faculty and instructional staff to adjust their course-delivery practices in ways that will help our students engage and succeed. We want to give instructors the resources and flexibility to provide the outstanding educational experience Illinois promises our students. And we want to find ways to make it easy to put fairness and compassion into evaluative decisions. 
We are working through academic policy details associated with the transition away from face-to-face instruction. We will be consulting with the Academic Senate and communicating with instructional faculty and staff as these policies are finalized. 
Thanks for your work to ensure our students have continuity in their academic experience. We understand that the quickly evolving situation is challenging for everyone. The health and wellness of our campus community remains our highest priority.
We know we are asking you to take on an enormous additional responsibility to continue providing the certainty of a world-class education while everything else seems to be changing daily. I am confident that our students are in the very best hands possible.
With gratitude,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"
2020-03-16T17:48:00Z,2020-03-16,17:48,76084,COVID-19: No more face-to-face instruction and students...,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/1709761.html,"Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
We are taking steps to follow current guidance by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public health officials related to the practice of social distancing to slow the spread of COVID-19 disease. We are implementing significant new actions to maintain academic operations while reducing the density of the population in our facilities to make the environment safer for those who must remain on campus.
We are suspending face-to-face instruction for the rest of the spring 2020 semester.
We still intend to resume instruction using alternative delivery methods beginning Monday, March 23. Faculty and students will receive separate e-mail messages from Provost Andreas Cangellaris with more details about the transition. These updates also will be posted to the university's COVID-19 website.
We are requiring all students who can safely do so return to their permanent home address to take their classes for the rest of the semester. University Housing is asking those students living in residence halls, Private Certified and Greek housing to begin making plans to move out.
Students with housing contracts will receive an e-mail message with details about this process and scheduling information directly from Vice Chancellor Danita Brown Young.
Students residing in Private Certified Housing (i.e. Bromley, Newman, Illini Tower, Stratford House etc.) and in Greek Houses should consult with their respective facility management to determine policies and processes for move-out.
Information regarding Commencement and other year-end celebrations will be shared at a later time. All other campus events for this semester, including those sponsored by student organizations, are cancelled.
These actions will be unsettling to many and generate new questions. As noted above, we will provide answers and details as directly and as quickly as we can. But we believe these actions will reduce the density of the campus population and reduce the risk of exposure to those who remain here.
But, there are two points I hope everyone takes away clearly from this message:
We are not closing our residence halls. But we are asking all students who can go elsewhere, do so. For those who cannot leave, we will work with you to ensure you will have a safe and supportive home here as you continue your studies.
The university is not closing down nor ceasing operations. We plan for our modified operations to continue as announced through various messages in the past few days. Alternative instruction will continue as scheduled, as will the delivery of university operations designated as essential by college and unit executives. Students, staff and faculty should continue to attend class, teach and work as scheduled. University research offices remain open and we have plans in place to minimize disruptions to the research enterprise. 
I know this is disruptive and the constantly changing local, state, national and global situation is stressful for every person at this university.
I understand that we are asking all of you to help us face a challenge of a scale and magnitude that has rarely before been seen here at our university.
I cannot tell you when we will come out on the other side of this outbreak. And there may be new changes or new announcements in response to changing circumstances in the days to come.
But I can promise you that we will communicate as openly, honestly and quickly as we can.
And I can most certainly express my enormous gratitude to every single member of this university and this community for your exceptional efforts in these extraordinary days.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"
2020-03-16T09:50:00Z,2020-03-16,9:50,38941,Statement on Continuity of Graduate Research and Graduate...,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/9195637.html,"COVID-19: Statement on Continuity of Graduate Research and Graduate Education
The campus recognizes the critical role that graduate students play in the function of a research university.  Graduate students participate in research, teaching, and scholarship. We are taking measures to support them in each of these areas.  Below we provide some guidance pertaining to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on graduate education, graduate employment, and the general health and wellbeing of graduate students.
Graduate Education:
Traditional classroom-based courses: Many graduate students are currently enrolled in traditional classroom-based courses. The campus will be suspending face-to-face course instruction after Spring Break. Face-to-face courses will be cancelled beginning March 23. Beginning as soon as possible after that date, most courses will be taught via alternative delivery approaches. Course instructors are responsible for contacting enrolled graduate students with instructions for how each course will be delivered. Information should be provided to students in need of special accommodations. Students who need accommodations or assistance with this transition should contact Disability Resources and Educational Services at +1-217-333-4603.
Dissertation and thesis research and related independent study courses: Many graduate students work closely with faculty on a variety of research-based academic experiences such as Independent Study, Thesis, and Dissertation Research.  Campus is not closed. Faculty, graduate students and staff may still come to campus as usual.  It is our expectation that graduate students will continue to work with their advisor on these projects.  Graduate students should be encouraged to contact their advisor or their department for additional advice regarding how to best continue to make progress in these educational experiences. 
Internships and Clinical Rotations: Students who are in the process of completing assigned internships or clinical rotations should contact their advisor or supervisor to discuss how to best continue to make progress in these educational experiences. 
Administration of qualifying exams, thesis defenses, and doctoral preliminary and final examinations:  Many graduate students are currently preparing to take qualifying, preliminary or final dissertation or thesis examinations.  These examinations are an extremely important component of the student's academic program and should proceed as planned if at all possible.   In recognition of the fact that some committee members and graduate students may not be able to attend these examinations in person, the Graduate College is relaxing the regulations pertaining to the conduct of these examinations.  Specifically, effective immediately, the Graduate College will allow preliminary and final examinations to take place fully online by temporarily waiving current policy requirements that at least the chair and one additional member participate on campus. Students who are planning to take these examinations in the near future are encouraged to reach out to their advisor and department for additional information.
Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Hourly Employees:
Graduate students are extremely valued members of our community and our university would not be able to function without their hard work and contributions.  It is our intention to continue to rely on the services provided by graduate students during the current situation.  Graduate students with appointments will continue to be paid and will remain eligible for any tuition waiver associated with their appointment. Below we provide some additional information pertaining to teaching assistants, research assistants, other graduate assistants, fellows, and hourly employees.
Teaching Assistants: The university is transitioning to online and alternative course delivery for traditional classroom-based courses. If a student is assigned to assist a faculty member as a TA or grader they will be expected to continue to assist with the course or courses to which they have been assigned.  TAs should contact the faculty member responsible for the course to which they have been assigned or their department for specific instructions for their assignment.  If a graduate student is assigned as the instructor of record for a course, the student should be contacted by the department or college with respect to providing advice about how best to ensure appropriate instructional continuity.
Research Assistants: Graduate students who are employed as research assistants will continue to work on the projects to which they have been assigned.  We recognize that due to the fluid and changing nature of the current situation, specific duties and responsibilities may change.  Research assistants are encouraged to reach out to their supervisor for additional instructions pertaining to their assignment.
Other Graduate Assistants: Many graduate students are assigned graduate assistantship responsibilities to support departmental, college, or central campus units in an administrative or service capacity. Graduate students will continue to work on the projects to which they have been assigned.  We recognize that due to the fluid and changing nature of the current situation, specific duties and responsibilities may change.  Graduate assistants are encouraged to reach out to their supervisor for additional instructions pertaining to their assignment.Fellows: Fellows will continue to receive monthly stipends in accordance with the terms of their fellowship.
Hourly Employees: Hourly employees are encouraged to check with their employing unit about any new arrangements moving forward.
Graduate Student Health and Wellbeing:
We know the uncertainty of this situation is challenging for everyone in different ways. Our goal is that our graduate students will be able to focus on their studies, their work, their wellness and their lives. We will provide them with the support and resources they need to enable this to happen.
Health and Wellness: The health and safety of our community is of paramount importance.  We recognize that in the coming weeks and months members of our community may become unwell and will not be able to come to the university.  The university has posted detailed guidance about how to respond to health challenges and how to seek assistance.  Graduate students are encouraged to reach out to their department or the Graduate College if they are in need of support or if they are unsure of what to do.  Additional information is available online at the Graduate College Need Help webpage and on the campus and Graduate College COVID-19 webpages.
Coping with Anxiety and Stress: The Counseling Center provides services to help students address many academic, relational, social, and emotional concerns. Students in need of services should be encouraged to contact the Counseling Center to make an appointment. The Mental Health Clinic at McKinley Health Center offers a variety of services to students seeking assistance with stress, including educational resources for strategies and relaxation techniques.
University-Sponsored Travel: The university is prohibiting all international travel on university-sponsored business including conferences for faculty, staff and students from March 16 until further notice. The university is limiting domestic travel for faculty, staff and students to pre-approved travel for essential university business including conferences. The university will offer assistance to address academic and financial issues and other challenges that might arise from this decision. Those who believe they have an essential business reason to travel can request a waiver through their unit leader (dean, vice provost, vice chancellor, etc.), but the expectation is such waivers will be rare. 
Research or Study Abroad: The university has cancelled all international Study Abroad for all students from March 14 to at least August 15. Students are encouraged to return to the United States or to their home country. The university will offer assistance to address academic and financial issues and other challenges that might arise from this decision. Study abroad educational experiences are life-long and life-changing; however, our top priority at this time is to ensure our students’ personal health and safety while ensuring they can continue to make academic progress.
Graduate students who are conducting research abroad are encouraged to return to the United States or to their home country. The university will offer assistance to address academic and financial issues and other challenges that might arise from this decision. Graduate students are encouraged to reach out to their faculty advisors.  Those who believe they have an essential reason to remain abroad can request a waiver through their unit leader (dean, vice provost, vice chancellor, etc.), but the expectation is such waivers will be rare.
Personal Travel: The university is strongly advising against all international and domestic air travel on personal business for faculty, staff and students, especially those with underlying health conditions. Anyone who travels to a CDC Level 2 or 3 region, whether for professional or personal reasons, will be required to self-quarantine off-campus for 14 days BEFORE returning to campus. More information about the Self-Quarantine Protocol can be found online.
University Sponsored Events and Meetings: The university is suspending all university-sponsored, in-person events and meetings in campus facilities, effective March 13. More specifically, gatherings of 50 or more attendees should be postponed or cancelled. Instead, if possible and as appropriate, organizers should explore alternative ways of conducting the event, e.g., livestreaming and conference calling.  The university recommends that all in-person meetings be moved to an alternative solution unless meeting in-person is essential to do so. If so, please observe CDC guidelines on social distancing and other preventative measures.
International Students: The university recognizes that this is a stressful time for our international students and that there is much uncertainty regarding travel at this point in time. The Office of International Student and Scholar Services is able to provide additional information and updates which are  posted on the International Student and Scholar Services website and the university’s COVID-19 webpage.

As we continue to address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the safety and wellbeing of our students, faculty and staff is our top priority. As we said when we announced the transition from face-to-face instruction, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises that everyone follow social distancing practices. We want to make sure you are aware that some university employees will be working remotely to ensure that those who need to be physically on campus will be able to avoid contact with others as much as possible. If you are a student employee, your supervisor will provide guidance to you.
I want to be clear, though, that does not mean faculty and staff will not be working. We will continue to provide support to you throughout this situation, and we will be available to assist you with services such as career counseling, mental health, financial aid questions and any other concerns you have. Please be advised that some services may be limited during this time. We strongly recommend calling or emailing the office or department before visiting. [https://directory.illinois.edu/departmentsUnits]
We understand this is a time of uncertainty, and we are doing everything possible to reduce the anxiety the situation is creating. We want you to be able to focus on your studies and your life.
Thank you for your patience as we transition to this new reality, and please remember that although we cannot all be together, we are still a community and showing kindness and compassion to each other will be the hallmark of our response to this outbreak.

2020-03-14T22:12:00Z,2020-03-14,22:12,30080,COVID-19: Remote work information,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/2064109.html,"Dear Faculty and Staff,
Earlier, we shared the following message with deans, directors and department heads. We want to share it with you as well, so everyone is clear on our remote work policy for addressing the challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak and the very critical need for everyone to follow the CDC guidelines on social distancing.
Your unit leadership and/or HR contact will be in touch with more specific details as soon as they are available. Thank you for your patience as we navigate this evolving issue.

Dear Deans, Directors and Department Heads,
As we continue to address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the safety and wellbeing of our students, faculty and staff is our top priority. You have likely been getting many questions about expectations for your employees, so we hope to address some of those concerns with this message.
It cannot be business as usual. But as we transition to this new operating environment, our students and others who depend on us for learning, discovery and engagement can have confidence that we are preparing to conduct business as unusual. While we continue the work of the university, we are finding new ways for many of our faculty and staff to continue their work while keeping themselves and our entire community safe.
Effective now, we are implementing protocols to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines on social distancing. We expect this will involve having some portion of our workforce to conduct business remotely, and we ask that you complete the transition to this temporary model by Wednesday, March 25.  Several factors have led us to make this decision. There have been increased recommendations from public health administrators to maintain social distancing procedures. This remote work environment should help reduce the burden on our local healthcare system, by allowing our employees to avoid unnecessary external contact. Governor Pritzker has also announced that all public and private K-12 schools will be closed until the end of March, and this new work policy also will help allow many of our employees and their families manage childcare while still being able to focus on their work.
To ensure you have flexibility to meet the needs of your unit, we are leaving specific decisions for implementing these policies to deans and unit executive officers. Unit leaders should base their specific decisions on the new COVID-19 Response Illinois Human Resources protocol. This document includes information that will help you make these important decisions. Further updates will be provided as they become available. We also will send an email to HR managers with more specific details.
We encourage you to be as creative, innovative and adaptable as possible to accommodate as many remote workers as possible. In short, when faced with the question of “May I allow this individual to work remotely?” we want you to do everything possible to answer, “Yes.”
This includes student employees and employees who have not previously been allowed to work remotely under ordinary circumstances. We are specifically and strongly encouraging units to find ways to provide opportunities to work remotely for individuals designated by the CDC to be higher risk: older adults, those with chronic conditions, those with immune disorders, pregnant women and others. 
Of course, not all university jobs can be completed remotely. It is important to note that even when classes are being delivered by alternative measures, the campus does not fully close. The residential and research aspects of our operations make a complete closing impossible. Our residence halls will remain open, as will many other essential facilities. And we will be doing everything we can to ensure employees who cannot work remotely are able to follow CDC guidelines, especially those regarding social distancing. Having a portion of our workforce remote allows those who need to be physically on campus to maintain greater social distancing.
We also are exploring ways to assist employees whose work can be conducted only in university facilities and who have compelling justification of the need for them to continue working. It is important that unit executives evaluate these requests carefully and balance the essential nature of this work with the safety of the individual. Again, in these instances, please remind employees to follow CDC guidelines, especially those regarding social distancing.
Finally, these temporary employment guidelines are intended to offer flexibility to units and employees with a goal of keeping our employees working. Units should consult with Illinois Human Resources to explore options for unique situations.
We know that these temporary employment guidelines will come with added complications in an already uncertain time. Thank you for your patience as we navigate this situation. Now, more than ever, it is important that our practices match our university values, and we are confident this is the right decision to protect the health and safety of our employees as we continue to fulfill our missions.

Today, Gov. J.B. Pritzker temporarily closed the state’s pre-kindergarten through 12th grade schools as part of ongoing efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 in Illinois.
As you know, the University of Illinois System also took a proactive approach by migrating courses to online or alternative delivery mechanisms and by reducing large gatherings to create the social distancing that our scientific experts say is key to slowing the outbreak.
Although primary and secondary schools will be closed, we want to remind you that our universities will remain open. Residence and dining halls will be open for students who chose to study from campus rather than home. In addition, many labs will be open for research, as will our hospital and clinics for patient care. 
Faculty and staff will continue their work at our universities. We know that child-care issues will arise with the closing of pre-K through 12th grade classrooms, and employees should work with their supervisors to identify alternative work arrangements where appropriate. You will hear more in the coming days from your university’s leadership with specific guidance on this matter. 
To date, we still have had no confirmed COVID-19 cases among our faculty, staff and students, and we will do everything in our power to limit the impact of the pandemic on our campuses going forward.
Thank you again for your understanding and flexibility. We recognize that this evolving situation is stressful and we encourage you all to take care of one another as we confront this public health crisis together.
Sincerely,
Tim

I write to follow up on Wednesday’s email from Chancellor Jones and Provost Cangellaris about the steps that campus is taking to slow the spread of COVID-19. These are challenging times, and I hope you all know by now that classes will be online after Spring Break, gatherings of over 50 people are suspended, and travel is restricted.
Beyond the very real human costs, there will be implications for the research enterprise. However, it is important to note that university research offices remain open and we have plans in place to minimize disruptions.
At the unit level, each research group or facility is best positioned to create a continuity plan that will meet their unique needs, and I urge you today to consider how you will manage disruptions, whether short or long term, to your research programs. The guidance below is provided to help you deliberately develop contingency plans with some immediate next steps. 
Within your research group and research service/support operations, please plan for:
Communication. Do you have an updated list of everyone’s cell phone numbers? Designate points of contact in your research, service or work group so that everyone receives timely information about your plans. These communication plans should include a contingency for those who will work remotely. 
Connectivity.Test your technology: be sure you can connect with others in your research group when meeting remotely. 
Decision-Making. Assess, consult and prioritize critical activities and identify back-ups for staff who are responsible for these tasks.
Assessment.
Identify any research experiments that can be ramped down, curtailed, or delayed, particularly as we head into this weekend.
Consider the impact of limited supplies and resources, particularly if they become unavailable.

Remote Work Plans. Develop remote work arrangements where appropriate, as an option for your research projects.
Travel. Travel is restricted. Talk to your Unit Executive Officer if you have essential business travel or research-related field work.
Thank you for your cooperation as this situation continues to rapidly evolve, particularly with changing information from our research sponsors. We understand that this uncertainty is not ideal. As information becomes available, we will provide additional, detailed guidance related to grants management and compliance in the research enterprise.  As always, please see the campus COVID 19 website for the most up-to-date information: https://covid19.illinois.edu/.
If you have questions about contingency planning, please direct an email to ovcr@illinois.edu.
Our best wishes for your safety and the safety of your research groups, colleagues, and families.

2020-03-13T10:24:00Z,2020-03-13,10:24,8503,Important information about transition to alternative...,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/8515307.html,"Dear Urbana faculty,
Wednesday night you received email from the Chancellor and me announcing that we will be suspending face-to-face instruction starting March 23. This message contains important details about this transition and available support resources.
LOGISTICAL DETAILS:
No face-to-face courses should be offered on or after March 23.
Faculty members are encouraged to transition to alternative delivery modes as soon as possible.
Faculty members should email students enrolled in their courses as soon as possible, but no later than the scheduled meeting time of your first class session after Spring Break, with plans for course continuation. If you do not have full plans ready at that time, your message should let students know when they can expect further details.
Students can choose whether they wish to come to campus after Spring Break. Students without reliable internet access at home are being encouraged to return to campus.
KEY GUIDELINES:
Faculty members are expected to make every effort to continue delivering their course(s). We recognize that some hands-on laboratory or performance courses might be difficult to continue. For those courses, we urge faculty to think creatively and consult colleagues to discuss ways to fulfill learning outcomes using alternative delivery methods.
Courses must comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Student information, including grades, may not be shared via email. It is recommended that students use their university credentials to access course materials and instruction on approved platforms. (Information on U.S. Department of Education student privacy protections can be found here. )
If you have students requiring disability accommodations, please work with DRES to ensure accessibility of your course.
Only university approved educational technologies should be utilized.
Students may NOT be asked to pay for additional fees related to course delivery. This includes proctoring service fees.
Any synchronous course sessions (such as Zoom, Skype for Business, Blackboard Collaborate) must be held during regularly scheduled class times.
Be mindful of how teaching assistants are utilized in the alternative delivery plan. Current guidelines and restrictions on TA time and workload should be maintained.
Please try to use the lowest bandwidth option that meets your instructional needs. Use Zoom only for interactive discussions. Do not use Zoom for classes of greater than 150 students. Use video, audio or text options for lecture delivery whenever possible.
If you use Zoom, be sure to login to https://illinois.zoom.usto generate your account. Free accounts made directly on the Zoom website may have restricted bandwidth and do not allow as many participants.
SUPPORT RESOURCES:
Walkthrough guides, training sessions and individual support for faculty on transitioning to alternatives modes of instructional delivery are available at illinois.edu/keepteaching. Use this portal to access CITL staff who are standing by and ready to help.
There is a checklist for faculty to help ensure you have completed all the steps necessary to transition your course to an alternative delivery mode HERE.
Some departments, schools and colleges have additional resources and support for their faculty. Please look for additional emails from your department, school or college.
All student technical support needs should be directed to consult@illinois.edu.
We appreciate your efforts to ensure instruction continues for our students. We also appreciate your flexibility and understanding with students who will be rapidly adapting to new instructional circumstances.
This is a singular time for our institution, and I thank each of you for your leadership, your creative approaches and your dedication to our students and our missions.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

For Faculty, Instructors and TAs: Details will follow in a separate communication about support resources to help with the transition to alternative online course delivery. Instructors should work with their unit and college leadership to ensure appropriate continuity for their courses.
For Undergraduate Students: If you are leaving campus for Spring Break, please make sure you have whatever computers and course materials you will need to continue with your courses remotely. You will be notified by your course instructors with instructions for how each course will be delivered. Please hold off on contacting faculty and advisors with questions until after you have received this information. Details about technical support for students will follow in separate communication.
For Graduate Students: We recognize that graduate education frequently involves research and educational experiences outside of traditional classroom settings. For this reason, advice pertaining to graduate students will be developed separately in consultation with their academic program and the Graduate College.
For more information, visit this FAQ.
Travel 
The university is prohibiting all international travel on university-sponsored business for faculty, staff and students from March 16 until further notice. Those who believe they have an essential business reason to travel by air can request a waiver through their unit leader (dean, vice provost, vice chancellor, etc.), but the expectation is that such waivers will be rare.
The university has cancelled all international Study Abroad for all students from March 14 to at least August 15. The university will offer assistance to address academic and financial issues and other challenges that might arise from this decision. Study abroad educational experiences are life-long and life-changing; however, our top priority at this time is to ensure our students’ personal health and safety while ensuring they can continue to make academic progress.
The university is limiting domestic travel for faculty, staff and students to pre-approved travel for essential university business. Those who believe they have an essential business reason to travel by air can request a waiver through their unit leader (dean, vice provost, vice chancellor, etc.), but the expectation is such waivers will be rare. 
The university is strongly advising against all international and domestic air travel on personal business for faculty, staff and students, especially those with underlying health conditions.
Anyone who travels to a CDC Level 2 or 3 region, whether for professional or personal reasons, will be required to self-quarantine off-campus for 14 days BEFORE returning to campus. More information about the Self-Quarantine Protocol can be found online.
For more information, visit this FAQ.
University-Sponsored Events and Meetings
The university is suspending all university-sponsored, in-person events and meetings in campus facilities, effective March 13. More specifically, gatherings of 50 or more attendees should be postponed or cancelled. Instead, if possible and as appropriate, organizers should explore alternative ways of conducting the event, e.g., livestreaming and conference calling. Technology Services is increasing its capacity to support the necessary digital platforms and additional internet traffic. Resources will be limited, so please be thoughtful when identifying alternative options if possible.
University-sponsored events include events such as: colloquia, seminars, workshops, town halls and registered student organization events.
Additionally, the university strongly recommends that individuals with underlying health conditions not attend any meetings or events on campus. Those who believe they have an essential business reason to hold an event can request a waiver through their unit leader (dean, vice provost, vice chancellor, etc.), but the expectation is such waivers will be rare. 
Beginning March 13, the university recommends that all in-person meetings be moved to an alternative solution unless meeting in-person is essential to do so. If so, please observe CDC guidelines on social distancing and other preventative measures.

2020-03-11T19:42:00Z,2020-03-11,19:42,76063,COVID-19 policies,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28768.html,"Dear faculty, staff and students:
We write today to share new policies for the University of Illinois System and its universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield, all designed to protect the health and welfare of our students, faculty and staff amid the global COVID-19 pandemic.
The proactive policies are focused squarely on doing our part to help curb the virus. Fortunately, there have been no confirmed cases among our faculty, staff and students. But such cases have been increasing in Illinois and our experts say early intervention is the best option to limit the spread.
Our policies will adopt best practices endorsed by state and national health officials by minimizing face-to-face exposure in classrooms and other types of large gatherings, and by limiting international and domestic travel. They were developed with guidance from the leading-edge healthcare experts across our universities, who have been consulting daily with a leadership team composed of the president, the chancellors and the provosts from all three universities. We will continue to monitor the outbreak and stay in constant contact with the Governor’s Office, the Illinois Department of Public Health, local health departments, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other universities around the state and the nation.
The new policies were carefully crafted to safeguard our students, faculty and staff without compromising the world-class education and the groundbreaking research discovery that are synonymous with the U of I System. They are:
Instruction
Courses at each of our three universities will immediately begin migrating to online or alternative delivery mechanisms to provide the social distancing that helps limit transmission of the virus, with a goal of completion by March 23. Classes will be held at their currently scheduled times.
Online and other alternative learning methods will continue until further notice, but our expectation is that it will be temporary and students will be updated regularly via email and updates on system and university websites.
Students have the option of studying remotely from home or from their campus residence after spring break.
Our campuses will remain open and ready to serve students, including residence and dining halls.
Each university will provide specific guidance for their students regarding both academic and housing arrangements.
Faculty and staff will continue their work on campus, including research, and human resources offices will provide guidance for work conditions that foster safety and for employees who suspect exposure or infection and must self-quarantine.
Events
Events with more than 50 attendees that are university-sponsored or hosted by registered student organizations will be suspended indefinitely, effective Friday, March 13.
Events may occur via livestream or other telecommunications, or be postponed to a future date.
Please check with each university for specific guidance.
Travel
All university-sponsored international travel is prohibited, along with non-essential domestic travel until further notice.
Personal international travel is strongly discouraged, and we urge caution and the exercise of good judgment for personal domestic travel.
Leaders of our three universities will share further information for how these policies will be implemented to address the specific educational and safety needs of their campus communities. UI Hospital and clinics will provide additional protocols to address the unique needs in providing care for their patients.
We recognize the many challenges this will create for our students, faculty and staff. We pledge to do everything in our power to support you during this temporary move to safeguard your health and the health of people in the communities we call home.
Our policies are rooted in our expert scientific knowledge base and exhibit an abundance of caution to take care of each other until the COVID-19 outbreak eases. We are all in this together, and appreciate your support and understanding.

2020-03-11T18:20:00Z,2020-03-11,18:20,76089,Community Safety Update,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/475383.html,"Dear campus community member:
We are writing to provide you with an update about the crime incidents we detailed in a Community Safety Notice last week.
As we noted, it was reported that two men had approached U. of I. students in off-campus locations and displayed what appeared to be handguns while demanding the students’ property. The Champaign Police Department on Friday arrested a juvenile who is one of the offenders involved in those incidents. During the arrest, police recovered a BB gun that is possibly one of the weapons used to intimidate the victims.
The Champaign Police Department is continuing to investigate, and we will provide additional updates when appropriate.
Anyone with information is encouraged to contact the Champaign Police Department at 217-351-4545. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android. All messages to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of identifying information and forwarded to police by an independent third party.
This is our community. Let's stay together.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks escort if you need one, or download the mobile app for iOS or Android.
Be alert. Maintaining awareness of your surroundings is critical, especially when traveling at night. Wearing headphones or looking at your phone diminishes your ability to respond to your surroundings. Walk with purpose, and stay attentive.
Trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.
If you choose to consume alcohol, please be responsible. Remember your ability to respond is diminished by overconsumption of alcohol.

In recent weeks, you have received various updates with information related to the widening COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak and the ways the situation may affect our campus and surrounding Champaign-Urbana community. As we approach our upcoming spring break on March 14-22, there are some health-related precautious I would like to share with you.
For those traveling domestically or abroad during spring break, I urge you to monitor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and State Department travel advisories for all destinations where you will be traveling. The safety level of any given destination could change before or during your trip, making it difficult to return to campus by the March 23 resumption of classes.
Our current policy is that any individual who travels to a CDC COVID-19 Level 2 or Level 3 country will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days before returning to campus. For more information, please see the university’s Self-Quarantine Policy.
Additionally, if you are a student and returning to the United States from a high-risk region:
You must complete the COVID-19 Travel Risk Screening Form (located under Forms), accessible through the MyMcKinley student portal, https://mymckinley.illinois.edu.
You may contact McKinley Health Center via email at studenthealthcenter@illinois.edu or phone at (217) 333-2700 for guidance.
As you know, other universities have announced alternatives to in-person classes for their students. We are continuing to look at a variety of options for delivering classroom instruction, in the event that face-to-face instruction needs to be suspended.
As a precaution, if you leave campus for Spring Break, we strongly advise that you take with you everything that you would need to continue your studies if the decision was made to suspend in-person classes. This could include books, computers, supplies, etc. Please also continue to check your email and the COVID-19 website for updates and more specific information on these decisions from the university and from your colleges and units.
If you have additional questions, I encourage you to reach out to the following resources:
Illinois Human Resources
International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS)
McKinley Health Center
Self-isolation and monitoring guidance

Student Assistance Center
Champaign-Urbana Public Health District
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Regardless of your destination, here are some spring break safety tips to follow:
Designate an emergency contact and leave itinerary, contact info, ID numbers, and credit/debit info with them.
Always be aware of your surroundings and how to get back to your hotel.
Only take what you absolutely need. Keep valuables, IDs, and money secured while away.
Know what VISA, ID, or passport is required to reach your destination.
Inform bank providers you will be traveling to avoid service disruption.
Together with my university colleagues, I will continue to carefully monitor developments that might affect the health and safety of our community. I will also continue to work closely with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District to take necessary precautions and will communicate critical updates to the campus community as new information becomes available.
Sincerely,Robert Parker, FACP, MBA, MDDirector, McKinley Health Center"
2020-03-05T15:20:00Z,2020-03-05,15:20,75959,An update on COVID-19,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28774.html,"Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
The worldwide COVID-19 outbreak continues to spread both this new disease, but also the uncertainty and apprehension that come with such rapidly changing circumstances and limited information. We also understand that these concerns extend to our entire community – from campus to Champaign, Urbana, Savoy and beyond.
We have established a new, central web resource, https://covid19.illinois.edu, as the starting point for information about the virus and university operations and plans. This site archives campus communications on the issue, provides some answers to the most frequent questions we’re hearing and links directly to the most current updates on COVID-19 impacts across our critical university operations – from health and safety to academics to human resources to student support. We have also set up an email address (covid-19@illinois.edu) for general questions. I encourage you to visit the site regularly and to share the address with anyone you know who might need this information. The site also links to the most current precautions advised by public health officials.
At this point, with no confirmed cases in our local area, most of our academic and business operations are continuing as usual. Classes continue to meet, and events continue to take place. And we all hope that circumstances do not require us to take any significant or disruptive new actions.
The Centers for Disease Control, state and local health officials are telling us to prepare for local cases. We are not currently aware of any confirmed cases in Urbana-Champaign. But as we have seen around the world and across the country, that can change very quickly. We have been using this time to develop response plans to ensure the safety and well-being of our students, faculty, staff and visitors, as well as the continued smooth operation of the university throughout the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak. I have outlined some of these steps in more detail at the end of this message.
But as important as plans and policies will be if the virus reaches anywhere in our local community, our success in keeping one another safe will be determined by our actions as human beings. We work and live closely together here and the results of our choices do not stop at the doors of our homes or offices.
This virus will impact all of us who live here in this area. If we are to confront a disease that will threaten our entire community, we must act together as a united community. We may not even know one another, but as this situation intensifies, I ask that we remember how much we all have in common.  
Students in our classes are worried about their well-being and thinking about their academic progress. Their parents and families – from all over the globe – want to know that their children will be safe. Staff and faculty members are thinking of their own families and friends. Members of the local community are dealing with these same uncertainties and challenges in their daily lives.
This is a community challenge. It is one that will truly require a community to navigate through it.
We will continue to update the COVID-19 website regularly, and we will communicate critical updates to all of our campus and community when we get new information.
Sincerely,
Robert J. Jones
March 5, 2020 Updates on Our Planning Efforts:
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has implemented a multi-faceted response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The university-community Infectious Disease Working Group (IDWG) has been meeting since the end of January, tracking the virus, developing plans for mitigation and response, and implementing those plans.
We established working groups in recent weeks, and those groups are identifying possible impacts of the outbreak on our campus community, as well as the triggering events that would initiate responses and the recommended responses. We are addressing the immediate impacts of the outbreak, but we also are planning for all possible longer-term impacts in the event the outbreak is not resolved quickly. The groups are addressing the following topics:
Academic continuity – this group is developing plans to ensure we can provide instruction to both our current and prospective students throughout this outbreak.
For Study Abroad students: We have implemented plans to allow any Study Abroad students to end their programs early and return home. Details about these plans can be found here.
Students, faculty or staff returning from CDC Level 2 or 3 countries will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days before they will be allowed on campus. The self-quarantine policy can be found here.
In light of continuing risks, we have cancelled all international spring break trips as well as any university-sponsored domestic student spring break programs that require air travel. More information about this can be found here.
For on-campus students: We are identifying ways to shift to online delivery of courses should the university be unable to continue providing in-person instruction.
For international students: We are developing options for new international students who might not be able to travel to campus this summer or fall to begin classes, and we are developing options for international students who are currently on campus and might not be able to return to their home country at the conclusion of the semester because of the outbreak. Information for international students can be found here.

Campus emergency response – this group is preparing for the possibility that one or more persons on our campus contract the virus.
Communications – this group is creating a communications plans and collateral materials that will ensure we are providing accurate, useful, actionable information to the various university stakeholders in a way that prevents unnecessary fear among our community members. A central campus web resource can be found here.
Community emergency response – this group includes university representatives, as well as leaders from area governments, healthcare organizations, schools and other relevant agencies, and members are coordinating efforts to prepare for the possibility that one or more persons in the local community could contract the virus.
Disability issues – this group is considering special concerns related to people with disabilities in the event the outbreak interrupts normal campus operations that are vital to these members of our campus community.
Events – this group is considering the possible need to postpone or cancel events that involve large gatherings (e.g., athletic events, Engineering Open House, Commencement), as well as how to mitigate the negative impact of any such cancellations.
Financial issues – this group is determining how to mitigate the financial implications for students whose studies are interrupted by the outbreak, and it is estimating the possible financial costs to the university.
Housing – this group is working to identify housing options that could accommodate all students currently studying abroad in the event they all choose to return to campus because of the outbreak, and it is identifying housing options that could accommodate the international students who are currently on campus but might not be able to return to their home country at the conclusion of the semester. More information about this can be found here.

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in an off-campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, you can view the daily crime log.
The Champaign Police Department has informed University of Illinois Police of two incidents that occurred within a block and within a few minutes of each other. At 10:44 p.m. Sunday, in the 400 block of South Fifth Street, Champaign, it was reported that a U. of I. student was approached by two men, both of whom displayed handguns and demanded the student’s belongings. The student gave one of the men his property, and the two offenders fled. Several minutes later, in the 300 block of South Fifth Street, Champaign, a second U. of I. student was approached by a man who displayed a handgun, but the offender fled immediately. Both students were approached as they entered private apartment complexes. Neither student was physically injured. The Champaign Police Department is investigating.
The University of Illinois Police Department, in cooperation with the Champaign Police Department and the Urbana Police Department, has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area. Between these agencies, our campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 1,900 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information is encouraged to contact the Champaign Police Department at 217-351-4545. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android. All messages to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of identifying information and forwarded to police by an independent third party.
This is our community. Let's stay together.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks escort if you need one.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 9-1-1 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.
If you choose to consume alcohol, please be responsible. Remember your ability to respond is diminished by overconsumption of alcohol.

With the continued uncertainty caused by the rapidly changing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) situation globally and nationally, below are several important updates that affect our university community.
We want to share four recent developments, as well as additional information about precautions we are taking to ensure the health and safety of our campus community:
All students, faculty members and staff are required to leave Italy. New escalations of U.S. Department of State travel advisory to “Level 4, Avoid Travel” for regions of Italy have led us to suspend all academic programs in that country. In accordance with this decision and the federal direction, all students, and faculty members and staff on university business are required to depart Italy as soon as possible. This decision will impact 137 study abroad students in Italy. The full communication about this action can be found here.
All students, faculty members and staff are required to leave the Daegu region of South Korea, and encouraged to leave all sites in South Korea.New escalations of U.S. Department of State travel advisory to “Level 4, Avoid Travel” for the Daegu region of South Korea have led us to suspend academic programs in that area. We are requiring all students, and faculty members and staff on university business in the Daegu region to leave the country as soon as possible. Additionally, we are also strongly encouraging students, faculty members and staff in any part of South Korea to depart voluntarily. These decisions will impact 15 study abroad students in South Korea. The full communication about this action can be found here.
In accordance with existing and escalating travel alerts, travel to China, Iran, Italy, and the Daegu region of South Korea on university business is being restricted.All students, faculty members and staff are prohibited from traveling to China, Iran, Italy and the Daegu region of South Korea on university business or using university resources. This is an evolving situation; the list of countries may change rapidly.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has instructed universities to consider postponing or canceling student foreign exchange programs, and we are offering all study abroad students the opportunity to end their program early.In response to a growing number of questions and concerns expressed by students and their families, we are offering all 852 of our study abroad participants in any location the opportunity to voluntarily end their program immediately and return to their permanent home. We are working diligently to arrange alternative methods to deliver instruction to any students who want to continue making academic progress this semester. We recognize that there can be financial and academic implications for students, and we are committed to working with them to the best of our ability to mitigate any negative impacts.
We are also taking several precautionary measures to ensure those returning to our campus from areas with COVID-19 exposure do not present any safety or health concerns for our community.
Students, faculty members and staff who are coming from countries under CDC travel advisories of Level 2 or 3 who choose to return to the campus to resume activities will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days. Illinois Human Resources and McKinley Health Center will be working with returning travelers to ensure compliance with the 14-day self-quarantine protocol. A full list of CDC travel advisories can be found here.
It is also important to note that any individuals traveling to nations that are under CDC Levels 2 or 3 travel advisories during spring break also will be required to observe and prove this 14-day self-quarantine before being allowed to resume normal campus activities. For those traveling abroad during spring break, we urge you to monitor the CDC and State Department travel advisories, as the safety level of any given destination could change before or during your trip, making it difficult to return to campus by the March 23 resumption of classes. Please watch in the coming days and weeks for additional information on issues such as summer Study Abroad and other potential longer-term impacts of COVID-19.
We understand that the continued spread of the virus is generating concern and uncertainty for many. At this time, there are still no cases of COVID-19 in the Champaign-Urbana community. And we are continuing to work closely with state and local health officials on all medical issues and to implement precautions to help ensure the safety of all who live here.
Thank you all for your patience and understanding as we continue to make decisions and develop plans to protect our faculty members, staff and students on a constantly evolving issue.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellorAndreas C. CangellarisProvost"

On Friday, March 6, 2020, many students and visitors will participate in an event known as Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. The university does not support or condone this event.
The Champaign, Urbana, and University of Illinois police departments, assisted by other local and state agencies, will patrol the campus district on March 6. They will enforce all applicable ordinances in commercial and residential areas and have authority to intervene if private parties threaten to disturb the peace. In addition, Champaign and Urbana officials will enact restrictions on liquor sales intended to curb overconsumption. Emergency medical personnel will be available to provide care.
University police will continue to focus on protecting students, staff, faculty, and university property. If asking a disruptive student to leave class could escalate into a confrontation, you may seek assistance from these officers. Should you need to report an incident, call METCAD at 911 for emergencies, 333-8911 for non-emergencies.
As in years past, we have made it clear to students that academic business will continue as usual on Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. Instructors are encouraged not to cancel classes.
The Student Code https://studentcode.illinois.edu/ addresses student responsibilities on campus. Sections 1-102(d) concerns classroom conduct expectations, section 1-305 is the policy on drugs, and section 1-307 focuses on alcohol. The Code empowers instructors to ask disruptive students to leave class. Names of disruptive students should be reported to the Office of Student Conflict Resolution at 217-333-3680.
Students are not to bring any liquids into Foellinger Auditorium and Lincoln Hall Theatre. Longstanding policy prohibits liquids and food in these spaces.
Interference with the academic mission of the university will result in students facing serious consequences. Thank you for reinforcing this message before and on March 6.

2020-02-18T15:38:00Z,2020-02-18,15:38,75935,Illinois Alcohol and Other Drugs (AOD) Prevention Program,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28752.html,"Dear Students and Employees,
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act requires the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:
http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/
The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.
Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to marijuana in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s marijuana prohibition.
The university’s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.
The university’s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.
Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. University employees should contact Illinois Human Resources at (217) 333-2137.
Sincerely,
Dr. Danita M. B. YoungVice Chancellor for Student Affairs"
2020-02-14T17:56:00Z,2020-02-14,17:56,75878,Information about a case of bacterial meningitis on campus,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28766.html,"Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
I write to let you know that a student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has been diagnosed with a case of bacterial meningitis, as confirmed by the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. The student, a resident of off-campus housing, has been isolated at an area hospital for treatment, and authorities have identified, contacted and treated anyone who may have had close contact with the student – including hospital staff.
As a result of those efforts, we do not believe there is a risk of the illness spreading.
Bacterial meningitis is a serious illness that spreads to other people through sharing personal items, kissing or prolonged close exposure such as residing in the same household. There is low risk to other people in the general community.
When we learn of incidents like this, we act as quickly and carefully as possible to limit the potential spread within campus and into the broader community. The university works with state and local health officials and the McKinley Health Center to contact the students, staff, faculty members or others in the community who may have been exposed during that period.
We will keep you informed if there are any new developments that would impact the health and safety of our campus.
Sincerely,
Dr. Danita M. B. YoungVice Chancellor for Student Affairs"

By now, I hope you have all read President Killeen’s message sharing the Governor’s announcement to release $500 million in state funding for the Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) and the Illinois Innovation Network (IIN). This is exciting news for the future economic prosperity for our state, and it is also a cause for celebration for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and our entire community.
The DPI and IIN partnerships and initiatives that our faculty and staff are building will have an enormous impact here. From building our data sciences infrastructure to renovating Altgeld Hall to expanding NCSA in support of cutting-edge computing as well as investments that position our leadership in quantum to expanding our capacity to lead in quantum science to growing opportunities for our entrepreneurial faculty and students to bringing new businesses to our Research Park to bolstering our public engagement programs, this announcement today in Chicago will directly result in new jobs, new educational opportunities and new economic development right here at home.
Today’s announcement marks a major step forward in bringing public and private partners together to invest in the future of our state in ways that will drive a global economy. And as President Killeen also noted, one exciting new private investment was announced today in the form of a $10 million gift from our Board of Trustees Chair Don Edwards and his wife, Anne. Both are Gies College of Business graduates and their gift will support scholarship initiatives in that college as well as support for athletics and new investments in DPI and IIN. We are grateful to Don and Anne for their generous gift, which exemplifies the support expressed by our alumni and friends for these new endeavors.
This is an exciting day for all of us here at Illinois.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

I am delighted to share the news that Governor J.B. Pritzker announced today he is releasing $500 million in state funding set aside for development of our Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) and Illinois Innovation Network (IIN).
The significant state appropriation will support planning and construction of DPI’s permanent facility in downtown Chicago and IIN hubs at each of our three universities, on our satellite campuses in Peoria and Rockford, and at every public university across the state. We are working to break ground for DPI within 2020 and to begin construction on some IIN hubs soon.
Governor Pritzker anticipates that his release of funding will also accelerate private fundraising for DPI and IIN, which have gained momentum since the governor took office 13 months ago and became a champion for the pioneering initiatives. The U of I System has pledged to match state funding and has already raised $230 million in personal and corporate donations, along with another $224 million in non-state funding.
That sum grew today with the announcement of an historically generous gift from U of I Board of Trustees Chairman Don Edwards and his wife, Anne. The $10 million gift is the largest ever by a U of I trustee, and will be divided between DPI/IIN and programs at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where both Don and Anne earned their degrees.
News releases sent to media today provide more detail on the governor’s release of funding and the Edwards' gift.
I am deeply grateful to everyone across our University System who has a hand in making DPI and IIN a reality – from system and university leadership to our growing DPI and IIN teams to the nearly 1,000 faculty who signed on to help guide programming. Your work will write the next chapters in our long legacy of excellence, and fuel a new era of progress and prosperity for our state and nation.
Sincerely,
Tim"

Here is a link to a Climate Survey on Sexual Misconduct email that was sent to all Illinois students at 8 a.m. this morning.
You can read the massmail here.
The message provides a summary of the results for a sexual misconduct survey we conducted in the spring of 2019, as well as a link to view the full report on the We Care website.
In the email, I share with students my commitment to work together as a community to eliminate the problem of sexual misconduct on campus. Together we can make our campus a safe and welcoming place for everyone.
Please review the detailed report so you are aware of the findings and prepared to direct students to resources of support should they request them.
Questions regarding this report should be directed to Chantelle Thompson, Director of Marketing and Communications for Student Affairs (cthomps@illinois.edu | (217) 300-4221).

Sexual misconduct is prevalent in our society and the University of Illinois is not immune. We are working to improve the campus climate, so we asked you to tell us about your experiences in classrooms, residence halls, apartments, the library, bars, restaurants, and everywhere in the community.
By understanding what is happening and what you think about how the University will respond, we can better address this critical issue and ensure that you have the best experience possible as an Illinois student.
Here is what you told us:
You tell your friends or family, not necessarily University authorities, of sexual misconduct, so we need to increase efforts to help you, your teachers, all our employees and your parents learn about the resources available to help, and we need to make sure you know that we are committed to supporting you.
You understand that we will respect your privacy and keep reports of sexual misconduct confidential.
You are fairly confident that the University will handle incidents appropriately. Programs such as First Year Campus Acquaintance Rape Education (FYCARE), ICARE Bystander Intervention, the We Care website and other promotional materials must be continued and enhanced.
Although being under the influence of alcohol is not an excuse or reason for sexual misconduct, there is a relationship between the misuse of alcohol and sexual misconduct. We will use this information to help you better understand this relationship and the dangers of being under the influence of alcohol in certain settings.
We greatly appreciate the time many of you took to share your experiences. During the 2019 spring semester, 12,500 graduate and undergraduate students were invited to take part in a survey. Of those invited, 2,076 completed at least a portion of the survey and the respondents reflect current student demographics. I am committed to continuing this effort to understand the student experience around sexual misconduct and doing whatever I can to improve the climate on campus. We will hold focus groups to explore more ways to improve our response to survivors.
As the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, I am committed to garnering the resources of all departments to eliminate the problem of sexual misconduct on campus. The Chancellor, Provost, and all executives of the University share my dedication to this important mission. We need you to help us by looking out for each other, intervening when you see a potential problem and helping your friends and family find resources when they feel they have been the victim of sexual misconduct.
Detailed findings from the sexual misconduct survey are available at wecare.illinois.edu/reports.

I write to share the bittersweet news that Susan Koch will retire June 30 after nearly a decade as chancellor of the University of Illinois at Springfield and vice president of the U of I System.
Our longest-serving current chancellor, Susan will leave a legacy of excellence that will be felt for generations. Since taking office in 2011, her leadership has brought new academic programs, new opportunities for students and a new, award-winning Student Union that has given the growing campus a lasting new hub of student activity.
On behalf of the entire U of I family, I am deeply grateful for her passion, her vision, her commitment and her persistence to ensure teaching and scholarship at UIS that transforms the lives of students and serves the needs of our state and nation.
I equally value Susan’s friendship and counsel, and wish her and her husband Dennis a retirement filled with family, friends and joy.
The news release below will be sent to media this morning announcing Susan’s much-deserved retirement.
Sincerely,
Tim
UIS Chancellor Koch announces retirementLed academic and physical transformation of university since 2011
SPRINGFIELD –Susan J. Koch, chancellor of the University of Illinois Springfield (UIS) since 2011, announced Friday she will retire as chancellor of UIS and vice president of the University of Illinois System effective June 30. She is currently the longest-serving chancellor of the U of I System.
During her tenure, Koch has provided leadership and vision for UIS, which is ranked the top regional public university in Illinois by U.S. News & World Report.
“The past nine years have been among the most fulfilling of my career, and it has been a privilege to work with so many outstanding faculty, staff and students,” Koch said. “I love the university and the community my husband Dennis and I have called home for nearly a decade, and I am so proud of everything this young university has achieved.”
U of I System President Tim Killeen said Koch will leave a legacy that will be felt by students for generations.
“Susan’s leadership and persistence have enriched UIS’s academic excellence, provided new opportunities for students, expanded and beautified the campus and laid the groundwork to do even more,” Killeen said. “I am grateful for her commitment, her friendship and I wish her and Dennis nothing but happiness in their much-deserved retirement.”
Since her appointment in July 2011, UIS has added numerous academic programs to meet the interests of students as well as the needs of local and regional employers. They include programs in information systems security, data analytics, theater, exercise science, and a new bachelor of science in nursing through a partnership with University of Illinois at Chicago and Memorial Health System. With Koch at the helm, UIS also has successfully recruited two University of Illinois Distinguished Scholars – Ken Kriz in public administration and Graham Peck in Lincoln studies. The additions are part of an initiative to attract senior star faculty who can help transform the system’s three universities through their exceptional teaching and scholarship.
Record fundraising under Koch’s leadership has resulted in construction of a new, award-winning $21.7 million Student Union, the first on the UIS campus, and an increase in scholarship support to improve students’ access to a UIS education.
Koch has led many successful fundraising endeavors for UIS. The Brilliant Futures Campaign, completed in 2012, surpassed its $28 million goal. The current Reaching Stellar Campaign, set to conclude in 2022, has raised more than $33 million of its $40 million goal to date.
Private giving has also led to the creation of “The Sangamon Experience,” a unique exhibition space and research initiative opened Jan. 30 that will support faculty and students and spur new research, teaching and community engagement about the Sangamon region of Illinois. A new Center for Lincoln Studies, also supported by private gifts, will open later this spring.
Koch was instrumental in the university’s August 2018 acquisition of Innovate Springfield. In joining UIS, the downtown innovation and business center became the first hub of the Illinois Innovation Network, a network of research and education centers across the state led by the U of I System. They will partner with the system’s Discovery Partners Institute in Chicago to foster the innovation and talent that drives progress and economic growth.
Her leadership has also led to expansion of the university’s young Division II athletics program, whose teams have won individual and conference championships. At the same time, Prairie Stars student-athletes this past fall earned the highest collective grade-point average (3.38) in university history.
Koch has secured several awards from the U of I System’s Chester Fund, a privately funded endowment to support the acquisition of significant artwork for campus beautification. Acquisitions include “The Young Lawyer,” a Lincoln sculpture by George Lundeen; a Shakespeare Garden featuring “Shakespeare,” a sculpture by James Price; and works by Sanford Biggers and Lisa Williamson for the Student Union.
“While I am looking forward to having time that my husband and I can devote to enjoying our family and to unlocking new possibilities to grow and contribute, this was a bittersweet decision,” Koch said. “What makes it easier is my confidence that UIS will continue to be an asset for our community and our state thanks to dedicated colleagues, alumni and donors who believe in our vision to be a pathway of opportunity for the thousands of students we educate each year.”
“To have played a small part in the success of our university is a gift I will always treasure,”  Koch added.
Killeen said there will be a timely and transparent leadership transition process.
Koch is the sixth chief executive in the nearly 50-year history of the university. It was known as Sangamon State University for 25 years and has been part of the U of I System since 1995.
Koch’s career encompasses more than four decades in education, with the last 35 years in higher education. Before her appointment as UIS chancellor, Koch served as provost and vice president for academic affairs at Northern Michigan University. She also served as associate provost and graduate dean at the University of Northern Iowa, where she began her career in higher education as a professor of community and public health.
Koch earned a bachelor’s degree with honors from Dakota State University in South Dakota and master’s and doctoral degrees from the University of Northern Iowa. In 2016, she was awarded an honorary doctorate in public service from Dakota State University. Koch is also the author of a widely read monthly column, “UIS Perspectives,” for Springfield’s State Journal-Register and has been active with several community organizations along with serving on many boards in central Illinois.

We continue to monitor the coronavirus and to take any new actions that are warranted as new information emerges in this rapidly changing situation. Last week’s messages from Provost Cangellaris and from Dr. Parker can be found here if you missed those updates.
As I write today, there are no confirmed cases of the virus in Urbana-Champaign and no individuals who are suspected of being infected. There have been two confirmed cases in the Chicago area in the same family. The McKinley Health Center is regularly updating their website with the latest information on the disease and steps you can take to protect yourself.
But while the virus may not have a physical presence here, we know the situation in China at the moment is very serious and has been the basis for a Level 4 U.S. travel advisory. To those in our community with family and friends navigating this difficult time there, the thoughts of all of us at Illinois are with you. And I would remind all of our students, staff and faculty that we have a number of resources for support and assistance if you are ever in need of them. Students can contact the Student Assistance Center or the Emergency Dean (217-333-0050) or find other resources at odos.illinois.edu/community-of-care. Faculty/Staff Assistance Services (217-244-5312) is the place to start for staff and faculty members.
For other questions and concerns, here are some suggested resources.  
Students with questions or concerns about their health or believe they might be experiencing symptoms related to coronavirus infection should contact the McKinley Health Center at 217-333-2700.
Faculty or staff who are concerned about their health or believe they might be experiencing symptoms should call their regular health care provider for guidance.
Faculty, students and staff with questions or concerns about travel plans or the suspension of academic programs in China should contact International Safety and Security at safetyabroad@illinois.edu or call 217-333-6104.
Human Resources staff members in colleges, departments and units who are receiving questions related to employment policies and practices should contact Illinois Human Resources for guidance.
I want to thank everyone in our community for taking steps to protect yourselves and one another. Whether it is wearing a mask because you are concerned about getting or spreading any infection, staying home from work or class when you are sick or getting your annual flu shot, we are all healthier and safer.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"
2020-01-29T09:08:00Z,2020-01-29,9:8,75756,Update on coronavirus for the campus community,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28749.html,"Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
As you all know, the rapid emergence of the coronavirus in the past weeks is generating a great deal of public information and also many questions about our campus and community actions. Monday’s massmail from Dr. Robert Parker, director of McKinley Health Center, provides some important background, and I encourage you to read it if you have not already done so.
I want to share a central update here on precautions, plans and decisions based on what we know of the situation today.
What is the status of the coronavirus in our community and what precautions are in place here? 
There has been one confirmed case in the State of Illinois.
The Champaign-Urbana community has no confirmed cases nor are there any individuals in our community under investigation for possible infections.
When the virus was linked to Wuhan, China, the university identified approximately 150 students from that area.
McKinley Health Center Director Dr. Bob Parker contacted each of the students informing them of safety precautions and urging them to be seen at McKinley if they believed they had any symptoms of the illness.
Many of them had not traveled home over winter break.
Of those who did travel to Wuhan, some have elected to self-quarantine, monitor themselves, and/or wear a surgical mask when going to class and attending other activities.
No one with a link to Wuhan has exhibited any symptoms of the illness.
On January 22, the first day of classes for the spring semester, McKinley Health Center also began screening all students who came to the Center with symptoms.
Does the continuing emergency of the coronavirus in China impact students, staff or faculty traveling from the United States?
Based on newly issued federal advisories, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is suspending academic programs in China for the 2020 spring semester. Students will not be allowed to travel to China for university-related matters while the advisories are in effect.
While the university draws on a variety of sources for information, we use U.S. government sources as the benchmark for our decisions. On Monday (Jan. 27), The Department of State elevated its travel advisory for China to Level 3, Reconsider Travel. (More information on the advisory levels is here.) Also on Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Warning Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel for China.
This decision will affect only a very small number of students studying with partner universities in China. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is in contact with those students and will work with them to adjust their academic plans for the semester.
Does this suspension of student academic programs also apply to faculty and staff? 
We encourage faculty and staff planning to travel to China to review the federal advisories and make an informed decision regarding travel. The concern is the spread of the coronavirus, as well as logistic difficulties experienced as China implements containment measures.
Travelers should also be aware of the demographics shared by CDC for being most at risk, which includes older adults and people with underlying health conditions. If faculty and staff travel, we encourage enrollment in the university’s international insurance and the Department of State Smart Traveler Enrollment Program.
Faculty or staff who are currently involved in academic programs in China should contact their department, unit or college executive officer for guidance on operations for the rest of the semester.
Where can I get more information?
Students with questions or concerns about their health or believe they might be experiencing symptoms related to coronavirus infection should contact the McKinley Health Center at 217-333-2700.
Faculty or staff who are concerned about their health or believe they might be experiencing symptoms should call their regular healthcare provider for guidance.
Faculty, students and staff with questions or concerns about travel plans or the suspension of academic programs in China should contact International Safety and Security at safetyabroad@illinois.edu or call 217-333-6104.
Human resources staff members in colleges, departments and units who are receiving questions related to employment policies and practices will receive more guidance directly from Illinois Human Resources.
Department heads and directors of graduate studies will receive information from the Graduate College on implications for applications to graduate programs for prospective students from countries affected by the coronavirus.
This is clearly a rapidly changing situation, and we will continue to carefully monitor developments that might impact the health and safety of any members of our community. We will work closely with our medical staff and with the CUPHD to take necessary precautions and to share critical and accurate new information as we learn of it.
Thank you for your careful attention and for your efforts in protecting your own health and that of your colleagues, friends and our entire community.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

The university continues to work closely with our local, state, and national public health agencies to address the threat presented by the Novel Coronavirus 2019-CoV. We also follow regular updates from the World Health Organization (WHO) at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/ and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html.
The United States has been successful in containing the spread of the virus. As of the morning of Sunday, January 26, there are five confirmed cases of the coronavirus in four states within the U.S. With an incubation period of 14 days, it is possible to see more cases announced over the next week or so, linked to Wuhan City, China.
The university began planning and implementing a response as soon as we learned of the national threat. On Friday, January 24, McKinley Health Center contacted students who have a known connection to Wuhan City. Students who did not travel home to Wuhan City over winter break are not at increased risk. Of those who did travel, some have elected to self-quarantine, monitor themselves, and/or wear a surgical mask when going to class and attending other activities.
All students who come to McKinley Health Center with respiratory symptoms are being masked at the entrance and educated regarding ways to keep themselves and others healthy. Students who identify themselves as at risk for a respiratory illness, via phone call prior to visiting the health center or upon entry to the health center, will be masked and receive special handling.
Coronaviruses are generally spread by droplet contact. This commonly means that you must be within 6 feet of an infected person who is coughing and sneezing, or via close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands or touching an object or surface with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes before washing your hands. Epidemiologists are implementing these intensive “airborne” precautions because the Novel Coronavirus 2019-CoV is not well studied at this point, and they cannot fully exclude the possibility that it could spread through the air. 
Most of our students have been back on campus for at least seven days. In that time, we have had one person with possible symptoms, but it was determined the person did not have the illness. We are very hopeful and taking great strides to keep our campus safe.
As the Director of McKinley Health Center, I want to express my deep gratitude to our international students who have been wonderful to work with during this global situation.

You probably have heard news reports about the coronavirus, which was first diagnosed in China and has since spread to the United States. Please know that the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is taking safety precautions to detect and treat any potential case of the virus, following the latest guidelines from Public Health.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest the following ways to protect yourself:
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick (i.e. within 6 feet).
If you are a student, and you experience symptoms such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath, or if you feel you may be at risk for coronavirus, please call McKinley Health Center immediately at (217) 333-2700. Others should contact their health care provider directly.

I am writing to inform you of a transition in the leadership of the University of Illinois Police Department (UIPD).
Executive Director of Public Safety and Chief of Police Craig Stone announced this morning that he is leaving UIPD to become the Deputy Director of the Department of Public Safety for the City of Columbus. He will conclude his appointment here on Jan. 15.
I have asked Deputy UI Police Chief Matt Myrick to serve as interim executive director of public safety and chief of police as we conduct a national search for a candidate to fill those roles on a permanent basis. This appointment will begin on Jan. 16.
Chief Stone has made major strides in building strong processes and approaches for UIPD, and he made clear to me that he had not been actively looking at other positions. But leaders in Columbus recruited him, and the pull of family and home was great.
I am grateful for the many things Chief Stone has accomplished in his relatively short time here.
We will begin a national search for Chief Stone’s replacement as quickly as possible, and I thank Interim Chief Myrick for his dedication and his willingness to step up to ensure we have steady and dependable leadership during this time of transition.

NAGPRA is a federal law that requires institutions like ours to transfer culturally affiliated human remains and associated funerary objects, culturally unaffiliated human remains and associated funerary objects, unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony to the Native American tribes and lineal descendants.
In keeping with the requirements of NAGPRA, best practices among our peers, and the ethics of our institution, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is fully committed to the repatriation of our Native American, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian collections that fall under NAGPRA. In this process, it is our priority to engage in consultation with tribal communities and lineal descendants. This is an integral part of our ongoing commitment to creating strong and meaningful relationships with Native Nations and to ensure that Native American scholars and students feel welcome and respected at Illinois.
NAGPRA Staff and Advisory CommitteeOur NAGPRA efforts are currently led by the Chancellor’s Fellow of Indigenous Research and Ethics (Dr. Jenny Davis, Assistant Professor, Department of Anthropology), and a search for a NAGPRA Program Officer is underway. Their activities will be informed by a NAGPRA Policies & Procedures Committee. Initially, committee members will develop policies and procedures for campus-wide NAGPRA compliance. Longer term, they will serve as an advisory board to campus NAGPRA compliance efforts and the NAGPRA Program Officer.
Training and Additional InformationWe will begin hosting in-person training starting in Spring 2020. In the meantime, consider reviewing these online resources. 
National NAGPRA office training videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/NationalNAGPRA
UCLA's Carrying Our Ancestors Home project: http://www.coah-repat.com/
Coordinating efforts through one existing central campus office will facilitate fulfillment of our NAGPRA legal obligations in a timely manner and actively affirms the university’s commitment to respect the sovereignty of Native Nations in our research, teaching, and museum practices.
In addition to the OVCRI, the implementation of NAGPRA represents work by several units and departments on campus, including the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, the Office of the Chancellor, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the Department of Anthropology, the Prairie Research Institute, the Illinois State Archaeological Survey, the Spurlock Museum, American Indian Studies, and the Krannert Art Museum. I am particularly grateful to Dr. Davis, Dr. Sean C. Garrick, Dr. Gioconda Guerra Pérez, staff in the OVCRI, and the many other departments, faculty members and staff who have been leading this effort.

Unfortunately, this past semester has seen hate spread on this campus unlike what has been previously seen. Racism, antisemitism, homophobia, Islamophobia, and cultural ignorance have plagued this campus and our community. Reported incidents of hate crimes have increased from the previous year and abhorrent symbols of hate have been found everywhere from University bathrooms to campus bars. The presence of these is meant to divide us and as students, we must refuse to let that happen. As a collective institution of over 51,000 students, those who seek to oppress others and divide must not bring us down.
Our values are being tested, and we will respond by reaffirming our commitment to inclusion and care for each other, regardless of background.
The epidemic of antisemitism on this campus is horrific. The idea that any individual feels threatened for their expression of personal religious or ethnic identity is unacceptable. Symbols filled with hatred and violence such as swastikas have consistently appeared on this campus and that hate will not be tolerated here. I stand in support with all students affected by these incidents and urge all to not ignore these symbols, but immediately report them so the perpetrators can be brought to justice. You can report acts of intolerance and bias here and hate crimes should be immediately reported to the police.
Due to recent events on campus, it is worth distinguishing that criticism of Israel, similar to criticism of any other country is not antisemitic and should not be labeled as such. The Illinois Student Government recently passed a resolution, ISG.03.29, Condemning Ignorance of Racism and Equating Anti-Zionism with Antisemitism. This resolution highlighted that those on this campus whose beliefs may align with Anti-Zionism at its root, are not being antisemitic in their criticism of Israel. There is however, a line that all must be aware of. There have been multiple times antisemitism and Anti-Zionism have been conflated on this campus and this resolution passed to protect our Pro-Palestinian students from being mislabeled and harassed as antisemitic due to their beliefs.
This University promises an experience that prepares students to live, work, and lead in a multicultural, diverse, and international society. The University needs to live up to their obligations and faculty, staff, administrators, and students must protect all students regardless of status, race, ethnicity, class, gender, and sexual orientation. We stand with our Jewish students, our Palestinian students, and all students, so that they do not fear for their safety and their beliefs be protected as our United States Constitution provides for.
The work of creating an inclusive environment is everyone’s responsibility. We are committed to continuing our work with faculty, students, and staff to create a positive climate on this campus that is inclusive of all students.
Have a great Winter Break,
Connor JosellisStudent Body President"

You can consent to access your W-2/1042-S/1095-C by clicking on the Pay tab on the System HR Website at www.hr.uillinois.edu. You can retrieve the forms anywhere you can access the internet. Online forms will be available to you sooner, and cannot get lost in the mail or sent to an old address. 
Provide Consent by January 15 for Electronic AccessIf you wish to have early access to your Form W-2, Form 1042-S, and/or Form 1095-C, then you have until 10:59 p.m. CST on Jan. 15, 2020, to complete the consent process and receive your Form W-2, Form 1042-S, and/or Form 1095-C electronically. If you are receiving a Form W-2, Form 1042-S, and/or Form 1095-C and previously consented to receive all three forms electronically, you will NOT need to consent again in order to access your Form(s) W-2, 1042-S and/or 1095-C online. However, if you are receiving Form(s) W-2, 1042-S, and/or 1095-C and did not individually consent to receive each form electronically, you will need to consent again for the individual form that does not display a consent status in order to access all of your forms online. You will receive a separate notice from University Payroll & Benefits with instructions on how to retrieve your form(s) electronically. Once you consent to have electronic access, you will not have to consent again each year.
What if I Do Not Consent to Retrieve Forms Electronically?If you do not provide consent by 10:59 p.m. CST on Jan. 15, 2020, you will receive a printed W-2 and/or 1042-S to be mailed no later than Jan. 31, 2020. If you will also be receiving a 1095-C and you do not consent by 10:59 p.m. CST on Jan. 15, 2020, you will receive a printed 1095-C to be mailed no later than March 2, 2020. Printed forms will be mailed to the mailing address on file. If you do not receive your printed W-2 and/or 1042-S by Feb. 7, 2020, or your printed 1095-C by March 9, 2020, and have not consented to receive an electronic form, you should contact University Payroll & Benefits Customer Service by calling 217-265-6363 (UIUC), 312-996-7200 (UIC), or 217-206-7144 (UIS), or emailing payinq@uillinois.edu to request a duplicate. You may also access the System HR Website (Pay tab) at www.hr.uillinois.edu to print a duplicate Form W-2 and/or 1042-S after Feb. 7, 2020, and a duplicate Form 1095-C after March 9, 2020.
If you will be receiving your Form(s) W-2, 1095-C, and/or 1042-S by mail, because you do not wish to receive these forms electronically, then your form(s) will be mailed to the mailing address listed on your My Profile in the System HR website as of Dec. 31, 2019. If you did not have an active mailing address at that time, the form will be sent to your listed home/permanent address.

2019-12-09T17:10:00Z,2019-12-09,17:10,73559,Campus Safety Notice,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28722.html,"Dear campus community member:
We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes on or immediately adjacent to campus property.
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes.
The University of Illinois Police Department has received a report that a student was sexually assaulted after 2 a.m. on Sunday, Dec. 8, at a university residence hall on College Court in Urbana. There was no information available on the identity of the offender.
In instances of sexual offenses, we generally do not include specific details about exact locations or times to avoid releasing information that could lead to the identification of a survivor, unless that information is of vital importance to the safety of the campus community. We do this to reduce the possibility that a survivor becomes the target of retaliation, harassment or further psychological harm.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to assist those involved in this incident and will continue to take actions to maintain the safety and security of the campus community.
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.
If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another person, intervene if it’s safe to do so or call for assistance.
While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. The university, community organizations and local law enforcement offer a number of reporting options.
Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.
It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.

We would like to provide you with an update to an incident that prompted a Campus Safety Notice earlier today. Two individuals were arrested Wednesday afternoon for their involvement in that incident, which occurred at 11:56 p.m. Tuesday. You can find more information about those arrests on the University of Illinois Police Department website: https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/6221/804815 
We thank all of our community members who reviewed the information we distributed earlier and reached out to offer assistance. It is that kind of community involvement that makes our campus a safer place for all students, faculty, staff and visitors.
For those of you who are still on campus during the break, please remember that the University Police Department remains open 24 hours a day. Additionally, our student patrol and security guard staff members are available to provide SafeWalks after 9 p.m. throughout the break, except for Thanksgiving night.
As always, thank you for your active involvement in the security of our campus community. On behalf of the Division of Public Safety, I wish you all a safe and happy Thanksgiving holiday.
Sincerely,
Craig A. StoneExecutive Director of Public Safety and Chief of Police"

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This Campus Safety Notice is issued in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about crime to aid in the prevention of similar crimes and to assist in the identification of offenders.
This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, you can view the daily crime log.
The following attempted robbery took place at 11:56 p.m. Tuesday, Nov. 26, outside of the Illini Union, 1401 W. Green St., (map) in Urbana:
A U. of I. student was standing near the main entrance of the Illini Union when he was approached by two people. One of the offenders said to the student, “I like your backpack,” and pulled at it. The second individual struck the student. The offenders then ran from the area. The student was not seriously injured, and nothing was stolen.
Images of the suspects, one of whom was wearing a mask, were obtained from security cameras following the incident. You can view those images here: https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/7513/804804
The University of Illinois Police Department has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area, and we are fortunate to have our force supplemented by the Urbana and Champaign police departments. Between these agencies, the Urbana campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 1,900 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android. All messages to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of identifying information and forwarded to police by an independent third party.
This is our community. Let's stay together.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks escort if you need one.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 9-1-1 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.
If you choose to consume alcohol, please be responsible. Remember your ability to respond is diminished by overconsumption of alcohol.

2019-11-21T15:44:00Z,2019-11-21,15:44,34664,You're Invited: Student Success Initiative,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28716.html,"Dear students,
In September, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign launched our university-wide Student Success Initiative, an effort to better identify the factors that lead to positive and productive experiences for our undergraduate students. The initiative was launched at a kick-off event on September 16 that was attended by approximately 270 students, faculty, and staff. Participants provided feedback on what “student success” means to them and what we do well and where there are gaps on our campus in programs and services that factor into these definitions.
Subsequent to this event, we have held four lunch sessions this month to dig deeper into the themes that arose from the kick-off feedback. Building on those lunch sessions, we write to invite you to a dinner session specifically for students.

Today, the Board of Trustees approved recommendations from a task force that spent the last year examining how we can hone our collective efforts to continue building a system-wide culture rooted in healthy relationships and free from sexual misconduct in any form.
It was a deep dive led by your peers. The 16-member task force, chaired by Executive Vice President Barb Wilson, brought together faculty, staff and students from across our universities. Their holistic review covered everything from policies and investigations to education and training, along with best practices among our peers and new approaches grounded in current research.
The result is a thorough and thoughtful roadmap with an overarching goal of establishing and reinforcing a culture that “allows all members of our university communities to learn, study, explore and work in spaces that are free from sexual misconduct.”
The recommendations approved by the board include creating new system-wide policies on faculty-student relationships, expanding education and training for faculty, staff and students, and launching new programs to gauge the impact of our efforts. They are outlined in a task force summary and in the news release below, and we will continue to consult stakeholders across the system as the task force develops the new policies and programs.
I am grateful to the task force for steering us forward, to the board for its support and to our faculty, staff and students across the system for your commitment to the vision of the future that we all share.
Sincerely,
Tim

U of I trustees approve sexual misconduct prevention measures Task force proposals promote culture of learning, safety, success
CHICAGO – The University of Illinois Board of Trustees on Thursday approved a series of recommendations by a system-wide task force that spent the last year developing a holistic approach to prevent sexual misconduct and foster a culture that ensures safety, learning and success. 
The recommendations will create new policies across the system’s three universities that further restrict faculty-student relationships, require background checks for sexual misconduct in hiring, and prohibit separation agreements with departing employees that call for withholding any sexual misconduct findings against them. 
Other recommendations will expand education and training for employees and students, with a focus on prevention, awareness and building a culture free of misconduct. New follow-up programs also will be developed to evaluate the system’s collective efforts, gauge impact and chart new approaches.
“These recommendations reflect our commitment to healthy relationships and safe campus communities where everyone can study, work, learn and explore – free from sexual misconduct or harassment in any form,” said Tim Killeen, president of the U of I System. “I am grateful to the members of the task force for sharing their time and talents to push us toward our ambitious goals.”
Recommendations approved by trustees were made by a task force that Killeen appointed last fall to take a broad-based look at current policies and practices involving sexual misconduct, a concern on college campuses nationally. The 16-member task force, comprised of faculty, staff and students from across the system, was chaired by Executive Vice President Barbara Wilson.
“Our Board of Trustees has made it a clear priority to address and prevent sexual misconduct and harassment at our universities,” said Chairman Don Edwards. “A completely safe environment for our students to learn and to prosper is essential to our academic mission, and we will work continuously toward that goal. The board is thankful to Executive Vice President Wilson and the task force for their thoughtful work, and we look forward to these new policies being implemented expeditiously.”
One policy authorized by the board will expand the prohibition of sexual or amorous relationships between faculty and students. Faculty will be prohibited from relationships with any undergraduate student, with any graduate or professional student in the same academic department or unit, or with any other student over whom they have supervisory or evaluative authority, such as teaching or research assistants. Current policy generally prohibits faculty from relationships with students in their classroom or under their supervision. Staff members also will be prohibited from having sexual or amorous relationships with students over whom they have academic, extracurricular or workplace authority.
Another policy seeks to prevent potential abusers from joining faculty and staff of the system’s universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield. The new policy would require all finalists for employment to allow their current and former employers to release any past findings of sexual misconduct.
A third policy will preserve the system’s right to share misconduct findings on a limited basis within and across the system when employees are considered for promotions or new professional opportunities. The policy will prohibit separation agreements with confidentiality or non-disclosure provisions that would limit release of misconduct findings.
Though central to the system’s efforts, the task force report says creating a culture free of misconduct “requires far more than a modification of policies and punishments. The focus must be on educating our faculty, staff and students so as to foster a sense of collective responsibility for creating, nurturing and protecting healthy work and educational environments across our units.”
The task force recommends building on mandatory annual employee training related to sexual misconduct, with an emphasis on prevention and culture as well as compliance with law. Student training also should be expanded, with a focus on real-world issues such as effectively communicating about consent in relationships, avoiding unhealthy relationships, intervening to prevent misconduct and the heightened risks posed by alcohol and drugs.
Ongoing evaluation research is recommended to assess the occurrence and nature of the misconduct, as well as the effectiveness and impact of education and training programs. Analyzing incidents and programs will help refine the system’s efforts, and should include recurring climate surveys to gauge overall progress toward its goals.
The task force worked in concert with two committees in Urbana-Champaign that looked into campus-specific issues involving misconduct. The system initiative provided recommendations that will apply to all three universities.

As chancellor, it is my responsibility to annually reaffirm our campus commitment to equal opportunity, affirmative action, and equal access. The campus is committed to creating and maintaining a community that recognizes and values the inherent worth and dignity of every person, while fostering an environment of mutual respect among its members.
Diversity within the University of Illinois advances the academic purposes of the university. An affirmative action plan is essential to achieving diversity. As a part of our affirmative action plan, consistent with state and federal laws, we undertake good faith efforts to increase the representation of women, minorities, persons with disabilities, and veterans.
University policies prohibit discrimination and harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, disability, national origin, citizenship status, ancestry, age, order of protection status, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation including gender identity, arrest record status, unfavorable discharge from the military or status as a protected veteran. These protections extend to all members of the campus community during any stage of the employment process. This includes, but is not limited to, recruitment, selection, promotion, transfer, merit increases, salary, training and development, demotion, and separation. Similarly, the university prohibits discrimination in admissions, enrollment, and provision of services, programs, and activities.
Please contact the Office for Access & Equity at accessandequity@illinois.edu if you have questions about our university policies and for assistance with discrimination, harassment, affirmative action, and disability related matters. The university’s nondiscrimination policy, procedures, and protocols are available online.
While Illinois and higher education institutions around the country continue to await further guidance on Title IX and sexual misconduct from the U.S. Department of Education, we want to assure the campus community that the State of Illinois law, Preventing Sexual Violence in Higher Education, remains in effect. In recognition of the continued importance in acting to eliminate sexual misconduct, Illinois has implemented a requirement that all new students will complete online sexual misconduct prevention training. Additionally, it is the expectation of this university that all students complete this training annually. More information about annual sexual misconduct prevention training is available on the We Care website. 
We want to emphasize our promise to continue to provide optimal services, support, resources, and guidance to address sexual misconduct in our community. Our responsibility to ensure the safety of our students, staff, and faculty will not change. We remain vigilant in responding to sexual misconduct while affirming due process, fairness, and dignity. We will be steadfast in our response and treat all matters with urgency while working to provide survivors with the many available campus resources.
Danielle Morrison, our Title IX and Disability Coordinator, provides oversight and support for the university’s comprehensive Title IX programs and initiatives. These programs and initiatives ensure compliance with university policies, state laws, and federal laws related to sexual discrimination and misconduct. Dr. Morrison can be reached at titleixcoordinator@illinois.edu or (844) 616-7978. 
Please visit the We Care website (wecare.illinois.edu), to learn more about confidential and non-confidential resources, university policies, disciplinary procedures, rights and options, and additional information related to the prevention, reporting, and response to sexual misconduct. Questions regarding Title IX may also be sent to the U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights. 
Realizing our shared vision of an inclusive campus requires that we all annually reaffirm our individual commitment. Together we will build a truly diverse, welcoming, and inclusive community of students, scholars and staff. Please join me in affirming your individual commitment to creating and maintaining an inclusive campus community. 
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

We write today to share the report we commissioned from the Consensual Relationship Policy Task Force. You can access the report here.
We want to thank the task force members for working collaboratively and deliberatively to develop their recommendations for a new, more detailed and clear policy governing faculty-student consensual relationships on our campus. The report outlines the components of the recommended new policy in detail with significant discussion of the research and reasoning that informed the task force’s work.
The task force members brought diverse backgrounds and competing perspectives to the process. And they actively and regularly sought the advice of stakeholders across the university. Groups consulted include the Provost’s Undergraduate Student Advisory Board, the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, the Committee on Faculty Sexual Misconduct and several standing committees of the Academic Senate.
We are committed to working with Senate leadership and campus stakeholders to begin the process of refining and implementing the recommendations. We will also work with the System-wide Task Force on Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Response in that process so as to ensure consistency. We are beginning to schedule conversations with key stakeholder groups across our university, and we will follow the appropriate processes and procedures to make these policy changes.
Maintaining the highest standards of academic integrity and professionalism is critical to our institutional mission. Having a clear and carefully constructed policy on consensual relationships between the university’s faculty members or other instructors and its students, will help us achieve the very high standards our state and nation expect from us.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

I am happy to share the news that we have released our second set of Guiding Principles, adding an important new layer to the foundation of core values that define us.
The new Guiding Principles join three others adopted two years ago, building on the ideals that we hold most dear and expanding the touchstone that will guide our future. The three additions reflect our bedrock commitment to a culture of excellence rooted in integrity, to financial and environmental sustainability, and to fostering the healthy relationships that allow every member of our campus communities to flourish.
Those relationships are at the center of everything we do, and the new principles ensure that we never lose sight of our responsibility to nurture a spirit of inclusion where people of all races, cultures, backgrounds and faiths are respected and embraced. Our universities share a fundamental commitment to personal dignity, tolerance and a learning environment free of bias, prejudice or discrimination.  Our campuses work hard to provide a climate of understanding and acceptance, allowing students to follow their dreams in an educational setting that is free of bullying, harassment or sexual misconduct and without fear of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia or any other expression of hatred or division.
Like the inaugural set of Guiding Principles that laid out our position on free speech, globalization and immigration, and civic engagement, our latest principles were developed through a thoughtful, inclusive process. Hundreds of you helped shape them, including our Board of Trustees and faculty, staff, students and leadership from our universities and system offices.
The full set of six Guiding Principles is posted on our website and I hope you will take time to review them and incorporate their vision into your studies, your jobs and your lives. My thanks to everyone who shared their talents to reaffirm our unwavering commitment to serve the needs of students and the public good.

I am pleased to announce that Susan A. Martinis has accepted my offer to become the vice chancellor for research and innovation at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, pending approval by the Board of Trustees.
When I first announced that Dr. Martinis would serve as interim vice chancellor for research in September 2017, I said she had earned a reputation at Illinois as a collaborative scholar and consultative leader who gets work done.
That reputation has only grown in the past two years. Since taking on the role, Dr. Martinis has provided stellar performance, collegiality, creativity and agility in leading some of the most complex and pioneering activities in the Urbana-Champaign research enterprise. Her accomplishments during this period are impressive, and the addition of “innovation” to the VCR title reflects the breadth of her portfolio and scope of her impact.
As interim vice chancellor for research, Dr. Martinis oversaw the evolution of three large-scale initiatives: the Cancer Center at Illinois and the Center for Social and Behavioral Sciences became the 8th and 9th university-wide research centers, while the Illinois Program for Research in the Humanities is on track to become an IBHE-approved institute. She led the transition of the Research Park and EnterpriseWorks back to the Urbana-Champaign campus, was named the senior leadership point-of-contact for the Discovery Partners Institute and the Illinois Innovation Network and chairs the Chancellor’s Economic Development Advisory Group. Dr. Martinis also oversaw strengthening of the business infrastructure that supports the Illinois research community, uniting pre- and post-award functions under one administrative umbrella and implementing an electronic proposal routing system.
Dr. Martinis is a dedicated educator and an experienced administrator, researcher and entrepreneur. She is an asset to Illinois and has been a strong and creative leader for our Illinois research and innovation enterprise. We are thrilled to see her accept this role. Please join me in congratulating Dr. Martinis.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This Campus Safety Notice is issued in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about crime to aid in the prevention of similar crimes and to assist in the identification of offenders.
The following robbery took place at about 12:42 a.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 7, in the 1400 block of West Gregory Drive, (map) in Urbana:
A U. of I. student was walking on the South Quad when he was approached by two people who struck him in the face and took his cellphone. No weapons were seen during the incident, and the student was not seriously injured.
The offenders were about 6-feet tall and skinny, and they were wearing bandanas with the hoods of their sweatshirts pulled over their faces. No additional information about the offenders was provided.
The University of Illinois Police Department has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area, and we are fortunate to have our force supplemented by the Urbana and Champaign police departments. Between these agencies, the Urbana campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 1,800 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android. All messages to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of identifying information and forwarded to police by an independent third party.
This is our community. Let's stay together.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks escort if you need one.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 9-1-1 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.
If you choose to consume alcohol, please be responsible. Remember your ability to respond is diminished by overconsumption of alcohol.

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes on or immediately adjacent to campus property.
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes. To protect victims’ privacy, we generally do not include specific details about exact locations or times to avoid releasing information that could lead to the identification of a survivor and cause further harm to that person.
The University of Illinois Police Department has received a report that a woman was sexually assaulted in the early morning on Friday, Oct. 25, at a university residence hall. The offender is not a person known to the victim.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to assist those involved in this incident and will continue to take actions to maintain the safety and security of the campus community.
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.
If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another person, intervene if it’s safe to do so or call for assistance.
While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. The university, community organizations and local law enforcement offer a number of reporting options.
Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.
It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.

We write today to share the report we commissioned from the Committee on Faculty Sexual Misconduct. You can access the report here.
We want to thank the committee members for working diligently and tirelessly to produce this comprehensive set of recommendations for changes to our policies, processes and practices regulating harassment and misconduct.
Our goal is to build a campus climate that is intolerant of sexual harassment and that empowers every member of our university community in their pursuit of their careers, lives and educations.
The proposals contained in the report are designed to increase the transparency of our processes and allow us to respond to sexual misconduct more expeditiously. These recommendations also suggest broader tools – including sanctions and other responsive measures – to address sexual misconduct.
Committee members had diverse backgrounds and competing perspectives. They were encouraged to represent these perspectives vigorously but to search for creative solutions that could garner unanimous consensus. The Committee reached out to other stakeholders for input when special expertise or representation was needed.
Groups they consulted include the Exploratory Group on Campus Culture, Climate, and Sexual Misconduct, the Committee on Faculty-Student Consensual Relations and the Committee on Graduate Student Mentoring. Throughout the process, the Committee stayed in close contact with the University of Illinois System Task Force on Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Response to ensure coordination of their efforts.
We are committed to working with Senate leadership and campus stakeholders to begin the process of refining and implementing the recommendations. We will work with the System-wide Task Force in that process so as to ensure consistency, where appropriate, across the three University of Illinois System universities. We are beginning to schedule conversations with key stakeholder groups across our university, and we will follow the appropriate process and procedures to make these policy changes.
We have the responsibility to be leaders in higher education and to create a framework that leads to a cultural change where policies and processes to address misconduct align with the values of respect and safety we all hold.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

2019-10-09T19:38:00Z,2019-10-09,19:38,73698,Addressing Anti-Semitism,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28689.html,"Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
I am disheartened to share news of more incidents that challenge our fundamental values of tolerance and inclusion.
On Monday, a swastika was found in the Foreign Languages Building. An investigation has been launched and is on-going.
In addition, concerns were raised about a recent presentation with anti-Semitic content at a staff development program by a Housing student-worker. Housing staff have been meeting individually with all who were present to understand fully the presentation and the nature of the conversations that followed.
I want to state publicly and unequivocally that acts and expressions of anti-Semitism are acts and expressions of hatred and discrimination that are in direct opposition to our core values. Bias and prejudice are antithetical to the educational foundations of our university and hurtful to our entire community. The idea that any individual feels threatened for expression of personal religious or ethnic identity is unacceptable. We will always recognize the rights of those on the campus to safely and freely express their perspectives and opinions. But we will also be ready to condemn statements and actions that violate our shared values and seek to demean, intimidate or devalue others in our community.
This presentation was offered in a regularly scheduled, staff development program on diversity for Housing Resident Advisors that included 11 other student-employees and one full-time staff member. This exercise was part of a university program created to help students learn to share diverse ideas and perspectives that lead to new understanding. Instead of fostering dialogue, it incited division, distrust and anger. The program allowed our students to enter an extremely challenging and potentially volatile situation without the preparation, training, education and professional oversight they needed to succeed. This is inexcusable and unacceptable. This is a failure to our students, and that is my responsibility.
I apologize to all of our students and to our community. This university promises an experience that prepares students to live, work and lead in a multicultural, diverse and international society. We did not live up to our obligations in this case. We are taking immediate action to ensure that, going forward, our programs and initiatives position our students for success.
Those actions include:
The Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs has initiated an immediate, full review of the hiring, training and professional oversight and management processes of our Resident Advisors and Multicultural Advocates.
We are instituting anti-Semitism training for all full-time Housing staff, Resident Advisors and Multicultural Advocates. This training will be in place by the end of this semester.
We will commission an external review of our University Housing multicultural educational programs to help us identify and to implement best practices based on leading national peers.
I want to assure all of our students, staff, faculty and community that we are fully conscious of the seriousness of incidents of anti-Semitism, racism, bias and prejudice on this university. We will continue to track, investigate and address incidents swiftly.
The work of creating an inclusive environment is everyone’s responsibility. I am committed to continuing to work with faculty, students and staff to create a positive climate.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

In order to maintain an effective emergency response and evacuation plan, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign recently completed a test including two components: a drill and an exercise. The test was designed to challenge our emergency response procedures and how we notify you of a threat to our campus community.
On Sept. 3, we initiated a test of our Illini-Alert emergency notification system. The drill was announced ahead of time by a mass email to campus and an Eweek notice to faculty and staff. The Illini-Alert system sent an email to the campus email addresses of all active students, faculty and staff. Those who have registered alternate email addresses also received a notification. Those who have registered a cellphone number were sent a text message during this drill.
Illini-Alert messages are also posted to Facebook, Twitter, digital signage and on campus websites through our Emergency Web Alert System. This approach increases the speed and breadth of our distribution of emergency notifications, and it provides a robust communication engine that will continue to function successfully even if one system fails to work properly.
For the second component, university personnel and emergency responders from a number of local agencies gathered for a functional exercise on Sept. 27 from 8 a.m. to noon at the Illinois Fire Service Institute. Those involved were presented with a scenario involving a natural disaster that directly affected campus. The exercise tested various components of the Campus Emergency Operations Plan, including evacuation procedures.
This test was conducted to ensure we have a robust response plan in the event of a campus emergency, and that our emergency notifications will reach you in a timely and effective manner. If you have not signed up to receive emergency messages through Illini-Alert, please visit emergency.illinois.edu to register.
To view the University’s emergency response and evacuation procedures, please visit go.illinois.edu/EmergencyResponse.
The University of Illinois Police Department is committed to maintaining a safe and secure campus environment where education, research and public service can flourish. We can only do so with the assistance of our community, and we hope this information is useful to all of our campus partners.
Sincerely,
Lieutenant Todd ShortUniversity of Illinois Police DepartmentOffice of Campus Emergency Management"
2019-09-28T04:30:00Z,2019-09-28,4:30,72593,Illinois Alcohol and Other Drugs (AOD) Prevention Program,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28682.html,"Dear Students and Employees,
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. For the University to be in compliance with Federal Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Regulations we are required to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:
http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/
The program webpage was prepared in accordance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989. It describes the University’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse, makes clear the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard, and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and provides university and community resources to help with drug or alcohol related problems.
As a reminder, under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that Act and the federal Drug Free Schools and Communities Act and the Drug Free Workplace Act, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on University property or as part of any University activity. The passage of the Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act in 2019, which legalizes certain activities related to marijuana under Illinois state law effective January 1, 2020, does not affect federal law or the university’s marijuana prohibition. 
In addition, the university’s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on University property (this includes but is not limited to outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any University activity.
The university’s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and all new employees in accordance with federal guidelines, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources included on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.
Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. University employees should contact Illinois Human Resources at (217) 333-2137.
Sincerely,
Dr. Danita M. B. YoungVice Chancellor for Student Affairs"
2019-09-27T18:50:00Z,2019-09-27,18:50,72619,Community Safety Notice,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28681.html,"Dear campus community member:
We are writing to make you aware of number of concerning incidents involving inappropriate touching which have occurred during the first several weeks of this fall semester. None of these incidents have resulted in physical injuries, and the majority have occurred in off-campus areas. We nevertheless wanted to provide you with the following information so you can take the appropriate steps to protect yourself and others.
Between Aug. 24 and Sept. 18, a total of eight incidents of inappropriate touching or public indecency have been reported to three separate police agencies in our area, including the Champaign Police Department, Urbana Police Department and the University of Illinois Police Department. One person was arrested on Sept. 22 and charged with public indecency in connection with one of those incidents. Preliminary investigation suggests that other individuals are responsible for the remaining incidents, and that not all of the incidents are related to each other.
Between the dates these crimes were reported and today, we have been unable to release information as they are the focus of an active investigation. However, there has been an enhanced police presence to keep our community members safe in areas where the incidents occurred.
The locations, dates and additional information regarding each of these incidents are detailed in a map on the University of Illinois Police Department website: https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/7513/803088
These incidents remain under investigation by all three departments, and we intend to provide you with updates when appropriate. Police officers from area departments are patrolling the campus area and are on the lookout for suspicious behavior.
Although no one has been physically injured, these incidents reinforce the importance of observing some important safety tips for keeping ourselves and others safe:
Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks escort if you need one.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it does not feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we are happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 9-1-1 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.
Do not allow strangers to follow you into your building. It may seem polite to hold the door for someone, but that often allows unauthorized people to enter. It is OK to ask someone to swipe their card to enter a residence hall.
Anyone with information about these incidents is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android. All messages to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of identifying information and forwarded to police by an independent third party.
As always, thank you for being an active participant in the safety of our campus community, and for taking steps to look out for yourself and others.
Sincerely,
Craig A. StoneExecutive Director of Public Safety and Chief of Police"

A possible, though low probability, case of mumps has been reported on campus.
McKinley Health Center has notified students and instructors in the Chemistry Department regarding possible exposure.
An information link is included below for your information. 
If you believe you may have mumps: we encourage you to seek medical care at McKinley Health Center.
http://mckinley.illinois.edu/sites/default/files/docs/mumps.pdf
As you know, the single best way to prevent spread of infectious illness is to wash your hands.
Since mumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person, persons may prevent contracting mumps with a few simple actions:
Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, and throw the tissue away after use.
Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. If water is not near, use an alcohol-based hand cleaner.
Do not share eating and/or drinking utensils.
Refrain from close contact with individuals who are sick/experiencing symptoms.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. (Germs are often spread when a person touches something that is contaminated with germs and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.)
In situations such as this, the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District, area hospitals, and McKinley Health Center work closely together to ensure the safety of the campus and the community.
Additional information will be shared with the campus as it becomes available.

2019-09-05T18:04:00Z,2019-09-05,18:4,83515,Update on Residence Hall Incident,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28667.html,"Dear students, faculty and staff,
As you may know, this past Sunday morning, a noose was found in a residence hall elevator. The University of Illinois Police Department made an arrest Monday.
Regardless of the intent behind this incident, the fact that we are confronted by a symbol with such intense racist and violent connections is a difficult reminder of the damage that hatred and intolerance inflict on our entire community. To those like myself, who grew up in the South when Jim Crow laws were still in full force, this incident recalls memories of senseless violence and horrific acts carried out in the name of racist hatred. It is extremely upsetting that, more than a half century later, we are still facing symbols of hate that force another generation to ask why the color of your skin, the religion you practice or where your parents came from should make you a target of anyone’s anger or distrust.
We will not tolerate racism here at Illinois. We will not tolerate bigotry here at Illinois. We will not tolerate discrimination here at Illinois. We are committed to creating a university free of acts of intolerance, bias or prejudice. Incidents like this one remind us how much work remains for all of us to see that these words are always and truly practiced here at this university.
Housing staff and the University of Illinois Police Department (UIPD) responded quickly to this incident. UIPD immediately began an investigation that led to Monday’s arrest of a student. In addition to being subject to potential criminal prosecution, possible violations of the student code by individuals are also reviewed by our own Office for Student Conflict Resolution to determine any appropriate disciplinary action. The student is currently not allowed on campus property. 
We did communicate the incident to all students in our residence halls along with information about how they could access support resources. Additionally, the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion have begun a series of meeting opportunities to allow students safe places to discuss the incident and any concerns they have.
We aspire to be a beacon of inclusion and excellence. I want to assure all of our students, staff and faculty that we are fully conscious of the seriousness of incidents like this and the chilling effect they have on every single thing we do here. We will continue to use all of our resources to investigate and address incidents as quickly as possible.
The work of creating an inclusive environment is everyone’s responsibility. Whether faculty, students or staff, we each have a role to play in creating a positive climate. And we will endeavor to more broadly share news of incidents of intolerance and racism that occur on the campus in order to ensure that our entire community can come together to make everyone who comes here feel welcomed and respected.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

In an effort to further enhance our cyber defenses, we want to remind you of a common cyber-attack that everyone should be aware of – phishing.
""Phishing"" is the most common type of cyber-attack that affects individuals and organizations. Phishing attacks can take many forms, but they all have a common goal – getting you to mistakenly disclose sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card information, or bank account details.
Although we maintain security controls, provide awareness training, and conduct phishing simulations and tests to help protect our campus community from cyber threats, we need your help as the first line of defense.
What You Can Do
To avoid these phishing schemes, please observe the following best practices:
Avoid clicking links or attachments from senders that you do not recognize. Be especially wary of .zip or other compressed or executable file types.
Never provide sensitive personal information (like usernames and passwords, Social Security Numbers, financial information) over email.
Watch for email senders that use suspicious or misleading domain names.  Look closely at the email address of the sender.
Beware of any shared document that you’re not expecting to receive.
Be especially cautious if you receive an email containing a warning banner indicating that it originated from an external source.
If you are unsure if an email is legitimate or not, please contact your local IT support or the Technology Services Help Desk, 217-244-7000 or consult@illinois.edu.
Thanks again for helping to keep our network, and our people, safe from these cyber threats.
Regards,
Joe BarnesChief Privacy & Security OfficerUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"

We are excited to announce the launch of a university-wide Student Success Initiative, an effort to better identify the factors that lead to positive and productive experiences for our undergraduate students.
From the classroom to academic advising to co-curricular programs and student support services, each of you play an important role in ensuring we are providing the best experience for our students. We need your participation. I hope you will join your colleagues from across campus at the Student Success Initiative kickoff event:

2019-08-28T16:36:00Z,2019-08-28,16:36,83444,Community Safety Notice,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28664.html,"Dear campus community member:
As we start the semester, we would like to take a moment to remind you of some tips and resources for keeping yourself and your property safe. We have a very safe campus. However, no community is entirely free of crime.
In the past several weeks, a higher than usual number of burglaries to residences and vehicles have been reported to the Champaign Police Department in areas close to campus. In the majority of these cases, the offender accessed the vehicle or residence through an unlocked door.
We need your assistance to prevent these crimes. Thieves seek opportunities to access your personal property by looking for unlocked doors. The best way to prevent property crime is to lock doors at all times. Always lock up your apartment, residence hall rooms, vehicles and bicycles. Valuables like wallets, cellphones and backpacks should always be kept out of sight and never left unattended in public places like libraries or gyms.
In addition to locking your doors and securing your valuables, it is important to remember some general tips for keeping yourself safe:
Always walk in groups, and use well-lit, high traffic routes. Call SafeWalks at 217-333-1216 if you need a Student Patrol escort when traveling at night.
Do not allow people to follow you into secure locations. If someone tries to follow you into your residence hall or apartment building, request that they use their own key or swipe card to gain entry.
Trust your instincts, and report any unusual or suspicious activity. Even small pieces of information can prevent a crime and help protect yourself and others.
State law and university procedures provide amnesty for 9-1-1 callers. If you or someone else is in need of emergency assistance, neither the caller nor the person in need will be cited for underage liquor violations.
The University of Illinois Police Department and surrounding law enforcement agencies work hard to keep campus safe. However, we cannot do it alone. We need your help to look out for yourselves and each other. Thank you for being an active participant in the safety of our community, and we wish you a safe and wonderful fall semester.
Sincerely,
Craig A. StoneExecutive Director of Public Safety and Chief of Police"

2019-08-20T11:32:00Z,2019-08-20,11:32,82149,Smoke and Tobacco Free Campus,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28658.html,"Dear Campus Community,
Last fall, I announced that the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign would become 100 percent smoke and tobacco-free in August 2019. I am writing to remind you that this new policy is now currently in place. The new effort builds upon the smoke-free policy that was successfully implemented in 2014, banning the use of all smoke-producing tobacco products on campus. The new smoke-and-tobacco free policy applies to everyone – students, faculty, staff, students and visitors.
It includes all forms of tobacco, including but not limited to chewing tobacco, snuff, snus and dissolvable forms such as orbs and strips. Vaping devices such as e-cigarettes and juuls are still prohibited. The banned locations include all campus-owned property (PDF) – indoors and outdoors – as well as private vehicles parked on campus-owned property. 
Since Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the law legalizing recreational marijuana beginning Jan. 1, we have received many questions about the use of marijuana at our university. The use or possession of marijuana will still be prohibited on campus when the law goes into effect. These university marijuana policies comply with federal law, including the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989.
For more information about the smoke-and-tobacco free policy, please see the Campus Administrative Manual and visit the Smoke and Tobacco Free website. To help faculty, staff and students adapt to the new policy, the campus will continue offering a variety of tobacco-cessation programs through McKinley Health Center and Campus Wellbeing Services.
I ask everyone to respect our new policy to create a healthy environment for our entire university community.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

Please be advised that MCORE Project 4 road construction on the west side of Wright Street from Chalmers Street to Green Street will continue through December. Alternate access routes will be maintained for buildings along the corridor at all times, but rerouting around the area is strongly encouraged.
This summer, MCORE project segments were completed along Armory Avenue from Fourth Street to Wright Street, as well as parts of Wright Street. A current project map with accessible pedestrian routes and building entrances is available.
Several significant sidewalk and bike pathway closures are also in place related to capital improvement projects in the following locations:
Bardeen Quad (Campus Instructional Facility)
Fourth Street (Siebel Center for Design at Illinois)
Mathews Street (Civil Engineering Hydrosystems Laboratory)
Southwest of Allen Hall (Red Oak Rain Garden reinstallation)
All approved closures on the Urbana campus, including maps and contact information, are posted on the Facilities & Services website. Approved closures are implemented following a carefully coordinated review of each request by F&S to establish alternate circulation routes in the best interest of pedestrian safety, accessibility, and minimizing potential conflicts for all transportation modes.

We are delighted to announce a unique new educational program that is being launched this fall for our nearly 20,000 academic professional and civil service employees. For employees in positions represented by a union, this program will be adopted through the collective bargaining process.
Our faculty and staff are the foundation of the University of Illinois System’s standing as a global leader in education and discovery. Their daily hard work and dedication are the building blocks of our efforts to serve communities, the state of Illinois and the nation. Yet it is challenging for many staff to fully appreciate just what their talents have helped build – three universities whose academic excellence has attracted a record 86,000 students; a collective research powerhouse that ranks among the world’s most innovative university systems; a system that pumps $17.5 billion into the state’s economy every year, supporting one in every 46 jobs.
So we have developed a unique new program to give staff an opportunity for a first-hand look at the big picture. Know Your U is perhaps the first program of its kind in the country, offering eligible university employees time away during their normal workday to experience the remarkable programs and facilities that their hard work supports. It is a chance to learn more about academic units that have helped set enrollment records for six straight years; about research that promises to build on the system’s long, rich legacy of groundbreaking innovation; and about the iconic facilities that define our three, best-in-class universities.
More information is available on the Know Your U website and also will be emailed to employees by university and system human resource offices. Our human resource staff was instrumental in developing the program, and we are grateful for their commitment, creativity and good work.
Know Your U is an investment in our most valuable resource, giving staff employees a broader perspective into the scope and impact of our universities, and how their roles contribute to the greater good. We also hope they have some fun along the way, and walk away with an even greater sense of pride in a university system that is truly altogether extraordinary.

I am pleased to introduce Sean C. Garrick as the first vice chancellor for diversity, equity and inclusion at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His appointment will be effective Aug. 1, pending approval by the Board of Trustees.
Dr. Garrick is currently the associate vice provost in the office for equity and diversity at the University of Minnesota, where he leads initiatives designed to recruit, retain and sustain a diverse community of scholars. As the director of the University of Minnesota Institute for Diversity, Equity and Advocacy, he leads efforts to engage faculty members whose scholarship focuses on diverse, underrepresented or marginalized populations.
Dr. Garrick has been instrumental in creating and overseeing dynamic programs that recruit, retain and advance the success of diverse students and faculty at all five University of Minnesota campuses. His commitment to increasing student interest and persistence in STEM fields began when he was in graduate school, and he currently works with an interdisciplinary group of faculty and staff focused on middle school interventions designed to increase the number of students enrolling in college.
He is also an accomplished scholar and a professor of mechanical engineering with a research focus on chemically reacting flows, particle formation and growth, and turbulent, multiphase flows. Dr. Garrick holds three degrees from the State University of New York at Buffalo—a bachelor’s degree, master’s degree and Ph.D. in mechanical engineering.
I want to thank the search committee, co-chaired by Vice Chancellor Danita Brown Young and Dean James Anderson, for its careful work in recruiting and evaluating an outstanding selection of applicants and in guiding the search process over the past months. I also want to express my gratitude to each of you in the campus community who offered advice and honest feedback about the final candidates.
When I began as chancellor at Illinois, I said that I believed hiring a vice chancellor for diversity, equity and inclusion was critical to our success. Dr. Garrick has the passion, experience and leadership necessary to integrate our robust and numerous diversity and inclusion efforts into innovative strategies and practices that enhance these efforts and embed them into every aspect of our missions.
I want to express my deep appreciation to Dr. Nancy “Rusty” Barcelo for her service and leadership as special assistant to the chancellor for diversity and for establishing a strong foundation that allowed us to attract a leader of Dr. Garrick’s caliber.
I hope you will join me in congratulating Dr. Garrick once he arrives on campus in his new role at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

The Chancellor’s Commission on Native Imagery: Healing and Reconciliation has completed the work it began this past winter and has delivered its final report to me. 
The report is posted at http://go.illinois.edu/2019CommissionReport. I invite you to take a few minutes to read their suggestions and observations.
The Commission was comprised of two co-chairs and 12 members representing the broad experiences of students, faculty members, staff, alumni and athletics, including Indigenous university stakeholders and former portrayers of Chief Illiniwek.
I want to thank the members of the Commission for their thoughtful work this year. They have fulfilled the charge I gave them in a balanced and consultative manner. Their frank and open discussions and their careful consideration of the opinions and viewpoints expressed by University students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends led to observations and advice that will be extremely helpful as I determine our next steps.  
The Commission met monthly between November and April. In addition to discussions in those sessions, the members drew from the perspectives raised in communitywide critical conversations in spring 2018 and also considered the more than 2,000 informal online survey responses on the intent and impact of the portrayal of Chief Illiniwek.
I want to thank all the members of the Commission for their efforts and for their expediency. Their work has led us to what I truly believe is a new path forward.

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is committed to creating a safe environment for everyone who participates in programs on our campus, including those who are under the age of 18. As summer activities begin, we would like to remind faculty and staff about the university policy on protection of minors and our procedures for implementing that policy. You can find more information on those items by following the below links.
Protection of minors policy: http://go.illinois.edu/POMpolicy
Procedures for implementing the policy: https://cam.illinois.edu/policies/hr-64/
These procedures outline requirements that apply to all members of our university community, including university personnel, volunteers and contractors associated with events and activities where minors will be involved. Units with programs or activities designed to include minors who are not enrolled at the university are required report those activities to the University of Illinois Police Department at http://go.illinois.edu/POMform. External entities or Registered Student Organizations may report activities using a shortened version of this form which can be found at http://go.illinois.edu/POM-short-form.

We are pleased by the strong support for the University of Illinois System and public higher education across the state in the fiscal year 2020 budget approved by the Illinois legislature and sent to the governor, who is expected to sign it into law.
The budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 would provide the U of I System’s largest appropriation increase since fiscal 2001, almost two decades ago. Funding would grow by nearly 5 percent, or $27.4 million, in line with the increase that Gov. J.B. Pritzker recommended for day-to-day operations at our three universities in his budget proposal earlier this year.
In addition, the budget re-appropriates capital funding to support key construction projects at our universities. It also re-appropriates $500 million for development of our Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) and Illinois Innovation Network (IIN), pioneering education and research initiatives that will accelerate the breakthroughs that drive progress and economic growth.
Highlights of the budget include:
An appropriation of $622 million for operations, up 4.6 percent from the current fiscal year. It would be our largest year-to-year increase since fiscal 2001.
Re-appropriation for bricks-and-mortar projects across the system, including the Advanced Chemical Technology Building at UIC and Public Safety Building at UIS.
Re-appropriation of $500 million in capital funding for planning and construction of DPI, a new research center in downtown Chicago, and 15 IIN research hubs across the state, including one at each of our universities and satellite campuses.
Statewide, $451 million for the Monetary Award Program (MAP), up $50 million or 12.5 percent from the current fiscal year. MAP provides financial aid to support Illinois students, including thousands across the U of I System.
An additional $10 million for the second year of a state scholarship program created to encourage in-state students to attend college in Illinois and stem an outmigration of talent to other states. The U of I System and other universities provide matching funds to double the impact of the state’s contribution.
If the House concurs with a $45 billion public works construction program approved by the Senate, the U of I System would also be in line for $686 million to fund capital improvements at all three universities. Major projects include renovation of Altgeld Hall for a math, statistics and data science collaboration center in Urbana-Champaign; an initiative involving quantum information sciences and technology that Urbana is developing in partnership with the University of Chicago, Argonne and FermiLab; a computer design research and learning center for UIC’s College of Engineering; and a new facility at UIS that will replace the existing library, including new spaces for teaching and academic support. The House is scheduled to consider the Senate-approved program this weekend.
The state’s investment will help continue the rise of a premier university system that has seen enrollment grow to record highs for six straight years, transforming the lives of more students and building on the pipeline of talent that is critical to Illinois’ future. It will support access and affordability initiatives that include a five-year, in-state tuition freeze, as well as ongoing efforts to recruit and retain world-class faculty, and expand programs and facilities that are cornerstones of our standing as a global leader in education and research discovery.
Our success in this spring’s legislative session is the byproduct of a true team effort and we are grateful to everyone across the system who stepped up to advocate on our behalf. That included more than 3,000 emails during the spring session that shared stories about the impact the U of I System has had in their lives and how it drives the fortunes of our state.
We also are grateful to Gov. Pritzker and the legislature, including our U of I Caucus, for the bipartisan cooperation that fostered this renewed investment in our state’s flagship university system. We are determined to reward their confidence, and help steer Illinois to a new generation of progress and prosperity.

2019-05-09T10:36:00Z,2019-05-09,10:36,28852,Celebrating our values,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28615.html,"Dear colleagues:
This week, the year’s marquee celebrations kick off across the University of Illinois System.
Commencements symbolize the crucial mission we have been entrusted with for more than 150 years – to transform students’ lives and send off new waves of world-class talent year after year to lift the fortunes of our state, our nation and our world.
Our graduates represent the very core of what we do. And as we celebrate them, I hope all of you will also join me in taking a moment to reflect and to reaffirm how we do it.
The U of I System has earned its high global standing through values foreshadowed more than a century ago by our fourth president, Edmund James, who guided a then-fledgling university through an era of growth that helped make us the powerhouse we are today.
“Great things are waiting,” James said of the university in 1904 as his presidency began, “if it only measures up to its opportunities; if it only performs faithfully and simply the duties which the state thrusts upon it.”
His time-proven formula can lift us even higher – to a place as the standard for higher education in this century – if we continue stretching toward our ambitious goals faithfully, simply and with excellence and integrity painted through everything we do.
Integrity defines us. It is our touchstone in classrooms and laboratories, on football or soccer fields, and in our important role as advocates for both higher education and the needs of our state. And our ideals far outstrip the broad dictionary definition of honesty and strong moral character.
We are also forthright, hard-working and transparent. We are grounded, never cut corners and always share credit. We are dedicated, loyal and focused squarely on the public good. We are thoughtful, respectful and determined to make people proud, even when no one is watching. We take the high road. Always the high road.
Those bedrock Midwestern values don’t go unnoticed. Coupled with our rich legacy of excellence, they have added to our worldwide respect and our allure as a go-to destination, helping us set system-wide enrollment records, build on our ranks of world-class faculty and forge new research paradigms to tackle society’s most pressing challenges.
Better yet, the values we model also radiate for decades to come through the lessons that each and every graduate carries with them into the world. We send off over 22,000 every year, adding fresh winds of reason to the air of divisiveness and negativity that often pervades our nation in these turbulent times.
As the Class of 2019 takes the next step in its journey this week, be proud of what they have accomplished and of the solid foundation we have collectively instilled to help them succeed, both in the workplace and in their lives.
My deepest thanks for everything you do – for sharing the talents, the passion and the values that make the University of Illinois System altogether extraordinary.
Sincerely,
Tim"

Thank you to everyone who joined us for the annual Conversation with Senior Leadership at the Illini Union last week. I extend a special thanks to Dean Jeff Brown for moderating a thoughtful and candid discussion about some of the most pressing issues that affect our future.
We filled nearly every seat in Illini Union rooms A, B & C for this event, and we received many questions from the audience. We made an effort to answer as many as we could during our Q&A session, but there were still a few topics that were not covered in the questions we answered.

University contracts with minority-owned businessesIncreasing contracts with local and minority-owned businesses is a priority. Because we are a public university, our contracts are bound by state laws and protocols. We have worked hard to expand opportunities for minority-owned businesses within these guidelines.Last year, we hired LaTonya Webb, Director of Business Community and Economic Development. This individual works on outreach, provides assistance for vendors and works with the Purchasing Office to set supplier diversity goals. She also works with existing diverse suppliers to ensure they are certified through the statewide system, so they are eligible to be selected for projects. We are also part of a Joint Taskforce on Higher Education Supplier Diversity, a statewide effort led by public university presidents. Its goal is to share best practices and identify opportunities for collaboration, in addition to suggesting legislation that would maximize our ability to expand opportunities to minority-owned businesses.
Future plans for expanding digital accessibilityAccessibility is a critically important part of our educational mission and history of innovation. We are continuously looking for opportunities to ensure that structures and delivery formats do not impeded our ability to provide education broadly. One ever-evolving area of accessibility consideration is the digital space.During my first year as chancellor, I charged a committee to develop an Electronic IT Accessibility policy that would make sure that digital resources and digital information are accessible to all students, faculty and staff.Finalized in October 2018 and available in the Campus Administrative Manual, the Electronic IT Accessibility policy promotes high-level coordination of accessibility efforts at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It defines a standard of accessibility compliance and, through a flexible implementation plan, establishes procedures to help ensure that information technology used for the mission of the university is accessible to all persons, regardless of ability or delivery format. View the full policy here.
Plans to expand educational opportunities and access to members of Tribal NationsOver the past few years we have been taking systematic steps to both increase the representation of students, faculty and staff members from Tribal Nations at this university and to ensure that our campus offers welcoming and supportive experiences to these members of our community.Last year’s Critical Conversation on Native Imagery led to the formation of this year’s Commission on Native Imagery: Healing and Reconciliation that is working to bring recommendations to our leadership team for new traditions and new ways to honor and partner with Native Nations. We expect the recommendations of the Commission to be delivered in May.We are continuing to expand our partnership and strengthen our relationship with the Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma. In fact, Chief Craig Harper will be visiting the campus this week to discuss our progress together and our plans for the future. We are working on establishing new relationships with other nations and plans for visits are being scheduled for the summer.We also continue to establish new traditions and activities such as the Land Acknowledgement Statement and the university-wide celebration of Indigenous Peoples Day to honor the cultures of our Native Peoples while opening new educational opportunities to every member of our community."
2019-04-29T15:58:00Z,2019-04-29,15:58,71430,Campus Safety Update,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28628.html,"Dear campus community member:
We would like to provide you with an update regarding the Campus Safety Notice we issued last week, when it was reported that an individual had entered a student’s room at Daniels Hall without permission. The offender in that case has been identified as a 13-year-old individual who does not live in Champaign County. We interviewed him last week in the presence of a parent, and we will be working with the appropriate agencies to address the situation.
Residence hall security is important to us, so please take the time to review the below precautions to keep yourself and others safe.
Do not allow strangers to follow you into your building. It may seem polite to hold the door for someone, but that often allows unauthorized people to enter. It is OK to ask someone to swipe their card to enter a residence hall.
Watch your belongings. Theft is the most common crime on college campuses everywhere, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is no exception. Lock up or secure your personal belongings whenever possible, even if they are sitting right next to you.
Lock your doors. The easiest way to prevent theft and burglary is by locking the door to your vehicle or residence. Criminals often will look for an open door or window to steal your items.
Bring it with you. If you’re leaving campus for an extended period of time, bring your valuables with you. During school breaks, criminals will take advantage of an empty campus.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Please take a moment to review these resources we have made available to keep you informed, and consider liking UIPD on Facebook, following us on Twitter or subscribing to our news feed to receive regular updates.

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This Campus Safety Notice is issued in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about crime on or immediately adjacent to their campuses to aid in the prevention of similar crimes and to assist in the identification of offenders.
This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, please visit CrimeReports.com or visit the University of Illinois Police Department to view the daily crime log.
The following attempted burglary occurred around 6 p.m. Saturday at Daniels Hall, 1010 W. Green St. (map), Urbana: 
It was reported that a U. of I. student was asleep in a residence hall room when awakened by an individual searching through the student’s dresser drawers. The offender abruptly left the room. It did not appear that anything was stolen.
Security cameras captured an image of the suspected offender entering the building by following another person who swiped in. That image can be viewed here: https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/7513/777581.
The University of Illinois Police Department has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area, and we are fortunate to have our force supplemented by the Urbana and Champaign police departments. Between these agencies, the Urbana campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 1,800 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android. All messages to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of identifying information and forwarded to police by an independent third party.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Do not allow strangers to follow you into your building. It may seem polite to hold the door for someone, but that often allows unauthorized people to enter a building they should not be in. It is OK to ask someone to swipe their card to enter a residence hall.
Watch your belongings.Theft is the most common crime on college campuses everywhere, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is no exception. Lock up or secure your personal belongings whenever possible, even if they are sitting right next to you.
Lock your doors. The easiest way to prevent theft and burglary is by locking the door to your vehicle or residence. Criminals often will look for an open door or window to steal your items.
Bring it with you. If you’re leaving campus for an extended period of time, bring your valuables with you. During school breaks, criminals will take advantage of an empty campus.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.

Starting Monday, April 22, all sidewalk and pathway access north of the Main Library along Armory Avenue between 6th St and Wright St will be closed to all pedestrian traffic due to continuing MCORE Project 4 construction.
The site adjustment will remove Americans with Disabilities (ADA) route access to Library Room 66 from along Armory Ave. Accessible entry to the facility will remain available from ramps on the west side of the facility along the Main Quad. Reroutes along Chalmers Street and Gregory Drive are strongly recommended to avoid the work area. A map is available here.
The full project corridor for MCORE Project 4 includes Armory Avenue (between Fourth Street and Wright Street) and Wright Street (between Armory Avenue and Springfield Avenue). Periodic construction updates will be posted on the Facilities & Services website and on the MCORE website.
The work will occur in phases with the majority of construction south of Green Street scheduled this summer. Expected completion for the entire project is December 2020. 
We appreciate your patience and understanding of temporary inconveniences in the area as MCORE improvements make for a more sustainable and connected community.

Dear colleagues:
We are pleased to announce that a program providing additional paid days off during our December/January holidays has been extended to a fourth straight year.
Employees who are eligible for leave benefits will receive three paid gift days for this year’s Reduced Service Days – on December 27, 30 and 31. Before the program began in 2016, employees had been required to draw from their annual pool of paid time off to be paid for the reduced service days.
New this year, employees of the UI Hospital and Clinics will receive the gift days as three additional floating holidays that may be used any time between December 27, 2019, and June 30, 2020, with supervisor approval. This approach will ensure that these units can maintain excellent patient care services during the holiday break and as always, seven days a week.
The program is reflected in the FY 2020 Holiday Schedule that will be distributed to employees. Our universities, hospital and clinics, and system offices will follow up with more details, including how to report the gift days and how they can be used on different days by essential employees who must work on December 27, 30 or 31. As in years past, the gift day program will be evaluated after the holidays to determine whether it will be extended.
For employees in union-represented bargaining units, paid time off for the holidays is addressed through the required collective bargaining process.
Our employees are the foundation of our excellence and our global standing. We hope by continuing this program it demonstrates in concrete terms just how much we appreciate everything you do!

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes on or immediately adjacent to campus property.
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes. We are not including certain details in this alert so as to avoid releasing identifying information about the victim.
The University of Illinois Police Department has received a report that a student was sexually assaulted around 10:20 p.m. Monday, April 8, at Sherman Hall, 909 S. Fifth St., Champaign (map). The offender is a person whom the victim met through a dating app. Images of the suspect were captured on security cameras and can be viewed here: https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/7513/772502.
While we do not typically provide specific information about times and locations of sexual assault incidents to protect the victim’s privacy, we are including that information in this notice because police have not yet made contact with the offender, and it is possible that he is still in the area. At this time, residents in the area of Sherman Hall do not need to take any action but are asked to call 9-1-1 if they see someone matching the description of the offender.
If you have non-emergency information about this incident, you are encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. 
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.
If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another person, intervene if it’s safe to do so or call for assistance.
While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. The university, community organizations and local law enforcement offer a number of reporting options.
Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.
It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.

As many of you know, accreditation is the primary way higher education institutions in the United States are assessed to assure and improve their quality. On March 30-31, 2020, nearly one year from now, we will have our reaccreditation on-site peer review visit. During this time, several evaluators will visit our campus. 
Currently, much work is being done in anticipation of this on-site visit. Over the last year, six groups of faculty and staff have begun to write drafts of our assurance argument responding to the criteria for accreditation. We invited Academic Senate representatives to provide feedback on these early drafts, and we will invite everyone to see a penultimate draft of the report in the fall when we will welcome additional feedback from you. For more information on our process so far, please visit our reaccreditation website.
In the meantime, here are a few things you should know about accreditation:
We are a member of and accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC).
There are five accreditation criteria: Mission; Integrity: Ethical and Responsible Conduct; Teaching and Learning: Quality, Resources, and Support; Teaching and Learning: Evaluation and Improvement; and Resources, Planning, and Institutional Effectiveness.
Title IV federal financial aid funds are limited to students enrolled in an accredited institution. In 2017-2018, this amounted to more than $250 million at Illinois.
An institution’s accreditation status can impact credit transfer from one school to another.
Many graduate and professional schools restrict admission to students who graduated from an accredited institution.
Through accreditation’s processes of self-assessment and external peer review, an institution can ensure that it attains a level of quality and progresses toward meaningful and lasting improvement.
We have a strong history of accreditation and are confident we will be reaccredited, as we have been every year since 1913. But we also want to be sure you are aware of this event and its importance to our university. We hope you will learn about this process and be prepared for our 2020 visit.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

Dear students, faculty, staff and friends:
Today, President Trump signed an executive order regarding freedom of speech on our nation’s college campuses.
The University of Illinois System clearly staked its position in December 2017 when it issued a set of guiding principles on three pressing issues facing campuses across the country, including the ongoing debate over First Amendment rights.
The guiding principles reaffirm the U of I System’s bedrock commitment to free speech in a concise, forthright statement developed through a five-month process that included collaboration among more than 200 key stakeholders across our three universities.
“An unyielding allegiance to freedom of speech – even controversial, contentious, and unpopular speech – is indispensable to developing the analytical and communication skills of our students and empowering all members of our campus communities to be active and informed citizens,” the guiding principles document declares. “We are committed to the open exchange of competing ideas, perspectives, and values – a founding principle that built our nation – and to making the U of I System’s own distinctive institutional voice part of these productive dialogues.”
But academic excellence also requires an environment of mutual respect, and the system will “vigorously and even-handedly protect … against conduct that falls outside the First Amendment” to ensure a safe and robust exchange of viewpoints, the statement says.
We will review the executive order to ensure it is in keeping with our guiding principles, which were created through a thoughtful and inclusive process rooted in the core values that have carried the system to its place as a global leader in education and discovery.
The principles we adopted then and continue to follow now help ensure that each of our universities fosters an inclusive, welcoming campus climate that promotes an open exchange of divergent ideas and develops new generations of leaders.
In addition to free speech on campus, the guiding principles document also addresses the topics of civic engagement, and globalization and immigration. The document and a news release sent when it was announced may be found here.
Thank you for your dedication and loyalty to our three great universities.
Sincerely,
Tim KilleenPresident, University of Illinois System

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. For the University to be in compliance with Federal Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Regulations we are required to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Information about this program can be found here:
http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/
The webpage was prepared in accordance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989. It describes the University’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse, makes clear the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard, and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and provides university and community resources to help with drug or alcohol related problems.
This program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and all new employees in accordance with federal guidelines, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources included within the report.
Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. Civil service employees should contact Staff Human Resources at (217) 333-3101 and academic staff can contact Academic Human Resources at (217) 333-6747.

2019-02-28T17:38:00Z,2019-02-28,17:38,52219,A Message from ISG Regarding Unofficial,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28587.html,"Fellow students, This Unofficial St. Patrick's Day, we want to encourage you to be proactive in looking out for one another.
As Student Body President, I hope you will ensure the safety of yourselves and your peers. In years past, there have been fatal incidents related to activities surrounding this event. These occurrences have led to a larger police presence on campus to safeguard student safety. While this is the case, there are things you can do to help protect yourself and others.
Please follow these preventative steps to avoid fatal incidents this year: 
 Remember to stay hydrated and nourished. Consuming large amounts of alcohol can lead to dehydration, which can be detrimental to your health. Remember to drink plenty of water and eat food regularly to avoid unforeseen risks.
 Know the signs of alcohol poisoning. Alcohol poisoning signs and symptoms include:
Confusion
Vomiting
Seizures
Slow breathing (less than eight breaths a minute)
Irregular breathing (a gap of more than 10 seconds between breaths)
Blue-tinged skin or pale skin
Low body temperature (hypothermia)
Passing out (unconsciousness) and can't be awakened
If you notice someone with these symptoms call 911 immediately as their life may be in danger.
The university maintains Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan policies regarding underage drinking. This means that when a student requires emergency treatment, the university will not pursue disciplinary action against that student for their personal substance use. So, please remember to take care of your fellow students and do not be afraid to seek out medical help if necessary.
 Understand the Social Host Law in Illinois. Party hosts who provide alcohol to underage individuals can potentially be charged up to a Class 4 Felony (which carries penalties of 1 to 3 years in jail and up to a $25,000 fine).
Always remember these simple tips:
If hosting a party do not let strangers in, you may be held liable for them.
Never get into a car with someone who is impaired.
If you have a bad feeling about the situation, your gut feeling is your best bet. Stay alert, be cautious, and do not be afraid to leave.
Finally, please keep these important contacts on hand for this weekend:
Safe Walks: (217) 333-1216 (You can also use an emergency phone to contact a dispatcher. Please give at least 15 minutes notice.)
MTD SafeRides: (217) 265-RIDE (7433)
Rape Crisis Hotline: (217) 384-4444 (Available 24 hours a day)
Domestic Violence Hotline: (217) 384-4390 (Available 24 hours a day)

Remember, whatever you decide to do this Friday, be responsible, be alert, and be respectful of our university community.
In Orange and Blue,
Walter Lindwall, Student Body President
Alice Zheng, Student Body Vice President"

On Friday, March 1, 2019, many students and visitors will participate in an event known as Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. The university does not support or condone this event.
The Champaign, Urbana, and University of Illinois police departments, assisted by other local and state agencies, will patrol the campus district on March 1. They will enforce all applicable ordinances in commercial and residential areas and have authority to intervene if private parties threaten to disturb the peace. In addition, Champaign and Urbana officials will enact retrictions on liquor sales intended to curb overconsumption. Emergency medical personnel will be available to provide care.
University police will continue to focus on protecting students, staff, faculty, and university property. If asking a disruptive student to leave class could escalate into a confrontation, you may seek assistance from these officers. Should you need to report an incident, call METCAD at 911 for emergencies, 333-8911 for non-emergencies.
As in years past, we have made clear to students that academic business will continue as usual on Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. Instructors are encouraged not to cancel classes.
The Student Code http://studentcode.illinois.edu/ addresses student responsibilities on campus. Sections 1-102(d) concerns classroom conduct expectations, section 1-305 is the policy on drugs, and section 1-307 focuses on alcohol consumption. The Code empowers instructors to ask disruptive students to leave class; after class, names of disruptive students should be reported to the Office of Student Conflict Resolution at 217-333-3680.
Students will be asked not to bring any liquids into Foellinger Auditorium and Lincoln Hall Theatre. Longstanding policy prohibits liquids and food in these spaces.
Students who interfere with the academic mission of the university will face serious consequences. Thank you for reinforcing this message before and on March 1.

2019-02-20T16:26:00Z,2019-02-20,16:26,18007,Awareness of Foreign Influence on Illinois Research and...,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28584.html,"You may have heard recent news reports about research integrity and inappropriate foreign influence on university research. We are writing to you to make sure you know that these concerns are legitimate, non-partisan, and growing, and we want to remind you of your responsibilities to
safeguard university resources and intellectual property;
fully disclose external financial interests, affiliations, and activities; and
follow export regulations.
The topic of foreign influence on federally sponsored research, including confidential peer review, has recently garnered significant attention across multiple government agencies—especially at the Department of Defense (see National Defense Authorization Act), but also at other agencies like the National Institutes of Health (see Letter from NIH Director Francis Collins)
The phrase “foreign influence” in this context is a technical term relating to economic and political espionage and the protection of the intellectual property and scholarship of U.S. researchers from exploitation by “foreign governments and external entities.”  The designation of “foreign influence” is neither a catchall phrase to describe U.S. researchers who are not native to this country nor an attempt to circumscribe international scholarship or limit collegial relationships with international colleagues.  
While the University of Illinois remains dedicated to cultivating research collaborations with foreign sponsors, we as a research community must be transparent about our external relationships, maintain the integrity of our research enterprise, and protect our intellectual property and university resources. The regulations in place and the guidance provided do not impinge on our land-grant educational mission. There is no conflict between monitoring external affiliations and access to university resources and intellectual property and our commitment to the principles of freedom of inquiry and scholarly collaboration. We are mindful of our responsibilities as a public research university—security is critical to our preservation and academic freedom is the currency of our success. Please consider the following questions to ensure that your international relationships and interests are managed with these goals in mind.  Are you aware of the university’s export control policies?When traveling on university business, remain cognizant of whether or not your travel, research, or foreign engagement may be subject to U.S. export regulations. If so, be sure to review institutional resources on managing export compliance here, or contact the Export Compliance Officer at exportcontrols@illinois.edu. On a related note, be aware that using some social media applications in certain countries may be monitored by law enforcement officials.
Have you promptly disclosed inventions to the Office of Technology Management (OTM)?Ensure that any transfer of intellectual property, proprietary data, materials, or technical information to foreign entities is covered by an appropriate agreement negotiated by the Office of Technology Management.Have you fully disclosed your non-university activities?Always obtain pre-approval from your department head, chair, or dean for all non-university income-producing activities. This includes outside professional activities as well as relationships and foreign talent recruitment programs. To report these activities and affiliations, update your Report of Non-University Activities in START myDisclosures.Have you completed or updated any required sponsor-specific disclosure form?Some sponsors like the Public Health Service (PHS) require investigators to disclose significant financial interests and non-Illinois sponsored travel that could reasonably be related to your institutional responsibilities. This includes financial interests with foreign entities, including foreign institutions of higher education or the government of another country.Have you met all agency disclosure requirements, including current and pending research support, in all applications for sponsored funding?This includes all foreign or domestic grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and institutional awards. You should also note any planned collaborations, (foreign or domestic), and the scope of the collaboration, including the exchange of information, materials, or data.
Have you shared your affiliations with outside organizations?If you are required, be sure to disclose your activities, affiliations, and relationships when speaking, teaching, or publishing with outside organizations like scientific journals and professional societies.
For more information on disclosure of external activities, or if you need to disclose activities from a previous year, please contact coi@illinois.edu.Resources

2019-02-06T09:50:00Z,2019-02-06,9:50,70997,Campus Parking Rate Changes,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28565.html,"Dear members of the campus community,
We want to inform you of an increase to University of Illinois parking rates for Fiscal Year 2020 (FY20), which begins July 1, 2019. This will be the first annual permit rate increase since 2012. This increase is necessary to keep pace with maintenance and construction costs associated with upkeep and improvement to parking infrastructure. Unfortunately, these expenses cannot be deferred by external funding. The Parking Department is exclusively self-funded, managing five parking structures and over 150 parking lots on campus. These necessary rate increases have been endorsed by the Parking Advisory Committee and approved by the chancellor.
We are sending you this message in advance of rate changes so you can make an informed decision on your parking needs, as well as provide departments the opportunity for budget planning.
Following are the changes you will see beginning FY20:
Faculty and Staff Virtual Parking Permits will increase from 0.8% to 0.9% of an individual’s annual base salary. Here are specific examples of how salary levels will be effected by the new rate structure:
SALARY                0.8%/year           0.9%/year           0.8%/month          0.9%/month
$30,000/year        $240                    $270                      $20.00                     $22.50
$50,000/year         $400                    $450                      $33.33                     $37.50
$70,000/year        $560                    $630                      $46.67                     $52.50
The salary-based permit rate will be capped at $745 annually. Individuals earning $82,777.77 a year and above will pay this capped rate, which represents a monthly increase of $9.58.
For employees in union-represented bargaining units, the rate changes will be implemented through the required collective bargaining process.

The Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) has informed us that a second case of measles has been confirmed among members of the campus community. CUPHD has asked us to share the update below that includes important information about healthcare precautions and recommendations for all of our faculty, staff and students.  
The university is working closely with CUPHD and McKinley Health Center to identify any at-risk individuals and will be notifying these individuals as necessary. 
Most individuals are vaccinated routinely in childhood (MMR, Measles, Mumps, Rubella vaccine) and are not at high risk. Of greatest concern are people who have not been vaccinated, including infants. If you think you have measles, you should call your health care provider for guidance. Students should contact the Mckinley Health Center at 333-2700. 
Thank you for your attention and efforts to help protect all members of our community.

February 2, 2019 Champaign-Urbana Public Health Message
Second Measles CaseThe Champaign-Urbana Public Health District says call a health care provider if you are having symptoms
Champaign, IL – The Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) is reporting a second local case of measles. Most individuals are vaccinated routinely, in childhood, starting at age 1 (MMR, Measles, Mumps, Rubella vaccine) and are not at high risk for infection. Of most concern are people who have not been vaccinated, including infants. Individuals unsure of their vaccine records should call their health care provider to check to see if they are fully vaccinated. Individuals with symptoms should CALL their health care provider to discuss the need for testing before presenting to the clinic. University of Illinois students who have symptoms should contact McKinley Health Center before presenting for care.
The person who was identified, who was infectious at the time, was at the locations listed below. Two hours have been added to the time after the individual left the following locations.
POSSIBLE EXPOSURE LOCATION
January 18, 2019 2:00 – 5:30 PM McKinley Health Center at the University of Illinois
January 28, 2019
9:30 AM – 4:15 PM University of Illinois School of Social Work

Symptoms of measles include rash, high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. If individuals develop symptoms of measles, CUPHD recommends they stay home and call their healthcare provider. Special arrangements can be made for evaluation while also protecting other patients and medical staff from possible infection. Measles can cause serious complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis (swelling of the brain). Measles is easily spread through the air when someone coughs or sneezes. People can also get sick when they come in contact with mucus or saliva from an infected person. “If you feel you may have measles, it is extremely important that you call your healthcare provider first, rather than showing up to a healthcare facility where additional exposures could occur,” said CUPHD Administrator, Julie Pryde. “If you or your children are not currently vaccinated against measles, it is advised that you do so now. One dose offers up to 93 percent protection. Two doses offer 97 percent protection. Both cases in this situation were non-immune persons but the overall Champaign-Urbana community is highly immunized.” For more information about measles, contact your health care provider.

I am pleased to announce the inaugural faculty recipients under a new funding initiative aimed at celebrating the impact and importance of the arts and humanities across the University of Illinois System.
Fourteen faculty projects were selected from nearly 60 extraordinary proposals from our three universities and will share nearly $2 million in funding over the next two years. The faculty and their forward-thinking projects are outlined in the news release below that will go to media today.
I’m sure you share my belief that the arts and the humanities are central to education, research, scholarship and public engagement no matter the discipline. We want to send the message here at home and beyond that the U of I System deeply values the arts and humanities, and the power they hold to serve both students and the public good.
Please join me in congratulating the faculty recipients.

U of I System invests nearly $2 million in arts and humanities Two-year program supports faculty initiatives, reflects system's commitment
Pop-up galleries, an Illinois writer’s festival, theater renovations and using virtual reality to teach performance are among the projects funded in a new, nearly $2 million initiative by the University of Illinois System aimed at emphasizing the impact and influence of the arts and humanities across Illinois.
Fourteen projects were selected from more than 50 proposals in the first year of the Presidential Initiative to Celebrate the Impact of the Arts and the Humanities, launched last summer by President Tim Killeen to enhance and celebrate the arts and humanities at the system’s universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield.
“The arts and the humanities are essential to providing a well-rounded education, crucial to fostering conscientious citizenship in communities, and foundational for the creative contributions that are needed within every economic sector,” Killeen said. “This initiative sends a message around the state and the country that the arts and humanities are a priority here.”
The original plan was to provide up to $1 million each year over the next two years to support faculty projects. But Killeen said so many strong proposals were received, including many multi-year and multi-university collaborative initiatives, that initial funding was increased to cover more projects over a two-year period. The program will be revisited in 2020.
Resources and attention are often placed on science because it fosters innovation with tangible returns, such as new products and business, yet the U of I System values the arts and the humanities just as much, Killeen said.
“Although science and technology are rightly celebrated for their driving roles in our knowledge-based economy, we hold the arts and the humanities in equal reverence,” Killeen said. “This initiative will leverage the collective scholarship and creativity of the U of I System in these fields to serve as a catalyst for initiatives that will serve the public good.”
Of the 14 proposals, all but one was allocated $100,000 or more and eight will receive $150,000 or more. By comparison, the average grant award in 2016 by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) was $25,000 and fewer than 40 NEA grants totaled more than $100,000, according to Grantmakers in the Arts.
The program is supported by the offices of both the President and the Executive Vice President, using funds devoted to faculty development. Projects and funding amounts include:
The Mythic Mississippi: I-Heritage as Public Engagement and Economic and Social Development, $180,000Helaine Silverman (Urbana-Champaign), Devin Hunter (Springfield)This public engagement project will help a selection of downstate Illinois communities to identify points of cultural heritage as a means of creating themed tourism routes along and near the Mississippi River. Faculty and students from the two campuses will conduct research collaboratively with local governmental, business and educational partners aimed at achieving sustainable strategies and effective policies that will foster local economic and social development. A website and high school-level teaching modules also will be produced. The project will culminate with a national symposium on the use of heritage tourism for community development.
The Humanities Innovating New Knowledge (THINK), $150,000Barbara Ransby and Jennifer Brier (Chicago), Kathryn Oberdeck (Urbana-Champaign), Devin Hunter (Springfield)THINK will bring together more than 30 faculty from across the U of I System’s three universities as well as community leaders to create an infrastructure for producing arts- and humanities-based exhibits and events in Chicago, Urbana-Champaign and Springfield. The project will include educational opportunities for students, pop-up installations that engage historical and contemporary issues in these respective communities, and scholar-practitioner working groups to address social problems, such as violence, wealth disparity, incarceration and human rights.
The Hip-Hop Xpress, $150,000Adam Kruse, Malaika McKee, William Patterson, (Urbana-Champaign), Tiffani Saunders (Springfield)The Hip-Hop Xpress is a project involving the creation of an internet-enabled school bus to be equipped as a multi-user music production and recording studio. Using music, dance, visual arts and technology, the bus will travel to communities and classrooms across the state, teaching youth about African-American history as well as cultural innovations spurred on by Hip-Hop. The mobile classroom will work with U of I Extension offices to reach youth organizations across Illinois. The project’s goals are to further integrate the arts into people’s lives and help develop Hip-Hop studies on all three campuses.
Transforming Storytelling: Multi-User Virtual Reality Theater for Collaborative Tele-Immersive Exploration, $150,000Daria Tsoupikova (Chicago)This project involves a substantial collaboration between the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) School of Design, the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory and Chicago’s Tony Award-winning Goodman Theatre. Multi-user theatrical performances will be developed by UIC Design and Computer Science faculty, staff and students to encourage stronger engagement in live story-telling with tech-savvy younger audiences. Hundreds of Chicago youth from underserved communities will attend these performances at the Goodman Theatre and at the CAVE2 on the UIC campus, allowing for immersive participation in the plotlines through avatars, hand-held devices and 3D platforms. The project is designed to demonstrate how virtual reality technology can be used to enhance the immersed experience of participants in live theater performances.
A Year of Creative Writers at Illinois, 2020, $150,000Antoinette Burton (Urbana-Champaign)Creative writers are noteworthy chroniclers of social and cultural moments, often shedding light on the human condition. This proposal will foster conversations with award-winning creative writers by bringing them to audiences across the U of I System. Writers at all stages of their careers will highlight a range of genres and share their reflections on the creative-writing process in classrooms, community readings and book signings. The year-long celebration will culminate in a “Festival of Writers” event in Urbana-Champaign in November 2020 with a series of events featuring authors from big names to emerging voices.
Studio Theatre Renovations, $150,000Eric Thibodeaux-Thompson, Bryan Rives (Springfield)This project will support major structural improvements to the University of Illinois at Springfield (UIS) Studio Theater. Located in the Public Affairs Center Building on the UIS campus, the theater is a variable-use performance space able to seat about 200 people. Renovations and technology upgrades – including new seating, a new curtain system, lighting and sound – will provide a modern and professional performance venue for UIS Theatre and Music faculty and students. The intimate venue also will support smaller regional and national touring performances, opening the campus to wider community involvement.
The Innovation Illinois Community Laboratory + Interactive Exhibit, $150,000 Anita Chan, Benjamin Grosser, Karrie Karahalios, Karen Rodriguez’G (Urbana-Champaign)This project will highlight the rich contributions of arts, humanities and civic partnerships in famed innovations from Urbana-Champaign, such as the first wheelchair bus system, the first music composition created by a computer and first graphical web browser. The project leaders will develop a year-long course for freshmen that delves into case studies of innovations that brought artists and humanists into collaboration with scientists and engineers. The course will teach design thinking as well as skills in multidisciplinary methods and will culminate in student projects that model such processes. A traveling exhibit that highlights the best projects will be hosted at key sites, showcasing innovation prototypes for the public, including alumni.
Global Film History from the Edges: Engineering a Comparative Public Humanities, $150,000Rini B. Mehta (Urbana-Champaign)This project will create an online archive and research platform for the study of cinema on a global scale. Project leaders will work with faculty and students from all three universities to create three modules: one that explores how films have influenced and are influenced by the world’s greatest cities; one that explores the production of films on a world-wide scale in terms of power and the flow of capital; and one that explores the role of gender and the star-effect in films across the world. The resulting massive data base will be conjoined with critical and analytical tools in a user-friendly interface. Scholars, students and the public will be able to use the publicly available platform to explore film history from regional, linguistic and comparative perspectives.
Collaborative Reinstallation of the Ancient Andean collections at Krannert Art Museum, $145,000Allyson Purpura, Jon Seydl, Kasia Szremski (Urbana-Champaign), Brian Bauer (Chicago)This project spearheaded by a system-wide team of scholars will update how the approximately 600-piece collection of ancient and colonial Andean art is presented at the Krannert Art Museum in Champaign. The internationally acclaimed collection, acquired by the museum in 1967, includes some exceedingly rare objects such as a fully intact khipu, a device made of knotted cords used by the Inka for record-keeping and sending messages. Informed by the latest interdisciplinary research, the project will develop new interpretative frameworks for the exhibition, including storylines that will explore notions of identity and power, labor, agricultural practices and the politics of indigeneity. The project also will foster community outreach, and an interactive, digital platform that will connect local and global users to the collection and to each other.
Young People Science Theater: CPS and UIC Students Creating Performances for Social Change, $145,000Maria Varelas, Rachelle Tsachor, Nathan Phillips, Rebecca Woodard, Rebecca Kotler, Hannah Natividad (Chicago)This project will enhance and expand STAGE (Science Theater for Advancing Generative Engagement), an existing partnership between UIC and Chicago neighborhood elementary and middle schools that cultivates young people’s science knowledge through theatrical and embodied ways of learning. In their classrooms, students will explore science topics such as greenhouse gases intertwined with social issues and share their thinking through creative performance. Supported by Chicago Public School (CPS) teachers, and UIC students and faculty in science and in theatre, young people’s performances will showcase their understanding of and passion for science and its relation to the social world, positioning them as leaders of social change.
Digital Humanities Initiative, $145,000Mark Canuel, Mary Case (Chicago)New and emerging digital technologies have been changing the nature of scholarship in the humanities for the past few years. The Digital Humanities project will provide technical support to allow UIC faculty to develop new methods and technologies in their current research, to create new paradigms in future scholarship, and to increase graduate students’ exposure to digital techniques to enhance competitiveness in the job market. Funding will support workshops for faculty and students, a postdoctoral fellowship and software enhancements for research. The initiative will be hosted by UIC’s Institute for the Humanities and the Library. Expanding dissemination of humanities research across digital platforms also will enhance its impact by reaching larger audiences on a regional, national and global level.
The Bilingual Advantage Starts at Home, $140,000Melissa A. Bowles (Urbana-Champaign) and Kim Potowski (Chicago)With nearly one in four Illinois families with school-age children speaking languages other than English in the home, the Bilingual Advantage Starts at Home project aims to raise awareness of the lifelong benefits associated with being bilingual. Undergraduate and graduate students in Urbana-Champaign and Chicago will design educational materials and brochures for students, teachers, school administrators and parents across Illinois, and also will provide direct outreach. The project will reach an estimated 2,600 primary school teachers over two years, and will target both urban and rural areas across Illinois with the highest concentration and the fastest growth of children who speak languages other than English.
The Art of Medicine, $100,000Stephanie Hilger and Justine Murison (Urbana-Champaign)This interdisciplinary project is a collaboration among faculty at all three U of I System universities with the goal of bridging the humanities and health sciences for students seeking careers in health. One aspect will be dedicated to the building of a medical humanities curriculum for both undergraduates and medical students in the new Carle Illinois College of Medicine. Another involves creating “public squares” that will bring together scholars, students, community experts, activists, artists and health professionals to discuss various health issues impacting the communities surrounding the three universities.
Hearing the Ocean, Seeing the Rain: Water, the Arts, and the Future of Human Life on Earth, $50,000Michael Silvers (Urbana-Champaign)This multi-year initiative will celebrate and explore the role of the arts in understanding water in human life across the globe. Visual and performing artists, as well as scholars, will work to reshape dialogue about our planet’s scarce resource, taking into account the role of creative expression in developing sustainable solutions to this problem. Programming will reach students through the development of two interdisciplinary courses on water as understood through the cultural lens of architecture, music, history and dance. The project will reach the general public through concert performances and interactive artistic activities across the state. Funding also will support multi-disciplinary student research on water, and an edited volume and radio documentary series.

Measles is a highly contagious disease to persons who are unvaccinated and exposed. The MMR vaccine (Measles/Mumps/Rubella) provides protection against measles in most situations. The MMR is a routine immunization in many countries and is a requirement at the University of Illinois. 
Measles is spread to others through the air after someone coughs or sneezes. Measles symptoms include: fever, cough, runny nose, red-watery eyes, and a rash.
https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/signs-symptoms.html
Public Health considers a person protected (immune) from measles if they have had one of the following:
Two doses of measles containing vaccine (MMR or measles).
A laboratory confirmed positive measles antibody result.
Born before 1957.
McKinley Health Center is working with Public Health to identify at-risk individuals and will be notifying these individuals as identified. 
If you are a student and unsure if you meet the above immunity standards, you may:
View your immunization history on the MyMcKinley Student Health Portal. 
Call McKinley Health Center at (217) 333-2700 to review your vaccination history.
If you are not a student and are unsure if you meet the above immunity standards, contact your health care provider.
For everyone in our campus community, if you think you have symptoms of measles, stay home, stay away from others and contact McKinley Health Center at (217) 333-2700 immediately.

Snow and ice removal in areas vital to the operation and safety of campus users is the top priority. Clearing activities for a winter weather event of this duration and intensity display the commitment and persistence of the more than 125 building service workers, drivers, grounds workers, operating engineers, garage staff, and support personnel performing shifts over the weekend to keep the campus open and accessible for students, faculty, and staff. Many of these same individuals who successfully cleared the campus after the significant accumulation returned early this morning to address remaining touch-up items and will continue to do so throughout the week as thawing and re-freezing conditions persist.
More information about campus snow/ice removal is available at http://www.fs.illinois.edu/services/maintenance/snow-removal. If you have questions or feedback about snow and ice removal operations, or to report areas for treatment, contact the F&S Service Office fsserviceoffice@illinois.edu, 333-0340.

Dear Students,
As you might have heard, the National Weather Service (NWS) has issued a Winter Storm Warning for much of Illinois beginning tonight and well into the weekend. As many of you likely plan to travel to campus during that time, we remind you that NWS says a Winter Storm Warning for snow means severe winter weather conditions will make travel very hazardous or impossible. If you can’t return to campus by this evening, we strongly encourage you to wait until Sunday to travel.
Your safety is our number one priority, and if you do not feel you can safely return to campus in time for classes Monday please alert the Office of the Dean of Students at helpdean@illinois.edu.
I hope your holiday was relaxing and fun, and I look forward to seeing you back on campus – but not until you can get here safely.

2018-12-04T19:20:00Z,2018-12-04,19:20,68866,Campus Safety Notice,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28542.html,"Dear campus community member:
We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes on or immediately adjacent to campus property.
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes. To protect victims’ privacy, we generally do not include specific details about exact locations or times to avoid releasing information that could lead to the identification of a survivor and cause further harm to that person.
On Tuesday afternoon, a Campus Security Authority reported that a U. of I. student had been touched inappropriately around 4 p.m. Sunday at a fraternity house by a person with whom the student was acquainted. 
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to assist those involved in this incident and will continue to take actions to maintain the safety and security of the campus community.
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.
If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another person, intervene if it’s safe to do so or call for assistance.
While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. The university, community organizations and local law enforcement offer a number of reporting options.
Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.
It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.

As the end of the year approaches, we wanted to share some of the remarkable progress we have made toward the Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) and Illinois Innovation Network (IIN) since the discussion forums at each of our universities earlier this fall.
We have formed the academic working groups that are helping develop DPI’s initial plans and priorities, and the 125 members from across the system who are sharing their talents have been added to our DPI website. We have begun DPI operations in our 20,000-square-foot facility at 200 South Wacker Drive in Chicago, where we are able to host research, education and outreach projects, events, courses, and meetings. We have officially applied for the $500 million in state capital funding that the legislature approved last spring to develop DPI and IIN, which includes the projects at our universities that we outlined at the discussion forums in August. And we have greatly improved our website, transitioning it from a concept site to one that reflects a living, active institute.
We have announced an IIN hub at Northern Illinois University, the first outside of the U of I System’s three universities. We also have had very positive conversations with every four-year public university in the state about becoming an IIN hub, and expect additional hub announcements.
As we continue our work, we hope many more of you will become involved. We invite you to join experts groups organized around DPI’s themes and cross-cutting areas, and to submit proposals for DPI research, education, and engagement activities. The experts groups will provide feedback to guide development of each theme and cross-cutting area. The proposals will produce the first wave of educational, research, and outreach activities at DPI and are eligible for up to $15,000 of seed funding per project.
The proposals will be reviewed on a rolling basis beginning on Dec. 14. The expertise of our faculty and staff is a cornerstone of DPI and IIN, and we look forward to your creative proposals and your input through the experts groups.
Thank you for all you do for the U of I System.

Dear colleagues:
I am pleased to announce our newest Presidential Fellows – Professors Prasanta Kalita and Andy Singer of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Professor Jeffrey Loeb of the University of Illinois at Chicago.
All are highly respected scholars who will share their talents on a part-time basis over the next year to help build on our progress in developing the Discovery Partners Institute (DPI). DPI is the cornerstone of a statewide network led by the U of I System to accelerate the breakthrough research discovery and entrepreneurship that drives innovation, job creation and economic growth.
Professor Kalita joined the Urbana-Champaign faculty in 1999 as a professor of agricultural and biological engineering. He is a nationally regarded expert in environmental sustainability, food security, water resources management and water quality. As a Presidential Fellow, Dr. Kalita will work with DPI to capitalize on the world-class problem-solving strengths of the U of I System and its partner institutions to develop short- and long-term strategies to reduce food insecurity.
Professor Singer, who joined the Urbana-Champaign faculty in 1998, is the Fox Family Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the College of Engineering, where he also serves as associate dean for innovation and entrepreneurship. He is a standard-bearer of entrepreneurship and a renowned expert in signals processing for wireless, optical and underwater communications. In his role as a Presidential Fellow, he will work with faculty to increase the participation of women and underrepresented groups at DPI and in other entrepreneurship ecosystems across our universities and the state.
Professor Loeb joined UIC in 2013 and is the John S. Garvin Endowed Chair in Neurology, head of the Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation and founder of University of Illinois NeuroRepository in the College of Medicine. An active clinician, he specializes in the evaluation and treatment of epilepsy, and is an expert in quantitative measurements of epileptic electrical activity in the brain to manage patients with hard-to-control seizures. As a Presidential Fellow, Dr. Loeb will work with a healthcare data information platform developed by UIC and industry partners that will enhance discovery by enabling analysis of multiple types of patient information through a single format.
I am grateful to our outgoing Presidential Fellows – Professors Antoinette Burton and Don Wuebbles of Urbana-Champaign and Lisa Lee of UIC – for their service and important contributions to the system. And I hope you will join me in welcoming Professors Kalita, Singer and Loeb as they launch new initiatives that will continue our push toward the high-aspiration goals of our Strategic Framework, a roadmap that will build on our more than 150 years of service to students and the public good.
Sincerely,

I want to thank the Academic Senate for hosting the Oct. 29, 2018, Annual Meeting of the Faculty. President Killeen and I both appreciated the opportunity to share some of our perspectives on current events and offer some thoughts on opportunities for greater collaboration through our shared governance.
For those of you who were not able to attend, the presentations were recorded.  You can find the full text of my remarks and a link to the archived video here.
In something of a departure from previous years, I used this forum as an opportunity to open discussion with the Academic Senate around ways we might work more effectively in the intersection of shared priorities and shared governance. I also laid out a proposed legislative agenda that might serve as a starting point for these conversations together.
I hope you’ll consider taking some time to either view the video or to read the remarks. Your thoughts and feedback to me or to the leadership of the Academic Senate would be welcomed.
As I said in this speech, when we look at our best decisions at this university, those that stand out are the ones where we didn’t just talk about shared governance, but where we demonstrated exactly what it can - and should - look like for a world-class public university.

Last month, we informed you that this year’s Annual Security and Fire Safety Report had been made available. We would like to inform you that we have since made revisions to that report. It remains available online at http://police.illinois.edu/clery.
Following the original publication of the report, the Office for Access and Equity changed a procedure regarding the adjudication of violations for employee discrimination and harassment violations (page 93 of the report). Previously, any appeals made through this process were heard by a senior associate chancellor. Appeals are now being heard by a three-person appeals panel. The report has been updated to include this information, and federal law requires us to notify you of this revision.
This change was made effective Oct. 1 as part of an ongoing review of our campus’ procedures to adjudicate complaints of discrimination and harassment. It is anticipated that more changes will be made to those processes in the months to come, and you will be notified each time a revision is made to the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report.
In addition to the revised information, the report includes statistics from the previous three years concerning reported crime that occurred on campus, in certain off-campus buildings or on property owned or controlled by the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The report also includes statistics for fires in on-campus student housing and institutional policies concerning campus security and other safety information.
A hard copy of the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report may be obtained by visiting the U. of I. Public Safety Building at 1110 W. Springfield Ave., Urbana, IL 61801, or contacting 217-333-1216.
In addition to reviewing this report, there are other important steps you can take to enhance your own safety on campus.
Review sexual violence and misconduct resources available to the campus community at wecare.illinois.edu.
Sign up for Illini-Alert text messages by visiting emergency.illinois.edu.
Review campus safety measures at police.illinois.edu/safety.
Take a minute to prepare for emergencies at police.illinois.edu/safe.
We hope you continue to find this report a helpful and informative resource to promote your own awareness of public safety issues on our campus.
Sincerely,
Craig A. StoneExecutive Director of Public Safety and Chief of Police"

As chancellor, it is my responsibility to annually reaffirm our campus commitment to equal opportunity, affirmative action, and equal access. The campus is committed to creating and maintaining a community that recognizes and values the inherent worth and dignity of every person, while fostering an environment of mutual respect among its members.
Diversity within the University of Illinois advances the academic purposes of the University, and an affirmative action policy is essential to achieving such diversity. As a part of our affirmative action plan, consistent with state and federal laws, we undertake good faith efforts to increase the representation of women, minorities, persons with disabilities, and veterans.
University policies prohibit discrimination and harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, disability, national origin, citizenship status, ancestry, age, order of protection status, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation including gender identity, arrest record status, unfavorable discharge from the military or status as a protected veteran. These protections extend to all members of the campus community during any stage of the employment process including recruitment, selection, promotion, transfer, merit increases, salary, training and development, demotion, and separation. Similarly, the University prohibits discrimination in admissions, enrollment, and in the provision of all services, programs and activities.
Please contact the Office for Access and Equity, accessandequity@illinois.edu if you have questions about our University policies and for assistance with discrimination, harassment, affirmative action, and disability related matters. The University’s policy, procedures, and protocols are available online at http://cam.illinois.edu/ix/ix-b/ix-b-6.htm.
While Illinois and higher education institutions around the country continue to await further guidance on Title IX and sexual misconduct from the U.S. Department of Education, we want to assure the campus community that State of Illinois law, Preventing Sexual Violence in Higher Education, remains in effect. In recognition of the continued importance in taking action to eliminate sexual misconduct, Illinois has implemented a requirement that all new students will complete online sexual misconduct training, in addition to the expectation that all students complete the training annually.
We wish to emphasize our promise to continue to provide optimal services, support, resources and guidance to address sexual misconduct in our community and to those who need assistance. Our responsibility to ensure safety to our students, staff and faculty will not change.
We remain vigilant in our response to sexual misconduct, affirming due process, fairness, and dignity. We will be steadfast in our response and treat all matters with urgency while working towards providing survivors with respect and support with the many available campus resources.
Danielle Morrison, our Title IX and Disability Coordinator, oversees and supports the University’s comprehensive programs and activities that ensure compliance with University policies and state and federal laws related to sexual discrimination and misconduct. You can email her at titleixcoordinator@illinois.edu or call (844) 616-7978. Please visit the We Care website (wecare.illinois.edu), to learn more about confidential and non-confidential resources, University policies, disciplinary procedures, rights and options, and additional information related to the prevention, reporting and response to sexual misconduct. Questions regarding Title IX may also be sent to the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (http://wecare.illinois.edu/help/report/#external). 
As of October 1, 2018, you will find the Title IX & Disability Office as well as the Office for Access and Equity in their new location at 616 E. Green Street, suite 214, Champaign, IL. 
Realizing our shared vision of an inclusive campus requires that we all annually reaffirm our individual commitment to building a truly diverse, welcoming, and inclusive community of students, scholars and staff. Please join me in affirming your individual commitment to creating and maintaining an inclusive campus community. 
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes on or immediately adjacent to campus property.
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes. We are not including certain details in this alert so as to avoid releasing identifying information about the victim.
On Thursday morning, the University of Illinois Police Department received a report that a student was sexually assaulted at 1:20 a.m. Wednesday in the 1200 block of West Nevada Street (map), in Urbana. It was reported that the student was using the Uber rideshare service to travel from the 200 block of East Green Street, Champaign, to Urbana when the driver pulled over in a parking lot and sexually assaulted the student. The driver has since been removed from the rideshare service. Police have the driver’s information and are actively investigating.
The offender was described as a black male in his 20s with a short, full beard and driving a gray Ford Focus with license plate BA6 2741.
Information about the race or ethnicity of alleged offenders is provided only to aid detailed descriptions that include physical stature, clothing or unusual characteristics. Racial descriptions do not, by themselves, offer a meaningful picture of an individual’s appearance.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android. All messages to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of identifying information and forwarded to police by an independent third party.
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.
If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another person, intervene if it’s safe to do so or call for assistance.
While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. The university, community organizations and local law enforcement offer a number of reporting options.
Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.
It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.

Democracy relies on each of you to participate in helping to shape our Illini community and your communities at home. Voting is one way that each of you can participate in civic engagement and it is part of our collective responsibility as citizens of the United States of America.
Early voting has begun in the State of Illinois, and we encourage you take advantage of this opportunity, or submit your application for an absentee ballot if you are not registered to vote in Champaign County. Any qualified voter may cast a ballot prior to Election Day, Tuesday, November 6. Early voting in Champaign County can be done at the County’s Clerk Office located at 1776 E. Washington St., Urbana, IL 61802. Get more information about early voting. 
The University of Illinois, Illini Union, Room 404 will be an early voting site beginning October 25.
For those who are registered to vote outside of Champaign County, we encourage you to vote via absentee ballot. If you are a resident of Illinois, your request for a ballot must be received by November 1, 2018 by the “election authority for the jurisdiction in which you are registered.” Learn how to obtain an absentee ballot.  If you are not a resident of Illinois, you should review information about voting by mail for your state.
In the event that you need to register to vote, or change your address to vote in Champaign County for the upcoming election, you still have time. You have the option of online voter registration for the State of Illinois. As every state has their own guidelines for voter registration, you should review your home state requirements if you are an out-of-state student.
Regardless of where or when you vote, we hope you will participate in the Big Ten Voting Challenge events sponsored by the Illinois Student Government. Some of the events include:
October 18: Rodney Davis and Betsy Dirksen Londrigan Debate Campus Wide Watch Parties. Visit the Illinois Student Government web site for further details.

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This Campus Safety Notice is issued in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about crime to aid in the prevention of similar crimes and to assist in the identification of offenders.
This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, please visit CrimeReports.com or visit the University of Illinois Police Department to view the daily crime log.
The following battery took place at 12:37 a.m. Sunday just outside of parking garage B-4, 1201 W. University Ave. (map), in Urbana:
Two men were walking on the sidewalk along Goodwin Avenue when they were approached and punched from behind by another group of three to five men. One of the victims was knocked down, and the offenders continued to hit him while on the ground. The attack may have been related to a verbal altercation which had just occurred on a private bus. One of the victims had facial injuries but was not taken to the hospital. Neither of the victims are U. of I. students. Witnesses were unable to provide a complete description of the offenders.
The University of Illinois Police Department has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area, and we are fortunate to have our force supplemented by the Urbana and Champaign police departments. Between these agencies, the Urbana campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 1,800 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android. All messages to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of identifying information and forwarded to police by an independent third party.
This is our community. Let's stay together.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks escort if you need one.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 9-1-1 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.
If you choose to consume alcohol, please be responsible. Remember your ability to respond is diminished by overconsumption of alcohol.

Please be aware that there are a number of simultaneous sophisticated phishing attacks targeting email accounts across the University. They come in the form of emails designed to appear as legitimate campus communications.
Recent phishing attacks of this type have included spoofs of emails such as ILLINI ALERTS or messages about Two-Factor Authentication. Any time a broadly disseminated legitimate message such as 2FA is sent, attackers often mimic them as well.
In addition to the tools that Technology Services Privacy and Security uses to mitigate and monitor for phishing campaigns, you are a key part of preventing account and computer compromises. There is much you as an individual can and should do to protect your account and thus your personal and University data.
Be vigilant.
Many attacks mimic legitimate, relevant campus communications. The University of Illinois will never ask you to reply to an email with your password or to update account information through email.
Know before you click.
Check the hyperlink targets and attachments in email before clicking. Legitimate Illinois website addresses begin with illinois.edu or uillinois.edu. Only enter your NetID and password into pages with legitimate Illinois addresses.
Any website that is asking for sensitive information should begin with HTTPS.
Recognize and report.
If you are unsure whether an email or phone call is from the University of Illinois, please contact the Help Desk by emailing consult@illinois.edu or by phone at 217-244-7000. When in doubt, please contact the Help Desk.
If you receive a phishing email claiming to be from the University of Illinois you may simply delete it. However, reporting the email can help the University to improve our mitigation strategies and reduce the number of account compromises. To report an email as spam simply forward the email in question to report-spam@illinois.edu.
The University will continue to actively monitor and react to phishing attacks. Your partnership is key to reducing the number of successful “phishes”. For more information about phishing and how to spot it please visit https://answers.uillinois.edu/illinois/page.php?id=48243.

I am pleased to announce Professor Rashid Bashir as dean of the College of Engineering, effective November 1, 2018, pending approval by the University of Illinois Board of Trustees. Professor Bashir currently serves as the Executive Associate Dean and Chief Diversity Officer for the Carle Illinois College of Medicine and holds the Grainger Distinguished Chair in Engineering.
Professor Bashir joined the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2007 as a professor of electrical and computer engineering. His research interests include bio-nanotechnology, BioMEMs, lab on a chip, interfacing of biology and engineering from the molecular to the tissue scale, and applications of semiconductor fabrication to biomedical engineering, all applied to solving biomedical problems. Prior to his current appointment, he held a number of key administrative positions, including serving as the director of the Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory and head of the Department of Bioengineering. Professor Bashir played an integral role in the conceptual development and planning of the engineering-based Carle Illinois College of Medicine in 2015. He co-led the formation of the ongoing campus-wide Mayo Clinic and Illinois Alliance for Technology-Based Healthcare with the Mayo Clinic around individualized medicine, cancer, and computational genomics. He was also instrumental in guiding the creation of the Health Care Engineering Systems Center at Illinois and the Jump Applied Research for Community Health through Engineering and Simulation (Jump ARCHES) partnership with OSF HealthCare in Peoria.
I wish to express my sincere gratitude to Professor Tamer Başar for his service as interim dean since January of this year. Under his leadership, the College’s excellence has continued to advance, and he has set a solid foundation for the future under the new dean. I also want to thank members of the search committee, chaired by Vice Chancellor for Research Susan Martinis, for their efforts to bring forward such a talented and accomplished pool of candidates.
Please join me in congratulating Rashid Bashir on his appointment as the next dean of the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

We would like to provide you with an update regarding an attempted robbery yesterday on campus. You received a Campus Safety Notice on Sunday night after it was reported that two teenagers struck a student walking on the main Quad and attempted to take the student’s cellphone.
University of Illinois Police have identified all people involved. The two teenagers responsible for the robbery attempt were interviewed by officers today and taken to the Youth Detention Center. We cannot disclose the identity of those involved because they are under 17 years old.
We are very much thankful the campus community members who provided information which aided in the investigation of this incident. Remember that police officers are always available and willing to help if you ever feel that your safety is at risk. Please do not hesitate to call 9-1-1 to report crime or suspicious activity.
This is our community. Let's stay together.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I.

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This Campus Safety Notice is issued in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about crime to aid in the prevention of similar crimes and to assist in the identification of offenders.
This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, please visit CrimeReports.com or visit the University of Illinois Police Department to view the daily crime log.
The following attempted robbery took place at 6:40 p.m. on Sunday, October 7, 2018, outside of the Chemistry Annex, 601 S. Mathews Ave., Urbana (map):
A U. of I. student was walking across the main Quad, where he was approached by three young people on bicycles. It was reported that they began to yell at the student, and two of the three struck him and demanded his cellphone. A brief struggle over the cellphone ensued before bystanders approached to help, and the young people rode away. The student was not injured.
One of the offenders was described as a black male in his teens wearing a white T-shirt. Another was a black male in a red-orange T-shirt. All three were riding bicycles, and one of the bicycles was black and neon green. Witnesses were unable to provide a description of the third person, who was not involved in striking the student.
Information about the race or ethnicity of alleged offenders is provided only to aid detailed descriptions that include physical stature, clothing or unusual characteristics. Racial descriptions do not, by themselves, offer a meaningful picture of an individual’s appearance.
The University of Illinois Police Department has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area, and we are fortunate to have our force supplemented by the Urbana and Champaign police departments. Between these agencies, the Urbana campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 1,800 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.

In order to maintain an effective emergency response and evacuation plan, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign recently completed a test including two components: a drill and an exercise. The test was designed to challenge our emergency response procedures and how we notify you of a threat to our campus community.
On Sept. 4, we initiated a test of our Illini-Alert emergency notification system. The drill was announced ahead of time by a mass email to campus and an Eweek notice to faculty and staff. The Illini-Alert system sent an email to the campus email addresses of all active faculty, staff and students. Those who have registered alternate email addresses also received a notification. Those who have registered a cellphone number were sent a text message during this drill.
Illini-Alert messages are also posted to Facebook, Twitter, digital signage and on campus websites through our Emergency Web Alert System. This approach increases the speed and breadth of our distribution of emergency notifications, and it provides a robust communication engine that will continue to function successfully even if one system fails to work properly.
For the second component, university personnel and emergency responders from a number of local agencies gathered for a functional exercise on Sept. 28 from 8 a.m. to noon at the Illinois Fire Service Institute. The exercise was announced in an Eweek notice to faculty and staff, and those involved were presented with a scenario involving a natural disaster that directly affected campus. The exercise tested various components of the Campus Emergency Operations Plan, including evacuation procedures.
This test was conducted to ensure we have a robust response plan in the event of a campus emergency, and that our emergency notifications will reach you in a timely and effective manner. If you have not signed up to receive emergency messages through Illini-Alert, please visit http://emergency.illinois.edu/ to register.
To view the University’s emergency response and evacuation procedures, please visit http://go.illinois.edu/EmergencyResponse.
The University of Illinois Police Department is committed to maintaining a safe and secure campus environment where education, research and public service can flourish. We can only do so with the assistance of our community, and we hope this information is useful to all of our campus partners.
Sincerely,
Lieutenant Todd ShortUniversity of Illinois Police DepartmentOffice of Campus Emergency Management"

To strengthen our commitment to promoting healthy lifestyles for our campus community, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will become 100 percent smoke and tobacco-free beginning August 2019. The new effort builds upon the smoke-free policy that was successfully implemented in 2014, banning the use of all smoke-producing tobacco products on campus.
The new policy will apply to everyone – students, faculty, students and visitors. It will include all forms of tobacco, including but not limited to chewing tobacco, snuff, snus and dissolvable forms such as orbs and strips. Vaping devices such as e-cigarettes and juules will also be prohibited. The banned locations will include all campus-owned property – indoors and outdoors – as well as private vehicles parked on campus-owned property. 
The campus has established a tobacco-free campus task force to ensure the policy will be communicated clearly and implemented effectively. This committee consists of a diverse group of faculty, staff and students from across campus.
In addition, Campus Wellbeing Services will be conducting focus groups to obtain input from various campus stakeholders. The committee, in partnership with Campus Wellbeing Services, is also working to put together a series of materials to help address any questions or concerns. I encourage you to utilize the feedback form and visit the Smoke-Free Campus website often as information will be added in the coming months.
To help faculty, staff and students adapt to the new policy, the campus will continue offering a variety of tobacco-cessation programs through McKinley Health Center and Campus Wellbeing Services.
I ask everyone to respect our new policy to create a healthy environment for our entire campus community.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

I am delighted to share the University of Illinois System's new economic impact study, which was announced during today’s Board of Trustees meeting.
The findings show that the U of I System contributes an impressive $17.5 billion annually to the Illinois economy through our academic and research operations, our healthcare and entrepreneurial enterprises, and the spending of our alumni, students and visitors. The U of I System's impact supports more than 171,300 jobs –  one out of every 46 jobs in Illinois. And our universities provide an enviable return on investment for taxpayers and for students, who receive $5 in career earnings for every $1 they spend on their education.
I hope you are as proud as I am of the findings, detailed in the news release below, and thank you for everything you do to make the U of I System a key engine of progress for our state and nation.
Sincerely,
Tim

U of I System impact: $17.5 billion annually on Illinois economy Study also finds system supports 171,000 jobs; one of every 46 statewide
URBANA, Ill. —The University of Illinois System pumps $17.5 billion into the Illinois economy annually and supports 171,000 jobs – one in every 46 jobs across the state, according to a new economic impact study released today.
Through spending by its three universities, employees, students and the increased earnings power of its graduates, the U of I System accounts for 2.2 percent of Illinois’ gross state product, nearly matching the total of the entire hotel and food services industry, based on findings presented to the University of Illinois Board of Trustees.
The system is also an investment that pays dividends for both students and taxpayers, according to the study by Idaho-based Emsi, an international labor market analytics firm that has completed more than 1,800 studies for higher education institutions.
For every dollar that students put into their education, including out-of-pocket costs and income lost while they study rather than work, they receive $5 in career earnings – a 15.4 percent annual return, the study found. By comparison, the average 30-year return on the U.S. stock market is 10.1 percent, according to Emsi.
Every taxpayer dollar invested in the U of I System nets $2.40, or a 6.4 percent annual return over the course of students’ lifetimes, according to the study.
The U of I System’s annual impact is up nearly 26 percent since Emsi’s last analysis three years ago. The $3.6 billion in growth is a result of factors such as rising enrollments over the past six years and the addition of operations that were not included in the last analysis, such as the system’s healthcare enterprise.
“I am thrilled that our universities continue to have such a dramatic impact on the lives of our students and the fortunes of our state,” said Tim Killeen, president of the U of I System. “The study’s findings reinforce our value to students and taxpayers, alike, and signal that we never stop working to better serve our crucial role in moving Illinois forward.”
Among other findings of the study, based on data for the fiscal year that ran from July 1, 2016, to June 30, 2017:
The spending of hundreds of thousands of alumni who live and work in Illinois accounted for $10.1 billion of the system’s $17.5 billion annual impact. Academic and research operations contributed $4.9 billion; hospital and healthcare operations, $1.5 billion; companies launched through research, nearly $679 million; student spending, nearly $306 million; and spending by visitors to the universities, nearly $40 million.
The study documented substantial earning power for U of I System alumni. For example, the average bachelor’s degree graduate from U of I universities will earn $30,300 more annually than a high school graduate, netting about $1.3 million more in career earnings.
The U of I System supports more than 171,000 jobs in Illinois through the operations of its universities and healthcare enterprise, the companies launched through its research, and the spending of students, visitors and alumni. With 7.8 million jobs in Illinois, the study found that one of every 46 are supported by the system’s operations and its graduates.
The state also benefits from the enhanced well-being of U of I graduates, who contribute to their communities through higher rates of employment, better health, and lower rates of crime compared to non-graduates.
The Emsi study also analyzed the specific impact of the U of I System’s universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield. The 2015 report, based on fiscal year 2014 financial data, looked only at the system as a whole.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign pumps $8.9 billion into the state economy annually. That accounts for 1.1 percent of gross state product and is larger than the state’s arts, entertainment and recreation industry. The university supports more than 88,000 jobs, representing one of every 89 jobs across the state.
For every dollar that Urbana-Champaign students put into their education, they receive $4.70 in career earnings – a 14.5 percent annual return. The average bachelor’s degree graduate will earn $30,800 more annually than a high school graduate, netting about $1.4 million more in career earnings.
The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) contributes $7.6 billion to the state economy annually. That accounts for 1 percent of gross state product and is also larger than the state’s arts, entertainment and recreation industry. The university supports about 73,500 jobs, representing one of every 106 jobs across the state.
For every dollar that UIC students put into their education, they receive $5.30 in career earnings – a 16.5 percent annual return. The average bachelor’s degree graduate will earn $29,500 more annually than a high school graduate, netting about $1.3 million more in career earnings.
The University of Illinois at Springfield (UIS) adds nearly $834 million to the state economy annually, and supports more than 8,100 jobs.
For every dollar that UIS students put into their education, they receive $6.30 in career earnings – a 20.1 percent annual return. The average bachelor’s degree graduate will earn $30,500 more annually than a high school graduate, netting about $1.2 million more in career earnings.
A summary of the system and university studies is available at go.uillinois.edu/EconomicImpact.
Killeen said additional studies are currently underway to analyze the projected impact of the Discovery Partners Institute and Illinois Innovation Network, statewide research and education initiatives that the U of I System is leading to drive discovery and economic growth.
###
The University of Illinois System is a world leader in research and discovery, and the largest educational institution in the state with nearly 85,600 students, about 25,000 faculty and staff, and universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield. The U of I System awards more than 22,000 undergraduate, graduate and professional degrees annually."

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes on or immediately adjacent to campus property.
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes. We are not including certain details in this alert so as to avoid releasing identifying information about the victim.
The University of Illinois Police Department received the following report on Monday from a Campus Security Authority: Between 2-3 a.m. Sunday at a university residence hall, a male student was approached in a hallway by two women, one of whom touched the student inappropriately. The student did not know the women, and no offender description was provided.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android. All messages to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of identifying information and forwarded to police by an independent third party.
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.
If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another person, intervene if it’s safe to do so or call for assistance.
While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. The university, community organizations and local law enforcement offer a number of reporting options.
Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.
It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. For the University to be in compliance with Federal Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Regulations we are required to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Information about this program can be found here:
http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/
The webpage was prepared in accordance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989. It describes the University’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse, makes clear the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard, and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and provides university and community resources to help with drug or alcohol related problems.
This program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and all new employees in accordance with federal guidelines, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources included within the report.
Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. Civil service employees should contact Staff Human Resources at (217) 333-3101 and academic staff can contact Academic Human Resources at (217) 333-6747.

I write to share with you the public report on the first Critical Conversation on Native American Imagery we held last spring. You can read and download the full report here and I encourage you to do so when you have the opportunity.
From the results of the spring Critical Conversation, I take great encouragement that this is a path within our reach, as long as we map it out together. From discussions, questions and ideas that emerged throughout this process, it is clear that we are in a different time and place today than in 2007. There is growing consensus that we can – and must – find a solution that lets us all find a way to put the future wellbeing of the university first.
I believe that we are at a watershed moment and have before us the chance to build new traditions together. We can build a deeper and more broadly shared understanding of Native American/American Indian experiences, and we can inspire all members of the Illinois family to take a shared pride in the accomplishments of our university.
I want to thank Mr. Dan Maloney and Mr. Kevin Gover whose insights and viewpoints on Chief Illiniwek and the history of Native American imagery catalyzed the frank, honest and illuminating conversations that are recounted in this report. And I also thank Rev. Dr. Allan Boesak for his own observations and moderation of the event. Most importantly, we owe our collective gratitude to the nearly 600 people who took part in this Critical Conversation process and offered their insights and honest perspectives.
Once again, I hope you will follow the link and read the report. And more broadly, I hope you will take advantage of the opportunities that we will be offering across many of these categories of recommendations to engage with us honestly and respectfully and constructively as we work to heal our past divisions and create a future that brings all of us together for the university.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This Campus Safety Notice is issued in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about crime to aid in the prevention of similar crimes and to assist in the identification of offenders.
This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, please visit CrimeReports.com or visit the University of Illinois Police Department to view the daily crime log.
The following assault occurred sometime before 2:49 a.m. Saturday, Sept. 1, at a fraternity house:
It is believed that a drug was placed in a U. of I. student’s drink during a party at a fraternity house. The student had visited two fraternity houses earlier in the night, but it is not clear at which house the incident occurred. The student left the party with friends and called an ambulance upon feeling the effects of the drug. After a medical evaluation, paramedics believed some sort of “upper” was placed in the drink. The student was not otherwise physically injured.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android.

2018-08-30T15:44:00Z,2018-08-30,15:44,79582,Traffic and pedestrian safety,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28488.html,"Dear campus community member,
Everyone here at the University of Illinois Police Department is excited to have our students back on campus. As the semester begins, this high volume of pedestrian and vehicular traffic creates more opportunities for accidents and injuries. We take this threat seriously, and our officers will be particularly watchful during the next few weeks for violations of traffic laws. Our goal is to educate, not just to write tickets. We want our campus community to share the road safely.
These are among some of the points we will be working to clarify as officers conduct these educational patrols:
Pedestrians do not always have the right of way at crosswalks. You must give oncoming traffic enough time to slow down and yield before entering a crosswalk. Use caution even after you have safely entered the crosswalk, as drivers may not always see you. Make eye contact with drivers, and do not walk distracted.
Motorists should slow down and yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk and to bicyclists in the roadway. Remember that bicyclists are entitled to use any lane, even if there is a designated bike lane. Treat them like you would any other vehicle. Also, driving while using a cellphone is illegal in Illinois and extremely dangerous, especially in areas with a lot of pedestrian and bicycle traffic.
Bicyclists in the roadway are subject to all laws which apply to vehicles, and bicyclists on the sidewalk are subject to all pedestrian laws. Be predictable – failure to obey stop signs or red lights is illegal, creates dangerous hazards and puts you at risk for serious injury.
No matter what form of transportation you choose, we all have a responsibility to avoid accidents by slowing down, sharing the road and, most importantly, being respectful to all other roadway users. Remember that not everyone may know the rules, so be alert at all times.
You can visit police.illinois.edu/safety for more tips regarding personal safety and the services we provide. As always, thank you for being an active participant in the safety of our entire campus community, and good luck this semester. We will be here if you need us.
Sincerely,
Craig A. Stone

Together, they have been a springboard to success for more than 700,000 alumni and an incubator for pioneering innovation that has changed the world.
Our universities are home to best-in-class faculty and academic programs that attract top students like you from every corner of our state and nation, and every continent. They have come in record numbers each of the last five years, and we expect enrollment to reach another new high this fall, topping 84,000 students.

We have an ambitious strategy to build on our excellence, focused on our bedrock commitment to student access and affordability and to world-class faculty and facilities. Our investments will attract new generations of students to follow in your footsteps and ensure that your U of I degree is forever synonymous with pride, respect and opportunity.

2018-08-27T09:24:00Z,2018-08-27,9:24,18005,Introducing Illinois Commitment: A tuition promise plan for...,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28481.html,"Dear Colleagues,
Today we formally announce an ambitious new initiative to make an Illinois education more accessible to even more residents of our state. We call it the Illinois Commitment, a tuition promise plan that makes it easier for more students from low- and moderate-income families to attend the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Beginning with first-time freshmen and new transfer students in the fall of 2019, all tuition and campus fees will be fully covered for four years if an in-state student’s family income is $61,000 (the median for the state) or less.
Four years. Free tuition. It really is that simple.  
The goal of the Illinois Commitment is to ensure all of our state’s most promising and talented high school students put Illinois at the top of their lists when they start the college application process. Each year, too many of these highly qualified students look at a single cost-of-attendance number and don’t even start an admissions application because they don’t believe we are an affordable choice for them. The Illinois Commitment is a bold and necessary step to simplify the concept of financial aid and open the door to an Illinois education for more families in our state. It will provide more access with fewer obstacles and leave our graduates with less student debt.
When Illinois residents go out of state for college, there is a good chance they don’t come back - contributing to a “brain drain” that undermines the future of the entire state. With the Illinois Commitment, we gain a new competitive edge to recruit the best new students, and our state keeps our talented young minds in Illinois.
We are all excited to launch this program today and look forward to welcoming our first recipients of the Illinois Commitment support to the Illinois family next fall. We begin accepting applications for the entering class of 2019 in just a few days, and I’m confident we’re going to see many more Illinois residents exploring the opportunities that can only be found at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

I am pleased to announce Professor Kevin Hamilton as dean designate of the College of Fine and Applied Arts (FAA). He is currently a full professor of new media in the School of Art + Design and senior associate dean in the college. Professor Hamilton’s new role will be effective August 17, pending approval by the University of Illinois Board of Trustees.
A member of the Illinois faculty since 2002, Professor Hamilton’s work as an artist and scholar has earned support from the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Illinois Arts Council. In addition to his art exhibition and commission career, he has published on the role of photography in nuclear weapons research and on the perception of bias in algorithmic systems. In his service in the dean’s office Professor Hamilton was instrumental in overhauling the promotion and tenure process, systematizing the college’s HR practices and has been a tireless advocate for diversity and inclusion at all levels of the organization.
Following a national search for this position, I consulted with the search committee, the College of Fine and Applied Arts executive committee and administrative council and with Chancellor Robert Jones. Professor Hamilton emerged as the best candidate to serve as the next leader of FAA. Professor Hamilton has agreed to serve in the dean position for a three-year appointment.
I wish to express my sincere gratitude to Peter Mortensen for his service as interim dean for the past year. Under his leadership, the college’s excellence has continued to advance and laid a solid foundation for future growth and success. I also want to thank the members of the search committee, chaired by Illinois Program for Research in the Humanities Director Antoinette Burton, for their efforts and commitment to this search.
Please join me in congratulating Kevin Hamilton on his appointment as dean designate of the College of Fine and Applied Arts at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

As we have done in the past, we’re once again asking you to help us distribute important safety information to our students. Emergencies can happen anywhere and at any time, so it’s important that we take a minute to prepare ourselves for a situation in which our safety could depend on our ability to react quickly.
Before the first day of class this semester, we ask that you visit http://police.illinois.edu/instructor-resources. There, you’ll find two items: A brief script we hope you will read on the first day of class and a one-page handout that we would like to have distributed to all students either by hand or as part of your syllabus.
These two items contain valuable information that can keep us all safer in the event that a fire, weather emergency or active threat should emerge. By distributing this information, we are ensuring that everyone in our campus community is empowered with tools they can use to protect themselves and others.
We also encourage you to empower yourself by visiting http://police.illinois.edu/safe. There are steps you can take right now to prepare should you find yourself in an emergency situation.

Below is an email that was sent to all Illinois students this morning. The message provides a summary of the results for a sexual misconduct survey we conducted in the spring of 2017, as well as a link to view the full report on the We Care website.
In the email, I share with students my commitment to work together as a community to eliminate the problem of sexual misconduct on campus. Together we can make our campus a safe and welcoming place for everyone.
Please review the detailed report so you are aware of the findings and prepared to direct students to resources of support should they request them.
Thank you for everything you do for our students!
Message sent to students 8/9/2018:
Dear Students:
Sexual misconduct is prevalent in our society and the University of Illinois is not immune. We are working to improve the campus climate, so we asked you to tell us about your experiences in classrooms, residence halls, apartments, the library, bars, restaurants, and everywhere in the community.
By understanding what is happening and what you think about how the University will respond, we can better address this critical issue and ensure that you have the best experience possible as an Illinois student.
Here is what you told us:
You tell your friends or family, not necessarily University authorities, of sexual misconduct, so we need to increase efforts to help you, your teachers, all our employees and your parents learn about the resources available to help, and we need to make sure you know that we are committed to supporting you.
You understand that we will respect your privacy and keep reports of sexual misconduct confidential.
You are fairly confident that the University will handle incidents appropriately. Programs such as First Year Campus Acquaintance Rape Education (FYCARE), ICARE Bystander Intervention, the We Care website and other promotional materials must be continued and enhanced.
Although being under the influence of alcohol is not an excuse or reason for sexual misconduct, there is a relationship between the misuse of alcohol and sexual misconduct. We will use this information to help you better understand this relationship and the dangers of being under the influence of alcohol in certain settings.
We greatly appreciate the time many of you took to share your experiences. During the 2017 spring semester, 12,500 graduate and undergraduate students were invited to take part in a survey. Of those invited, 2,420 students completed the survey and the respondents reflect current student demographics. I am committed to continuing this effort to understand the student experience around sexual misconduct and doing whatever I can to improve the climate on campus. We will hold focus groups to explore more ways to improve our response to survivors.
As the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, I am committed to garnering the resources of all departments to eliminate the problem of sexual misconduct on campus. The Chancellor, Provost, and all executives of the University share my dedication to this important mission. We need you to help us by looking out for each other, intervening when you see a potential problem and helping your friends and family find resources when they feel they have been the victim of sexual misconduct.

Many of you are likely aware of the Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) and Illinois Innovation Network (IIN), two key parts of the University of Illinois System’s research and innovation agenda. The DPI/IIN project has received quite a lot of attention in recent weeks, particularly after the state announced an allocation of $500 million to support DPI/IIN in its budget for the current fiscal year.
We know everyone is interested in learning more about the initiatives, so we are setting up a series of informal DPI and IIN Information and Discussion Forums at each of our universities later this month. These meetings will be open to all faculty and staff.
During the DPI and IIN Information and Discussion Forum meetings, Vice President for Economic Development and Innovation Ed Seidel and I will outline the impressive progress that has already been made on DPI/IIN, a statewide research enterprise that will accelerate discovery, job creation and economic growth.
Much has happened in the few short months since these initiatives were announced, including opening an office in Chicago, establishing new academic and corporate partnerships, organizing our first educational programs, and helping secure the $500 million in funding from the state. During these meetings, there also will be plenty of time for you to share your insights and get answers to your questions about how DPI and IIN might impact you, your units, your campuses, your students, and the state of Illinois.
Here is the schedule for the meetings, open to all faculty and staff:
• University of Illinois at Springfield – 3:30 to 4:30 p.m., Tuesday, August 28, Student Union, Ballroom• University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign – 3:30 to 5 p.m., Wednesday, August 29, Illini Union, South Lounge• University of Illinois at Chicago – 3:30 to 5 p.m., Thursday, August 30, Student Center East, Rooms A & B
I hope you can find time to join us, and thank you for everything you do for the U of I System.
Sincerely,
Tim
The DPI and IIN Information and Discussion Forum meetings have been designated as an approved event for non-exempt civil service employees. These employees may attend, without having to charge a benefit, operations permitting and with prior supervisory approval."

We would like to provide you with an update regarding an incident in June involving inappropriate sexual contact. You received a Campus Safety Notice on June 13 after it was reported that a man had made suggestive comments to a student walking near Japan House and then slapped the student’s backside.
The man believed to be responsible was arrested Friday in Charleston, Illinois. You can visit the University of Illinois Police website for more information about the person arrested and the ongoing investigation: https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/6221/676339.
Information provided by witnesses was crucial in helping to identify the person responsible, and we are very much thankful to our community members who worked with us to bring resolution to this case. Remember that police officers are always available and willing to help if you ever feel that your safety is at risk. Please do not hesitate to call 9-1-1 to report crime or suspicious activity.
This is our community. Let's stay together.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks escort if you need one.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 9-1-1 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.
If you choose to consume alcohol, please be responsible. Remember your ability to respond is diminished by overconsumption of alcohol.

We are pleased to announce that the campus has selected 14 proposed projects to receive a total of more than $5 million in the second round of funding for the Investment for Growth program. The selected projects will allow us to continue succeeding in our mission as our state’s flagship public research university by advancing our scholarly excellence and developing new sources of revenue consistent with our educational and research priorities and objectives.
Among the new projects: a humanities professional resources center, a neurology behavioral assessment laboratory, a Master of Science degree in Management and a program to develop curriculum and training for educators to teach computer science. View the full list of this year’s funded projects here. You can also learn more about the Investment for Growth program here.
Colleges and institutes were invited to submit Investment for Growth proposals with details on funding models, demand and potential impact. The proposals were evaluated by the Campus Budget Oversight Committee, deans and other senior leadership in the spring.
Evaluation criteria included financial feasibility, enhancing the student experience, alignment with industry demand, likelihood of stability, increasing efficiency and, first and foremost, centered on continued excellence across our scholarly missions of teaching, research and public engagement. Many of the proposals have multiple sources of investment, including other internal and external funding, in addition to the Investment for Growth seed money. More than half of the Investment for Growth proposals were chosen for funding.
This year’s proposals represent eight colleges. We expect the next call for proposals, planned for this fall, to encourage even more multi-disciplinary and multi-unit collaborations across campus. If you have an idea for an Investment for Growth proposal, we encourage you to talk to your department head and dean.
Thank you to everyone who worked on a proposal. As we look to our future, we need to continue to be proactive and innovative in our funding model. The Investment for Growth program provides a transparent and strategic opportunity to invest in our future.

For the University to be in compliance with Federal Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Regulations we are required to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Information about this program can be found here:
http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/
The webpage was prepared in accordance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989. It describes the University’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse, makes clear the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard, and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and provides university and community resources to help with drug or alcohol related problems.
This program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and all new employees in accordance with federal guidelines, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources included within the report.

As you may know, the Marketing Advisory Council (MAC) has been continuing the branding work begun by the Edelman agency several years ago. The next step they are taking in building the university’s brand platform involves distributing a survey later today to a random sample of alumni, donors, students, prospective students, faculty and staff to validate the Edelman research on the perceptions our stakeholders share about the university.
The overall goal of this work is to position our institution in the competitive marketplace in a unique and compelling way that is relevant and believable for our stakeholders. This work will provide the foundation necessary to build and implement a cohesive brand strategy that effectively defines and communicates the promise of what the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign does and its impact – with a bold and unified approach.
The MAC, Public Affairs and the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Institutional Advancement are guiding this effort and have been keeping your Chief Communications Officers updated on their progress. I intend to begin a search for a Chief Marketing Officer for the university this summer, so strategic branding work can begin as soon as the survey results are analyzed.
If you receive any questions or concerns from those who are asked to complete the survey, please direct them to Associate Chancellor for Public Affairs Robin Kaler at 333-5010 or rkaler@illinois.edu.

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This Campus Safety Notice is issued in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about crime to aid in the prevention of similar crimes and to assist in the identification of offenders.
This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, please visit CrimeReports.com or visit the University of Illinois Police Department to view the daily crime log.
The following incident took place at 7:05 p.m. Tuesday in the 2000 block of South Lincoln Avenue, Urbana (map):
It was reported that a U. of I. student was walking near Japan House when a man appeared and began to follow. The man made several suggestive comments about the student’s appearance, slapped the student on the buttocks and then walked away.
The offender was described as a short, heavyset white man with blonde hair in a ponytail. He was wearing a black shirt and red shorts at the time of the incident.
Information about the race or ethnicity of alleged offenders is provided only to aid detailed descriptions that include physical stature, clothing or unusual characteristics. Racial descriptions do not, by themselves, offer a meaningful picture of an individual’s appearance.
The University of Illinois Police Department has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area, and we are fortunate to have our force supplemented by the Urbana and Champaign police departments. Between these agencies, the Urbana campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 1,700 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android. All messages to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of identifying information and forwarded to police by an independent third party.

I am delighted to announce a 2 percent, merit-based salary program for the 2018-19 academic year.
The program is another investment in our most valuable resource – you, our employees – and I am grateful for the recent approval of a full-year state budget that helps provide the funding and stability to recognize your hard work and commitment.
A competitive compensation program is essential to reward and retain the faculty and staff who are the very core of our excellence, and are lifting us toward our ambitious vision of an even brighter future. This new program reaffirms a commitment to annual, predictable pay raises that remained a priority even during a recent two-year state budget impasse that significantly reduced funding for operations.
The program will take effect Aug. 16, providing performance-based increases that will vary by individual but will average 2 percent across units. The merit-based program will be applicable to most academic and civil service employees, except for employees whose wages are set through the collective bargaining process. Those employees may be eligible for an increase based upon the negotiation process and the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreement.
My deepest thanks for all you do to make the University of Illinois System a global leader in education and innovation, and a key engine of progress for our state.

The Procedures outline the requirements that apply to all members of our university community, including University personnel, volunteers and contractors associated with events/activities where minors will be involved.
We require that units with programs or activities designed to include minors who are not enrolled at the University report those activities to the University of Illinois Police Department on the supplied forms found at http://go.illinois.edu/protection-of-minors/.
As reflected in our University’s procedures, units shall not allow any adult person who is responsible for the supervision of minors, or whose duties would require close contact with minors (who are not enrolled or accepted for enrollment at the University) to participate in a University program or activity designed to include minors without verifying the person has undergone a criminal background check and a sex offender registry check. Please review the Procedures for additional information about this requirement.
The University Ethics Office has also produced a 5-minute animated Protection of Minors video to promote and improve awareness of the Protection of Minors Policy, and we encourage the use of this video as a training tool in your unit.

We are very pleased to share the news that the University of Illinois System will receive increased funding for operations and its first state capital funding in nine years under a fiscal year 2019 budget approved today by Illinois legislators and sent to the governor.
The budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 will provide an $11.6 million increase for day-to-day operations at our three universities, up 2 percent to $594.6 million compared to fiscal 2018 appropriations.
It will also provide the U of I System’s first state capital appropriations since fiscal year 2010. That includes $500 million to support development of the Discovery Partners Institute (DPI), a research center we will lead that was announced last fall. DPI will build on our long history of discovery and will be the centerpiece of our statewide Illinois Innovation Network (IIN), which will accelerate research breakthroughs to create new businesses, new jobs and economic growth across the state.
The state’s second straight, full-year budget reflects a much-needed return of stability and reinvestment in higher education after a two-year impasse that cut sharply into funding and hampered our ability to plan our future.
Thanks to the creativity and commitment of our faculty, staff, students, alumni and friends, the U of I System weathered those financial challenges with its excellence intact. Now, another year of investment by the state will enable us to continue our strong, positive momentum toward the high-aspiration goals of our Strategic Framework and associated plans.
We will invest to extend affordability efforts that include a four-year, in-state tuition freeze; to build on enrollment growth that has set system-wide records for five straight years; to expand the world-class faculty and facilities that define our classroom and research excellence; and to support the public good through groundbreaking initiatives such as DPI and the IIN. We will invest in our unwavering commitment to the people of Illinois, whose loyalty and generosity over the last 150 years have made the U of I System a key engine of progress.
The budget also would provide:
About $145.2 million for capital projects across the U of I System, including $116 million in funding for projects that had been delayed from prior appropriations such as the Advanced Chemical Technology Building in Chicago, the Public Safety Building in Springfield and the Integrated Bioresearch Laboratory in Urbana-Champaign.
Statewide, $401 million for the Monetary Award Program, which provides financial aid to support Illinois students, including thousands across our universities.
About $25 million for a new state scholarship program that would be created to encourage in-state students to attend college in Illinois and stem an outmigration of talent to other states. The U of I System and other universities would be asked to match the state’s contribution.
Our deepest thanks to everyone across the system who shared their time and talents to advocate on our behalf, including Illinois Connection’s annual U of I days at the capital and email campaigns.
We also are grateful to legislators, including our U of I Caucus, for the bipartisan cooperation to forge a budget agreement. Their hard work will provide the certainty and resources that are essential to achieve the important goals that we all share.

As President Killeen said in his message to you earlier today, the University of Illinois System joined other public universities in talks with the State Universities Civil Service System (SUCSS) to develop new criteria for exempting positions from the civil service system. 
Throughout the revision process, we worked diligently and at Chancellor Jones’ direction, to maintain as much flexibility as possible, and the new exemption criteria still allows us to exempt many positions from civil service. We are now preparing the systems necessary to implement the revised procedures in a way that supports our missions of learning, discovery, and engagement.
The new Exemption Procedures Manual takes effect October 1, 2018. On that date, Illinois Human Resources (IHR) will begin using the new criteria for vacancies and appointment changes. It is important to note that this change does not require that we automatically reclassify current AP positions to Civil Service.
Illinois Human Resources will work with units to ensure that they retain the ability to make hiring decisions based on the specific knowledge and skills they need for a certain position. As an institution, we will continue to aggressively recruit, promote, and retain qualified, skilled employees as do our peer institutions, some of which also have civil service systems.
We have created a Professional Employment Redesign website to offer information about the new criteria and upcoming process changes as we move forward with the transition. We will update this site with new information as it becomes available. 
We value the contributions of employees in all job classifications, and we are confident that the new processes will allow units to continue to hire, promote, and retain world-class professionals.
Best regards,
Elyne G. ColeAssociate Provost for Human Resources"

Over the last year, the University of Illinois System joined other public universities in talks with the State Universities Civil Service System (SUCSS) to develop new procedures for exempting positions from the civil service system.
I write to share the news that an agreement has been reached that complies with state law while still allowing us to exempt academic professional positions from the civil service system, as appropriate. The system and university human resource offices are in the process of communicating the details of the new procedures and implementation plans.
This has been a tremendous effort by many stakeholders across the state, including our system and university human resources staff, system and university leadership, employee advisory committees, and members of our Board of Trustees who also serve on the SUCSS merit board.
I am grateful to all of them and to SUCSS for their vital role in developing innovative solutions that maintain our ability to hire academic professional positions. Staffing colleges, departments, and units with the best and most qualified talent to carry out our mission is crucial to our success.
Sincerely,
Tim

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This Campus Safety Notice is issued in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about crime to aid in the prevention of similar crimes and to assist in the identification of offenders.
This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, please visit CrimeReports.com or visit the University of Illinois Police Department to view the daily crime log.
At about 12:45 a.m. Sunday near First Street and Armory Avenue, Champaign, the Champaign Police Department responded to a report of a shooting. Upon arrival, officers assisted a 21-year-old man who had been shot. That person, who is not a student, was taken to the hospital for treatment of serious injuries. Preliminary information suggests that the shooting was not a random act and that the victim was the intended target. At this time, no information about the suspect or suspects is available.
The University of Illinois Police Department has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area, and we are fortunate to have our force supplemented by the Urbana and Champaign police departments. Between these agencies, the Urbana campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 1,700 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the Champaign Police Department at 217-351-4545. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android. All messages to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of identifying information and forwarded to police by an independent third party.
This is our community. Let's stay together.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Stay together.Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks escort if you need one.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.
If you choose to consume alcohol, please be responsible. Remember your ability to respond is diminished by overconsumption of alcohol.

The signs are pretty clear. Alma Mater is breaking out her cap and gown and the campus is awash with orange and blue flowers. Clearly, we are coming up fast on our 2018 Commencement and the end of our Sesquicentennial Celebration.
For those of you who will earn degrees next week, congratulations on your achievement. Whether your next step is the first in a new career, into a new educational opportunity or simply into the unknown, good luck and remember, you’re not ever alone. You are joining one of the largest and most welcoming alumni networks in the world. I know from my own experiences, you’ll find that big orange “I” in some of the most unlikely places around the planet. And it seems that no matter where you go, all it takes is a quick “I-L-L” to find another member of the Illinois family.
Many of you are still on your Illinois journey and will be returning later this year to continue your studies. To all of you, I hope this summer brings a chance to stop, take a breath and just relax at least for a little while. From there, whether it is time with family or friends, travelling, working or jumping right back into classes, I hope you enjoy a safe and re-energizing summer.
If you are feeling overwhelmed during these last busy days, please reach out to one of the many campus resources available to help. The Counseling Center (333-3704), the Student Assistance Center (333-0050) and the Emergency Dean (24 hours a day, 333-0050) are great places to start. We want you to be successful. But most of all, we want you to be safe and we want to see you back here in the fall.
To our faculty and staff, thank you for delivering a truly transformational experience to another class this year here at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Thank you for bringing such passion, concern and attention to the critical and difficult issues facing us. We have been celebrating our 150-year history of excellence in teaching, scholarship and research. But I believe the best possible way to honor that record is by setting the bar and expectations even higher for the next 150 years. That is exactly what we have seen you do this year.
Congratulations to our new graduates and best wishes to all of you for a great summer.
Sincerely,

I am delighted to let you know that Tuesday, May 1, we are holding a charrette to offer our campus and community the opportunity to provide feedback on the findings from our Conversation on Native Imagery. If you aren’t familiar with charrettes, they are meetings in which all stakeholders in a project attempt to resolve conflicts and map solutions.
The Critical Conversation on Native Imagery Charrette will be from 3-6pm in the South Lounge of the Illini Union, 1401 W. Green St., Urbana, and is designed to generate insights, concerns and ideas for moving forward. No formal program will be presented and participants can spend as little or as much time as they want to review the ideas that were generated in the Conversation and offer input, comments and questions as we chart a path forward.
The Charrette is open to the public, and light refreshments will be served. A video of the speakers from the April 10th Critical Conversation will be shown at 3pm, 4pm, and 5pm.
The Chancellor’s Critical Conversations series is designed to explore difficult issues and answer challenging questions together, as a university community. The goal of each event is to challenge beliefs, opinions and viewpoints through careful listening and the thoughtful expression of different voices, perspectives and ideas.

At the meeting of the Association of American Universities this past week, the chancellors and presidents crafted a statement strongly affirming our commitment to supporting free speech and open expression on our respective campuses. It is particularly appropriate timing coming in the same week we held a Critical Conversation on this topic.
I believe this statement that I share with you below reflects our own values and aspirations here at Illinois. As a university community, we must remain committed to creating an environment where every idea can be heard and where every individual has the freedom to voice a perspective.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor
 
AAU PRESIDENTS AND CHANCELLORS REAFFIRM COMMITMENT TO FREE SPEECH ON CAMPUS April 18, 2018
The free and open exchange of ideas and information is fundamental to the educational mission of AAU universities. The robust discussions and debates that occur at research universities have been central to the advancement of democracy, the creation of new knowledge, the fostering of educational excellence, and the promotion of social progress. As heads of these institutions we are unequivocally committed to preserving and honoring this proud heritage.
While we may deem some speech to be odious, disgraceful, and antithetical to our values, our campuses are and should remain places where ideas can be expressed free of disruption, intimidation, and violence.
We are committed to preparing our students, faculty, and staff to engage in thoughtful, non-disruptive debate. Our collective responsibility to educate our campus communities on their rights and responsibilities is of the utmost importance and one we embrace. While protecting the expression of ideas, we will also take all steps necessary to promote an inclusive and non-discriminatory learning environment, and protect our communities from those who seek to promote conflict rather than conversation, debate, and advocacy.
We will continue to prepare students, faculty, and staff to engage in frank, open, and often challenging discussions. Our universities will also work to ensure that campus policies on speech, events, dissent, and other protected activities are publicly and conveniently available. We believe these actions are critical for our institutions to remain at the forefront of ensuring that substantive and non-violent speech is fully protected and welcomed in our society.
In restating these values, we aspire to be a model for society of how a free and democratic people should work through disagreements and arrive at a deeper understanding of important issues and of each other."

Dear colleagues:
We are pleased to announce that a program providing additional paid days off during our December/January holidays has been extended to a third straight year.
Employees who are eligible for leave benefits will again receive three paid gift days for this year’s Reduced Service Days – on December 27, 28 and 31. Before the program began in 2016, employees had been required to draw from their annual pool of paid time off to be paid for the reduced service days.
The program is reflected in the FY 2019 Holiday Schedule that will be distributed to employees this month. Our universities, hospital and clinics, and system offices will follow up with more details, including how to report the gift days and how they can be used on different days by essential employees who must work on December 27, 28 or 31. As in years past, the gift day program will be evaluated after the holidays to determine whether it will be extended.
For employees in union-represented bargaining units, paid time off for the holidays is addressed through the required collective bargaining process.
Our employees are the foundation of our excellence and our global standing as a go-to destination for students and research discovery. We hope this program illustrates just how much we appreciate everything you do.

I am writing to invite you to participate in the first two sessions in a series of conversations on potentially divisive issues involving campus and community stakeholders. Next week, we will hold a conversation on Native imagery, followed a week later by another discussion on the topic of free speech.
Public universities like ours have a responsibility to be the place where public and open conversations about even the most difficult ideas and issues happen. As a society we will not find new solutions to our most pressing challenges if we cannot even talk about them. That is what we envision for this series.

The Native imagery conversation will take place April 10 from 3 to 5 p.m. in the multipurpose room on the second floor of the Student Dining and Residential Programs Building, 301 E. Gregory Drive, Champaign. Kevin Gover, the director of the National Museum of the American Indian, and Dan Maloney, an Illinois alumnus and former portrayer of Chief Illiniwek, will provide context for the conversation. Registration is required as space is limited.
The second conversation, on the topic of free speech, occurs April 17 from noon to 1 p.m. in Colwell Playhouse at Krannert Center for the Performing Arts, 500 S. Goodwin Ave., Urbana.

I write to announce that Rachel Switzky, an executive director at international design and consulting firm IDEO, has been selected to be the inaugural director of our Siebel Center for Design. She holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees in industrial design from Illinois and will begin the new role on June 18, pending approval by the Board of Trustees.
We were looking for a visionary leader who understands the transformative educational opportunities for Illinois students that the Siebel Center for Design can catalyze. Throughout her professional career, Director Switzky has been a pioneer in both the concepts and the practices of design thinking across a spectrum of disciplines. This is a powerful combination that has all of us excited to welcome her back home as the inaugural director.
She has worked with many Fortune 100 companies over the past 20 years, leading design teams in imagining and implementing digital design, emergent technologies and impact at-scale. She most recently served on the leadership team of IDEO’s 150-person studio in Palo Alto, California, managing a multi-million dollar design portfolio. Prior to joining IDEO in 2007, she worked in several capacities for the interactive agency Razorfish.
Tom Siebel’s confidence in this university is matched only by the generosity he has demonstrated to it. This latest investment to establish the Siebel Center for Design is a historic new addition to the physical and the intellectual landscape of Illinois. We are excited to have Rachel Switzky lead this new center of innovation at Illinois.
I want to thank the members of the search committee chaired by Professor William Sanders for their efforts in attracting and recruiting a pool of truly outstanding finalists for this position. And I also wish to express my gratitude to Professor Andy Singer for his service as the interim director of the Siebel Center for Design through these critical early stages of program and facility design. 
Please join me in congratulating Rachel Switzky on her new role.

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes on or immediately adjacent to campus property.
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes. To protect victims’ privacy, we generally do not include specific details about exact locations or times to avoid releasing information that could lead to the identification of a survivor and cause further harm to that person.
A Campus Security Authority has informed the University of Illinois Police Department that a sexual assault and an incident involving nonconsensual sexual conduct occurred at a fraternity house. The sexual assault was reported to have occurred about a month ago, and the date of the second incident was not reported. Both incidents involved the same offender and were reported to a Campus Security Authority on Thursday. The incidents have not been reported to the police for the purpose of criminal investigation.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to assist those involved in this incident and will continue to take actions to maintain the safety and security of the campus community.
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.
If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another person, intervene if it’s safe to do so or call for assistance.
While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. The university, community organizations and local law enforcement offer a number of reporting options.
Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.
It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.

I am excited to announce that, following an extremely productive and collaborative all-night negotiation session, the Graduate Employee Organization and the university administration have reached a tentative agreement on a new contract that will be put up for a ratification vote by the full GEO membership today and tomorrow. The full details of the agreement will be released after the ratification process has been completed.
While there have been differences at the bargaining table throughout this process, we firmly believe that the first and shared goal of everyone involved in these negotiations was to ensure continued excellence here at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The contributions of our graduate employees at Illinois are essential to every aspect of the educational and scholarly missions of one of the world’s best public research universities. We appreciate their sustained effort and commitment during this week’s bargaining sessions that led to today’s agreement.
This tentative agreement finds common ground built on those goals to ensure graduate employees at Illinois will have the financial and personal security to focus fully on the academic pursuits and aspirations that brought them here. And this agreement also guarantees our faculty the flexibility to ensure the future quality and competitiveness of our academic programs in the rapidly shifting landscape of global higher education.
This university has a 150-year legacy of attracting the brightest, most creative and most talented students and scholars. We hope the GEO membership will vote to approve this agreement in the coming days and add a significant new chapter to that story.

2018-03-02T21:38:00Z,2018-03-02,21:38,8066,University’s position on tuition waivers,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28384.html,"Dear Colleagues,
Thank you for your efforts during this week’s strike. I appreciate your patience and all you have done to help ensure that our undergraduate students continue to have the academic experience they deserve.
As you know, language around tuition waivers is one of the most publicly discussed items left to be resolved in our negotiations with the Graduate Employees Organization (GEO). You might have heard this referred to as the “side letter.”  To view the 2.25.18 version of the side letter click here.
I’m writing today to address questions I’m hearing from our faculty wondering why we are proposing new language at all. Why don’t we, as the GEO has said, simply resurrect the expired side letter on tuition waivers that was included in the previous two agreements? The short answer is that the language of the original side letter has been, on two occasions so far, subject to legal interpretations that are not at all consistent with the University’s original intent and not consistent with the principles of shared faculty governance.
The side letter was created in 2009 in an effort to address concerns about the possibility of then-current students having the terms of their waivers changed by their academic program during their academic career. This language was crafted specifically and only to offer assurances to these students that their waivers would be protected.
Since then, in two separate arbitration decisions, the actual language of the side letter has been interpreted in ways that have impacts far beyond the original intent of the agreement. These decisions have created challenges for faculty within departments who want to modify the designation of a program. Specifically, these decisions restrict a department’s ability to reclassify an existing graduate program to a self-supporting program. And they have also restricted a department’s ability to seek reimbursement for tuition costs from another department. Neither of these outcomes was ever part of the negotiation around the original side letter. These decisions decrease the role of faculty governance in the development of a coherent, sustainable strategy for graduate education at Illinois – and that is the reason why we cannot accept a final agreement with the original side letter language.
Our intent in the new side letter language is to offer those in the GEO bargaining unit tuition waiver protection while restoring the ability of departments, schools and colleges to modify programs in ways that further their educational mission. As intended in the original side letter, our language explicitly guarantees tuition waivers to bargaining unit members and safeguards the value of those waivers throughout a student’s time in an academic program. And it allows faculty within departments, schools and colleges to exercise their authority and responsibility to make decisions related to their academic programs.
There are differences between collective bargaining around employment issues and academic governance. Rather than addressing terms and conditions of employment, the original side letter cedes your authority as faculty members to make the decisions that determine the future of this institution.
Graduate education is an irreplaceable and essential cornerstone of the excellence of a public research university. We are committed to reaching a final and fair agreement as quickly as possible and I am certain the GEO shares that same goal. I am optimistic we will get through this together in a way that leads to better opportunities for everyone who comes to study at Illinois.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

The Graduate Employees Organization (GEO) strike, which began on Monday, February 26, and continued throughout the last week, has resulted in a number of class cancellations and relocations. I offer an apology to all of you for disruption to your academic experience during the past days. We have been working with our departments to ensure that they put steps in place so the educational objectives of your courses are met.
We look forward to getting back to the bargaining table, but we must prepare in case strike activities resume Monday morning. If there are cancellations, relocations, or rescheduling of any of your classes, the department offering that course is responsible for coordinating make-up arrangements and keeping you informed of any changes.
My office has added a new resource to help answer specific questions you might have about the strike and its impact on your education, which can be found here. These pages include answers to some of your most frequently asked questions. This is a public resource, and I encourage you to share this link with your parents or others who may also have questions.
Once again in the coming week, there may be GEO members or supporters protesting or picketing outside campus buildings. This is legal as long as it is peaceful and does not create a disturbance or block entrances or exits. As a student, you have every right to attend your classes. Picketers have the right to talk to you as you enter or leave, but they cannot interfere with your passage. If you have any concerns or experience any difficulties please contact the department that offers the affected class or call the University of Illinois Police Department (333.1216).
I thank you for your patience during the duration of this strike. We have been eager to return to the bargaining table with GEO to resolve our differences and reach a final and fair agreement. I am hopeful that we will resume those negotiations soon and end this period of disruption to the Illinois experience you expect to have.

On Friday, March 2, 2018, many students and visitors will participate in an event known as Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. The university does not support or condone this event.
The Champaign, Urbana, and University of Illinois police departments, assisted by other local and state agencies, will patrol the campus district on March 2. They will enforce all applicable ordinances in commercial and residential areas and have authority to intervene if private parties threaten to disturb the peace. In addition, Champaign and Urbana officials will enact retrictions on liquor sales intended to curb overconsumption. Emergency medical personnel will be available to provide care.
University police will continue to focus on protecting students, staff, faculty, and university property. If asking a disruptive student to leave class could escalate into a confrontation, you may seek assistance from these officers. Should you need to report an incident, call METCAD at 911 for emergencies, 333-8911 for non-emergencies.
As in years past, we have made clear to students that academic business will continue as usual on Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. Instructors are encouraged not to cancel classes.

2018-02-26T09:34:00Z,2018-02-26,9:34,45989,STRIKE Today!,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28377.html,"Dear Illinois family, 
On Monday, February 26, the Graduate Employees Organization will go on strike. As the representatives of the University’s graduate workers, the GEO has been negotiating for a fair contract since March 30, 2017. After almost a year of negotiations, they have been left with no alternative but to strike.
As Student Body President, I stand with graduate workers at the University. As an undergraduate student, I have been privileged to be taught by exceptional graduate instructors and teaching assistants. They are fundamental to our campus, and their work is indispensable. Their demands - tuition waivers and fees, fair wages, healthcare and equitable access to quality education- are both reasonable and entirely achievable. I hope you take a minute to read this message from the GEO, detailing their stance on the strike. 
___________________________________________________
We, the Graduate Employees’ Organization (GEO) of UIUC are the labor union for graduate workers at this campus, representing the Teaching Assistants and Graduate Assistants without whom this university could not function. UIUC depends on the labor of approximately 2,800 graduate workers, and at some point, every undergraduate student is taught by a graduate instructor. In fact, Illinois ranks 6th in the country among universities where graduate employees teach the most classes.
We have done everything in our power to win a fair contract without a strike. We have demanded a fair agreement from the Administration and bargained in good faith for close to a year, leading actions across campus to get our message out, to no avail. Now, we are forced to strike, our last resort.
The minimum salary for Teaching Assistants and Graduate Assistants’ is $16,360 a year, approximately $6,000 less than the University’s published cost of living in Champaign-Urbana. Most of us pay over $500 per semester in fees, bringing our net pay even lower. Due to this reality, many of us face housing or food insecurity. We need better. We deserve better.
Tuition Waivers are the cornerstone of graduate education and employment across the country. However, the Administration is seeking to unilaterally control the availability of Tuition Waivers. Being eligible for a Tuition Waiver is not the same as being guaranteed a Tuition Waiver. Since the dollar value of tuition is typically higher than what graduate employees earn, we would be effectively paying to work here if the Administration modified our tuition waivers. Without tuition waiver guarantees, the University would no longer be able to attract the best graduate students, undermining undergraduate education. Graduate programs would be unable to compete with peer institutions. Departments that cannot attract graduate students by paying full tuition would risk losing funding or being eliminated altogether.   
As a union of graduate employees, one of the GEO’s core missions is maintaining -- and improving -- undergraduate education. We know that our working conditions are our students’ learning conditions, and as such we can only achieve our goals as educators when we have a fair contract. Without protection from discrimination or overwork, without knowing the classes we’re going to teach in advance, and most of all without economic stability, we as graduate employees cannot provide the best possible education for our students.
The UIUC Administration claims a similar core mission, “to enhance the lives of citizens in Illinois, across the nation, and around the world through our leadership in learning, discovery, engagement and economic development."" We hope they can fulfill this mission, but not at expense of our, and your, learning. That is why we fight.
As valued members of the campus community, your support for GEO, graduate workers, and access to higher education is essential. You can support our strike by walking our picket lines, donating to our strike fund, calling or emailing the Provost’s office repeatedly to demand that they bargain with GEO to end the strike, and calling your family and friends to ask them to do the same. We need your help to succeed and to do the work that we came here to do: research, learn and teach.

We know you likely will be asked about this, so we are writing to update you on campus operations for the upcoming week and also to share information we have sent to graduate employees who are represented by the GEO.
For information regarding negotiations, strike preparation, go to: go.illinois.edu/geonegotiations.
All Academic Professional and Civil Service employees are expected to report to work and perform their job duties as usual, even if the building in which you work is being picketed. Employees, students and members of the public have a right to enter buildings without being intimidated, coerced or threatened.
Employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement are reminded that they are prohibited from engaging in sympathy strikes during their work hours. Employees who choose to engage in such action may only do so on their own time (before or after their work day, during break or lunch periods, or use of approved vacation).
University regulations on demonstrations can be found in the Campus Administrative Manual at http://cam.illinois.edu/policies/campus-demonstrations-and-protests/.
Thank you for your patience and efforts to ensure our undergraduates experience as little disruption to their education as possible in the coming days. The campus will continue bargaining in good faith and will do all that we can to reach an agreement that is fair to both parties and serves the excellence of graduate education at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

MESSAGE TO GEO REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES SENT ON FEB. 25:
Dear Members of the Graduate Employees’ Organization Bargaining Unit,
The University and the Graduate Employees’ Organization (GEO) held a five-hour session with the federal mediator in an effort to reach a new agreement and avert a strike. The University was willing to continue negotiations through that night, but the GEO has indicated that it will proceed with plans for strike on Monday.
We have been negotiating in good faith throughout this process and have made significant progress so far, reaching tentative agreements in 12 of the originally identified bargaining areas. And our proposals on the remaining issues have demonstrated significant movement responsive to the GEO’s concerns.
The current proposal explicitly guarantees tuition waivers to bargaining unit members, offers clear protections of the value of those waivers throughout a student’s academic career here and was adjusted to remove language about eligibility that the GEO said was cause for concern.
The current proposal offers a 10% increase in the minimum wage over the life of the agreement and a 3% increase in the first year for reappointed students with raises commensurate with the rest of campus in the remaining years.
The current proposal offer would raise the university’s contribution to the student health insurance fee for represented employees from 80% to 87%.
We are committed to continuing to bargain to reach an agreement that is fair and beneficial for all involved as soon as possible.
As I said in my earlier message to you, we greatly value your significant contributions to the academic and educational missions of this university.
So that you may remain informed, here is the updated side letter language submitted by the University at today’s session, The new language provided revised language in response to the GEO’s concern about the word “eligible.”The University has reserved, as part of its management rights, the right to determine and modify the graduate program tuition waiver designations. Each program, therefore, will be permitted to exercise the rights and authority associated with its designation relating to tuition waivers, regardless of whether that right or authority has been previously exercised.The University agrees that current students are governed by the waiver policy in effect at the time of first enrollment in the program as long as they remain in that program, are in good academic standing, and are making proper progress toward graduation in that program even if modifications in that program should occur. Accordingly, if the University determines that program needs have changed and elects to modify the designation or suspend future enrollment in a program, the existing students within that program will nevertheless continue to be governed by the waiver policy in effect at the time of their first enrollment in the program as long as they remain in that program, they hold a tuition waiver generating assistantship, maintain good academic standing and continue to make appropriate progress towards their degree.Similarly, if the University decides to modify the tuition waiver given to incoming students within a graduate program from a full waiver to a base-rate waiver, the University will not modify the full tuition waiver offered to the existing students within that program who hold a tuition waiver generating assistantship throughout the time that they remain in that program, provided that they maintain good academic standing and continue to make appropriate progress towards their degree.All doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) degree programs will continue to grant tuition waivers. The University will guarantee funding to those students enrolled in a Ph.D. graduate program for a period of five (5) academic years provided that they (1) held a University provided tuition-waiver generating assistantship or fellowship throughout the first year (of the five year period) of their enrollment in that program, (2) remain enrolled in that same program, (3) continue to satisfactorily perform the duties of their assistantships, (4) maintain good academic standing, and (5) continue to make appropriate progress towards obtaining their degree.  The funding provided during that time period may take a variety of forms within the discretion of the University, including tuition-waiver generating graduate assistantships, teaching assistantships, research assistantships, pre-professional assistantships, and fellowships.
We will continue to negotiate and work together with your labor representative, the GEO, during this strike. We have made significant progress toward a final agreement and our goals are not separate or different here. We want to ensure Illinois’ sustainable excellence in graduate education and research by remaining competitive in attracting the most talented, hard-working and brightest graduate students in the world.
I remain optimistic that we are going to reach an agreement that does just that.
Best regards,
Andreas C. Cangellaris Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

The Graduate Employees Organization (GEO) has communicated it intends to strike beginning the morning of Monday (Feb. 26). But your classes should continue to meet for the duration of the strike and you should plan to attend as usual.
We will continue the bargaining process, and we hope we will reach an agreement that ends the strike as quickly as possible. Until that happens, our top priority will be to offer the best protection for your academic experience that we can. We are taking the necessary steps to minimize the disruption of instruction, to ensure your course objectives are met and to ensure timely grading. If there are interruptions, the department offering the affected course must implement make-up arrangements to ensure that the instructional objectives of your classes are delivered and that you are kept informed.
It is possible that your instructor may choose to relocate the class meeting location to minimize any interruption. If that happens, your instructor is responsible for notifying you of the change in a timely manner.
Depending on where your classes meet, there may be GEO members or supporters protesting or picketing outside the building. This is legal as long as it is peaceful and does not create a disturbance or block entrances or exits. As a student, you have a right to attend the classes for which you pay tuition. Picketers have the right to talk to you as you enter or leave, but they cannot interfere with your passage. If you have any concerns or experience any difficulties attending any class please contact the department that offers the affected class.
Full updates on the status of these negotiations as well as a list of frequently asked questions about the impact of the strike on your experience is on the web at go.illinois.edu/geonegotiations.
We know that you chose the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for the world-class education we promise. We will continue to deliver on that promise as we work with the union representatives to conclude the strike.

Andreas C. Cangellaris Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

MESSAGE TO GEO REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES:
Dear Members of the Graduate Employees Organization Bargaining Unit,
Yesterday’s bargaining session between the university and the Graduate Employees Union (GEO) concluded after the parties discussed the university’s most current comprehensive package proposal intended to settle the agreement and avert a strike. Further mediation is scheduled for tomorrow at noon, and the union has not withdrawn its stated intent to strike on Monday, Feb. 26. If that happens, the union will ask you not to report to work. You have the right to participate in the strike, and that decision is entirely yours to make. Your significant contributions to the academic and educational missions of this university are recognized and valued by all of our faculty and leadership, and we remain committed to bargaining in good faith and reaching an agreement that is fair and beneficial for all involved.
We have reached tentative agreement on a significant number of articles being negotiated.
So that you may remain informed, the comprehensive package proposal submitted by the University at yesterday’s session is summarized below.
Side Letter:  The University has proposed modifying a prior side letter addressing tuition waivers.

The University’s most recent proposal on the side letter is set forth below verbatim:
The University has reserved, as part of its management rights, the right to determine and modify the graduate program tuition waiver designations. Each program, therefore, will be permitted to exercise the rights and authority associated with its designation relating to tuition waivers, regardless of whether that right or authority has been previously exercised.The University agrees that current students are governed by the waiver policy in effect at the time of first enrollment in the program as long as they remain in that program, are in good academic standing, and are making proper progress toward graduation in that program even if modifications in that program should occur. Accordingly, if the University determines that program needs have changed and elects to modify the designation or suspend future enrollment in a program, the existing students within that program will nevertheless continue to remain eligible to receive tuition waiver generating assistantships throughout the time that they remain in that program, provided that they hold a tuition waiver generating assistantship, maintain good academic standing and continue to make appropriate progress towards their degree. Similarly, if the University decides to modify the tuition waiver given to incoming students within a graduate program from a full waiver to a base-rate waiver, the University will not modify the full tuition waiver offered to the existing students within that program who hold a tuition waiver generating assistantship throughout the time that they remain in that program, provided that they maintain good academic standing and continue to make appropriate progress towards their degree.All doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) degree programs will be tuition waiver eligible. The University will guarantee funding to those students enrolled in a Ph.D. graduate program for a period of five (5) academic years provided that they (1) held a University provided tuition-waiver generating assistantship or fellowship throughout the first year (of the five year period) of their enrollment in that program, (2) remain enrolled in that same program, (3) continue to satisfactorily perform the duties of their assistantships, (4) maintain good academic standing, and (5) continue to make appropriate progress towards obtaining their degree.  The funding provided during that time period may take a variety of forms within the discretion of the University, including tuition-waiver generating graduate assistantships, teaching assistantships, research assistantships, pre-professional assistantships, and fellowships.
Wages:  The university proposed increasing the minimum salary of represented employees by 4% during the first year of the bargaining agreement and by an additional 1.5% during each of the four remaining years of a proposed five-year agreement. Under the university’s proposal, reappointed graduate employees would receive a three percent (3%) salary increase during the first year of the agreement.
Health Insurance:  The university proposed increasing the university’s contribution to the student health insurance fee for represented employees to 87%.
Fee waivers: The university is proposing the addition of language that would recognize the existing waiver of fees. 
Childcare: The university is not proposing that any language relating to child care coverage be included in the agreement. 
Duration: The university is proposing a five-year agreement.
We will continue to negotiate and work together with your labor representative, the GEO, to reach a final agreement as soon as possible. We hope that differences at the bargaining table are never interpreted as a wavering in respect for our graduate and teaching assistants.
You chose to come here to Illinois because of the opportunities available at one of the world’s leading public research universities. As students and graduate employees, you play a critical role in growing that reputation for excellence. Thank you for your dedication and particularly for your commitment to the ensuring that our undergraduate students have the kind of transformational experience we promise them when they enroll.

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This Campus Safety Notice is issued in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about crime on or immediately adjacent to their campuses to aid in the prevention of similar crimes and to assist in the identification of offenders.
This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, please visit CrimeReports.com or visit the University of Illinois Police Department to view the daily crime log.
The following burglary took place between 3-6 p.m. Saturday at Trelease Hall, 901 College Court (map), Urbana:
A U. of I. student reported that someone had entered his room while he was asleep and had taken two laptop computers. The door to the room had not been locked.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android. All messages to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of identifying information and forwarded to police by an independent third party.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Watch your belongings.Theft is the most common crime on college campuses everywhere, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is no exception. Lock up or secure your personal belongings whenever possible, even if they are sitting right next to you.
Lock your doors. The easiest way to prevent theft and burglary is by locking the door to your vehicle or residence. Criminals often will look for an open door or window to steal your items.
Bring it with you. If you’re leaving campus for an extended period of time, bring your valuables with you. During school breaks, criminals will take advantage of an empty campus.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.

We achieved a great deal in the 2013-16 plan, so this new five-year plan, “The Next 150” will build on that success.
To that end, we are engaging in a comprehensive review to update the goals outlined in the past plan and to focus our energy in several strategic areas. We are now at a critical step of seeking your comments and feedback. Please visit The Next 150 website to participate in this process and to learn more about the strategic planning work.
Several hundred people from across campus participated in goal development sessions to build on the past strategic goals. Each goal has a webpage that includes information on what emerged from those sessions. Please take some time to review these ideas and leave your feedback:

Earlier today the University was victim to a sophisticated phishing attack pretending to come from Technology Services. If you received an email with the subject line of “Information Technology Services” asking you to update your VPN credentials, please ignore and delete the message. If you need further assistance please contact the Technology Services Help Desk at 244-7000 or consult@illinois.edu.
The University’s security team immediately contained the threat.
The attack was attempted on at least 1,500 accounts, which illustrates the pervasiveness of phishing attempts and why everyone must be vigilant when using university email.
Beginning in March, Technology Services will launch an effort to further enhance email security to help better protect the university community.
In the meantime, you have the ability to take better control of your email. I encourage you to review and use the information at http://go.illinois.edu/yearofemail. There you’ll learn more about coming changes, why email is a vital tool to protect, and things to do—and not do—when using your @illnois.edu email or any email account.

As you may have heard, the Graduate Employees Organization (GEO) has issued a statement indicating that it intends to call for a strike on February 26, 2018.
We value the significant contributions made by our teaching assistants and graduate assistants to our academic mission, and we are committed to reaching a collective bargaining agreement that is fair and beneficial for all involved.
We are continuing the bargaining process and we hope we can avoid a strike. However, if a strike occurs, our top priority will be to offer the best protection for your academic experience that we can. We will take the necessary steps to minimize the disruption of instruction, to ensure your course objectives are met and to ensure timely grading. All members of the university community will be expected to meet for classes as usual. If there are interruptions, make-up arrangements must be implemented to ensure that the instructional objectives are delivered.
Full updates on the status of these negotiations as well as a list of frequently asked questions regarding the impacts of a strike can be found on the web at http://go.illinois.edu/geonegotiations.
You came to Illinois with the expectation that you would receive the quality education for which we are famous. We are committed to delivering on that promise.

We write to give you an update on two important developments in our negotiations with the Graduate Employee Organization (GEO).
Possible February 26 StrikeDuring Wednesday’s regularly scheduled session with the federal mediator, the GEO issued a statement indicating that it intends to engage in a strike beginning on February 26. We will continue bargaining in good faith and do all that we can to avoid a strike. However, if a strike occurs, our primary objective will be to offer our students the best protection we can, including minimizing the disruption of instruction, meeting course objectives and ensuring timely grading.All members of the university community will be expected to meet for classes as usual. If there are interruptions, make-up arrangements must be implemented to ensure that the instructional objectives are delivered.In the coming days we will provide you with more information and guidance about how we will continue our operations if the GEO exercises this option. Information about our policies and planning related to a possible strike can be found at: http://go.illinois.edu/geonegotiations.Thank you for your patience and assistance as we continue the negotiation process. If you have any questions, please contact the Labor and Employee Relations Office at strikequestions@illinois.edu.   
Tuition WaiversAlso, you may have heard reports following this week’s session that the university is attempting to eliminate tuition waivers in our bargaining with the GEO. These reports are not true.The university depends heavily on the use of tuition waivers to recruit and retain our graduate students. At no time in these negotiations have we ever presented – nor will we ever present – any proposal that would take away this benefit. We have underscored this point repeatedly in discussions with the GEO team during our regularly scheduled mediated sessions.The university’s proposal seeks to provide graduate students with the security of knowing their tuition waiver policies will not change while they continue to satisfactorily pursue their degree in a given program, while also allowing departments the needed flexibility to adapt and modify their graduate programs in light of changing needs and administrative models. Under that proposal, graduate students who maintain good academic standing and continue to make appropriate progress towards their degree will continue to remain eligible to receive tuition waiver-generating assistantships and will continue to receive the same rate or level of waiver throughout the time they remain in a program. 
We sincerely value the contributions made by our graduate assistants to our academic mission. We remain optimistic that we will, together, reach a collective bargaining agreement that is fair and beneficial for all involved.
Sincerely,
Robert J. Jones Chancellor

2018-02-05T13:40:00Z,2018-02-05,13:40,70180,Change in Federal Tax Withholding for Employees,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28358.html,"On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was signed into law.  TCJA is a major tax reform that has changed the tax landscape in many ways, especially, for individual tax filers.   The IRS Tables for Income Tax Withholding were restructured to the following withholding percentages:
Pre-TCJA Rates:   10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35%, and 39.6%
Post-TCJA Rates:  10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%
While the new law took effect January 1, 2018, employers have until February 15, 2018, to implement the new withholding rates due to the late release of the updated IRS Tables for Income Tax Withholding. University employees will see the impact of the new tax rates with payrolls paid on or after February 7, 2018.  There is no employer requirement to apply the new withholding rates retroactively to prior pay events.   
The IRS is also revising Form W-4, Employee’s Withholding Allowance Certificate. The revised Form W-4 will be used for employees to update their withholding in response to the TCJA or changes in their personal circumstances in 2018.  Until a new Form W-4 is issued, employees and the University will continue to use the 2017 Form W-4, as the new tax tables have been adjusted to coincide with the 2017 Form W-4.  We are waiting for the IRS to provide further clarification on the changes to the new Form W-4.  These changes may result in employees needing to complete an updated Form W-4.  Once the IRS has provided clarification to employers, we will share information about the new Form W-4 requirements.   
The Payroll and Earnings net pay calculators have been updated to reflect the TCJA changes and can help you determine how the TCJA changes affect your federal income tax withholding and your net pay.  Click the appropriate link under Calculators on the right panel to open the Monthly or Bi-Weekly Net Pay calculators. 
As always, depending upon your personal circumstances, it is possible that the amount of 2018 federal taxes you will have to pay next year, could be greater than the amount you have withheld from your pay in 2018.  Accordingly, you may want to consult with your individual tax consultant regarding your 2018 federal withholding and the impact it has on your personal tax status.

We have been informed that the Graduate Employees Organization (GEO) has served the University with an intent to strike notice today. This means that at any time on or after Friday, Feb. 9, the GEO can call for a strike without any additional notice to the University.
We were somewhat surprised and disappointed to learn of the decision at this point in the negotiations because we have a mediation session set for tomorrow, Tuesday, Jan. 30 – a meeting in which we have told the GEO negotiating team we would be prepared with counterproposals. 
We will continue to negotiate in good faith and we remain absolutely committed to reaching a resolution as soon as possible. We have made good progress with agreements reached on 12 of the 19 original proposals. A current overview of the negotiations can be found at http://go.illinois.edu/geonegotiations. There is still work and discussion to be done to reach a final contract. This means that both sides must continue to meet and conduct the meaningful dialogue necessary to find the common ground that will result in a new agreement.
We value the significant contributions our teaching assistants and graduate assistants make to our academic mission. We want to reach an agreement that is fair and beneficial for all involved.
We look forward to the next round of mediation and to the progress we will make together with the GEO negotiating team. Further, we remain committed to providing updates on the progress of mediation.

We would like to provide you with an update regarding the off-campus shooting incident described in a Community Safety Notice earlier this week. The Urbana Police Department has identified and arrested two of the people involved.
A 23-year-old man was arrested at his home off-campus in Champaign, several hours after the shooting incident Sunday morning at a house party in the 800 block of West Springfield Avenue, Urbana (map). A 22-year-old man was arrested Friday morning, also at his off-campus home in Champaign. Both men have been charged with armed robbery and aggravated battery with a firearm and remain in custody at the Champaign County Jail.
The Urbana Police Department’s investigation is ongoing. Anyone who may have been present at the house party or anyone who has video or photographs are urged to contact the Urbana Police Department at 217-384-2320. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android. All messages to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of identifying information and forwarded to police by an independent third party.
Remember that police officers are always available and willing to help if you ever feel that your safety is at risk. Please do not hesitate to call 911 to report crime or suspicious activity.
This is our community. Let's stay together.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks escort if you need one.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves.

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in an area just off campus. Although this crime does not represent a continuing threat to campus, we wanted you to be aware.
The Urbana Police Department released information this morning about a shooting which occurred around 2:04 a.m. Sunday in the 800 block of West Springfield Avenue, Urbana (map), where a large party was taking place. Investigators have determined that a group of about five people arrived to join the party. They were denied access at the door, and proceeded to rob two bystanders. One of the offenders reportedly displayed a handgun during the robbery. Several people from the house party attempted to intervene, and shots were fired by the offenders. A 21-year-old U. of I. student and a 23-year-old woman were injured during the shooting. Both women were taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The offenders ran eastbound, away from the campus area. A description of the offenders was not available.
The University of Illinois Police Department is assisting the Urbana Police Department in its investigation of this incident. Anyone who was at the house party or who has video or photographs from the party or the incident are encouraged to contact the Urbana Police Department at 217-384-2320.

For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, please visit CrimeReports.com or visit the University of Illinois Police Department to view the daily crime log.
The University of Illinois Police Department has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area, and we are fortunate to have our force supplemented by the Urbana and Champaign police departments. Between these agencies, the Urbana campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 1,700 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.

This note is a reminder that the deadline to complete the University Data Survey is January 17, 2018.  If you have not already done so, please take a few minutes to complete the survey.  The survey and more information is available at https://techservices.illinois.edu/security/universitydatasurvey. 
Details about the Survey
Technology Services’ Privacy & Security created a survey that asks employees to identify the specific types of data they access in the course of their work. We request that ALL faculty, researchers, and staff complete the “End-User Self-Reporting” survey by January 17, 2018. The survey and more information is available at https://techservices.illinois.edu/security/universitydatasurvey. 
The survey should take 5-10 minutes to complete. You only need to indicate whether you use any information in a particular category. You do not need to classify all of the pieces of data you work with.
Any questions about the survey or security in general can be directed to: securitysupport@illinois.edu.
Why are we doing this?  
The University of Illinois is committed to data privacy and information security. Last year, the Illini Secure program (https://cybersecurity.illinois.edu) was created.  This effort resulted in an updated Information Security Policy (http://cam.illinois.edu/viii/VIII-1.2.htm), a collection of IT Security Standards, an updated data classification scheme, and a new process to implement and assess IT security measures. 
For Illini Secure to be successful, we need to better understand how this data is used and where it resides.  This will allow us to allocate appropriate resources and security controls to protect the data relative to the risks it imposes. In order to ascertain this information, we are asking individuals to complete the End-User Self-Reporting Survey.
More Information
To help you better understand the relevance of the survey and ensure a better survey experience, we strongly encourage you to read the Data Classification Overview and view the videos on the Cybersecurity website at https://cybersecurity.uillinois.edu/data_classification.

The following Aggravated Assault/Battery took place around 5:40 P.M. on Monday, January 8, 2018, between the Illini Union and Altgeld Hall (map) in Urbana:
A U. of I. student walking near Altgeld Hall was approached by four male suspects who attempted to engage the student in conversation. The student continued to walk and was subsequently struck in the head by one of the suspects who was carrying a hard object in his hand.   
The offenders are described as four black males in their teens. One male suspect was wearing a red and black Chicago Blackhawks coat; a second suspect was wearing a black shirt, gray hat with a ball and sweatpants. The third suspect was wearing a dark hoodie, and the fourth suspect had a dark coat with an orange scarf.  
Information about the race or ethnicity of alleged offenders is provided only to aid detailed descriptions that include physical stature, clothing or unusual characteristics. Racial descriptions do not, by themselves, offer a meaningful picture of an individual’s appearance.
The University of Illinois Police Department is actively investigating this crime and working to obtain video of the incident. The department will issue updates when there is a significant development or further information to aid in the safety of the campus community. 
 Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216.

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Stay together.Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks  escort if you need one, or download the app for iOS or Android.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.

I am pleased to announce that our campus community raised a total of $1,354,139 during the 2017 Campus Charitable Fund Drive (CCFD) with one in five employees participating. I hope you will join me in celebrating these achievements, not merely because of the high numbers, but because this amount will have an amazing impact in supporting more than 700 community charities.
Our employees are more than individuals who work at Illinois, they are valued members of this community. Each contribution makes a significant difference to the people supported by these charitable organizations.
If you gave during this drive, I want to thank you for your generosity. Whether you made a first time gift, donate every year, or continue to participate after retirement, you are so important in this effort. I also want to thank our campaign chair, Alma R. Sealine, and the CCFD planning committee for championing this effort.
CCFD is a wonderful way that we live up to our land-grant heritage. As we continue to prioritize the community where we live and work, I look forward to more opportunities for public engagement.
Sincerely,
Robert J. Jones Chancellor"

As President Trump prepares to receive new tax reform legislation approved today by Congress, I am grateful for our combined efforts to steer the final bill away from proposals that would have been damaging to our students, our employees and our power as an engine of progress.
The University of Illinois System and our universities were vigorously engaged in recent weeks as legislators drafted changes to the tax code and then worked to reconcile differences in bills approved by the House and Senate.
Thanks to those system-wide efforts and your support, our voices added to many across the nation, and the final bill protects several key provisions of current law that help make higher education more affordable and accessible. The bill maintains the tax-free status of tuition waivers for graduate students, and preserves current deductions for interest on student loans. It also retains the Lifelong Learning Credit and the ability of universities to provide tax-free tuition assistance for employees and their dependents.
Unfortunately, the bill also includes other provisions that will increase costs for universities, and may make it more difficult to raise the private gifts that are now so crucial to support our students, our academic programs and our research. You can read more about these and other provisions here.
I hope you will stay engaged in the coming year as the U of I System continues to champion the interests of our students and our universities, both in Washington and in Springfield. My thanks again for your support, and I wish you all a peaceful and joyous holiday season.
Sincerely,
Tim"

Technology Services’ Privacy & Security created a survey that asks employees to identify the specific types of data they access in the course of their work. We request that ALL faculty, researchers, and staff complete the “End-User Self-Reporting” survey by January 17, 2018. The survey and more information is available at https://techservices.illinois.edu/security/universitydatasurvey. 
The survey should take 5-10 minutes to complete. You only need to indicate whether you use any information in a particular category. You do not need to classify all of the pieces of data you work with.
Any questions about the survey or security in general can be directed to: securitysupport@illinois.edu.
Why are we doing this?  
The University of Illinois is committed to data privacy and information security. Last year, the Illini Secure program (https://cybersecurity.illinois.edu) was created.  This effort resulted in an updated Information Security Policy (http://cam.illinois.edu/viii/VIII-1.2.htm), a collection of IT Security Standards, an updated data classification scheme, and a new process to implement and assess IT security measures. 
For Illini Secure to be successful, we need to better understand how this data is used and where it resides.  This will allow us to allocate appropriate resources and security controls to protect the data relative to the risks it imposes. In order to ascertain this information, we are asking individuals to complete the End-User Self-Reporting Survey.

Dear faculty, staff and students:
Today, a set of guiding principles were posted on our website that lay out where the University of Illinois System stands on three important issues that have been front-and-center nationally in recent months, including on college campuses.
The news release below will be sent to the media later this morning, announcing the principles that will be our guide through challenges involving free speech on campus, globalization and immigration, and instilling the civic-minded spirit that our graduates take with them to help lift their communities.
As the news release explains, these principles address those current, hot-button issues through a broad framework rooted in current practices. They are a touchstone to guide our future, not a policy that spells out a response to every scenario we might face. They also are living documents that will be augmented and adjusted as needed to accommodate change, or to incorporate new issues affecting other core values that guide us.
I am proud of the collaborative process behind this initiative, which began during a July retreat hosted by the Board of Trustees. Since the beginning, it has brought together more than 200 faculty, staff, students and other stakeholders from across the system to distill these complex issues into a clear path forward that is rooted in the bedrock values of our past.
My deepest thanks to everyone who shared their talents to craft a vision that reflects our land-grant mission and reaffirms our unwavering commitment to serve the needs of students and the public good.
Sincerely,
Tim
 
U of I System releases set of guiding principles Collaborative initiative lays out system’s stand on key national issues
URBANA, Ill. – The University of Illinois System released a set of guiding principles today that lay out its position on three pressing academic and campus culture issues currently facing higher education across the country, President Tim Killeen announced.
The concise statements, developed through extensive collaborations over the last five months with key stakeholders, address free speech on campus, globalization and immigration, and civic engagement. They were posted today on the U of I System’s website and shared with faculty, staff and students at its three universities through an email.
Killeen said the statements respond to those current and frequently controversial national issues by reaffirming core values that have carried the system from its founding to its place as a global pioneer in education and discovery. 
“These guiding principles will help ensure that our universities continue to foster an inclusive, welcoming campus climate that promotes an open exchange of divergent ideas and develops new generations of leaders,” he said.
Killeen said the statements align with current practices and, by design, are not intended as a comprehensive view that addresses every possible scenario that could arise on campuses from these complex issues. Instead, he said, they codify the broad principles that have guided the system’s success in the past, providing a solid foundation that will inform its actions in the future.
He also said the statements are “living documents” that can be adapted as needed to address change, or to incorporate new, pressing issues involving other principles that guide the U of I System’s missions of education, research, public engagement and economic development.
Work to develop the statements began at a July retreat hosted by the U of I Board of Trustees that focused on three timely issues in higher education – free speech on campus, immigration and globalization, and civic engagement.
More than 100 people participated in the daylong retreat, which brought national experts on those subjects together with trustees, faculty, staff, students and leadership from the three universities and system offices.
Afterward, Killeen appointed working groups to distill the ideas that surfaced during the retreat and then draft statements, which were later finalized through input from students, faculty, chancellors and other stakeholders. From start to finish, he said, more than 200 people across the system were involved in the process.
Here are excerpts from the statements:
Freedom of speech on campus. The statement reaffirms the system’s “unyielding allegiance” to free speech and the power that “even controversial, contentious, and unpopular speech” holds to create active and informed citizens.  But academic excellence also requires an environment of mutual respect, and the system will “vigorously and even-handedly protect … against conduct that falls outside the First Amendment” to ensure a safe and robust exchange of viewpoints, the statement says.
Globalization and immigration. The statement recommits to welcoming, diverse campus cultures that reflect the increasing globalization that now exists for today’s students, alumni, faculty and staff. “Formal and informal engagement with the broader world – in traditional or virtual classrooms … in residence halls, even in a line for coffee – brings energy, distinction, and a sense of common purpose to all the work we do,"" the statement says.
Civic engagement. The statement commits to build on a long legacy of producing well-rounded, civic-minded graduates whose collective talents serve the needs of progress and the public good. “Just as our faculty and staff bridge spaces between disciplines to produce scholarship with societal value, we aim to produce graduates with the skills, values, and experiences to be truly engaged in their communities,"" the statement says.
###
The University of Illinois System is a world leader in research and discovery, and the largest educational institution in the state with more than 83,000 students, nearly 25,000 faculty and staff, and universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield. The U of I awards nearly 22,000 undergraduate, graduate and professional degrees annually."

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes on or immediately adjacent to campus property. 
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes. We are not including certain details in this alert so as to avoid releasing identifying information about the victim.
The University of Illinois Police Department has received a report that a student was sexually assaulted. A suspect has been identified and police are continuing to investigate.  A Campus Security Authority later notified the Department that there was a similar attempt at the same event.  These happened at 8:45 p.m. Saturday, December 2, 2017 at Foellinger Auditorium, 709 S. Mathews, map, in Urbana. The offender, who was unknown to the victims, was described by both as a white male with brown hair, wearing a hockey jersey.  It is unknown at this time if the same offender identified in the police report is the same offender reported to the Campus Security Authority.
Information about the race or ethnicity of alleged offenders is provided only to aid detailed descriptions that include physical stature, clothing or unusual characteristics. Racial descriptions do not, by themselves, offer a meaningful picture of an individual’s appearance.
The University Police is sending this notice in case there are other survivors involved who would like to report the incident.  We will issue updates via mass email if there are significant developments.  Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android. All messages to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of identifying information and forwarded to police by an independent third party.
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.
If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another person, intervene if it’s safe to do so or call for assistance.
While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. The university, community organizations and local law enforcement offer a number of reporting options.
Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.
It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This Campus Safety Notice is issued in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about crime to aid in the prevention of similar crimes and to assist in the identification of offenders.
This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, please visit CrimeReports.com or visit the University of Illinois Police Department to view the daily crime log.
The following burglary took place at 6 a.m. Saturday, Nov. 18, at an apartment in the 1800 block of South Orchard Street, Urbana (map):
A U. of I. student reported that someone had entered his apartment without permission and stood near the bed while he was sleeping. The person left the apartment when the student awoke. The student was unable to give a complete description of the suspect. It was reported that the apartment was locked, and there was no sign of forced entry. Nothing was reported stolen.
The University of Illinois Police Department has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area, and we are fortunate to have our force supplemented by the Urbana and Champaign police departments. Between these agencies, the Urbana campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 1,700 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android. All messages to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of identifying information and forwarded to police by an independent third party.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Watch your belongings. Theft is the most common crime on college campuses everywhere, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is no exception. Lock up or secure your personal belongings whenever possible, even if they are sitting right next to you.
Lock your doors. The easiest way to prevent theft and burglary is by locking the door to your vehicle or residence. Criminals often will look for an open door or window to steal your items.
Bring it with you. If you’re leaving campus for an extended period of time, bring your valuables with you. During school breaks, criminals will take advantage of an empty campus.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.

2017-11-17T09:08:00Z,2017-11-17,9:8,17664,Chief of Police Jeff Christensen will retire on December 31,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28295.html,"Dear Colleagues,
I write to let you know that University of Illinois Police Chief Jeff Christensen will be retiring from university service on December 31. He’s chosen to make the announcement now to allow us plenty of time to ensure there is no disruption of the departmental efforts to protect the safety of our community. Beginning on January 1, 2018, Deputy Chief Matt Myrick will become the interim chief of police, pending approval by the Board of Trustees.
It has been a long time since this campus has known what it is like to be without Jeff Christensen watching out for its safety. He started his public safety career here in 1983 as a volunteer member of the student patrol while working toward his sociology degree. From there to patrol officer to deputy chief and finally to his 2012 appointment as chief of police and executive director of public safety, Jeff has been protecting students, faculty, staff and visitors here for more than three decades. But he hasn’t simply risen up through the ranks of the UIPD. He has elevated the performance of those around him at every step of the way.
He has built a team that has earned the University of Illinois Police Department a reputation for its integrity and for its community-focused approach to public safety and law enforcement. In just my first year here at Illinois, I have watched again and again as he and his team offer the first shoulder of support to individuals and families who are suddenly facing unthinkable tragedy and loss. That is how you build trust and how you create a police force that is a true partner with the community it serves. This is no accident. It is a conscious and committed leadership decision that Jeff has personally exemplified and professionally demanded of those who serve with him.
It is often traditional in messages like these to express mixed feelings on the departure of a respected and well-known colleague. This is not one of those messages and there are no mixed feelings today. There is only a deep sense of gratitude to Jeff for his service and heartfelt congratulations from our entire community on a job so very well done here at Illinois.
In these last few weeks of his Illinois career, I hope you’ll reach out to Jeff directly and offer your own best wishes as he and his family start their next adventure.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

Dear colleagues:
I am pleased to announce that Professor Adriana Crocker of the University of Illinois at Springfield will serve as our newest Presidential Fellow. Professor Crocker is an award-winning teacher who specializes in Latin American politics, with a strong background in international law and women’s rights, and will work to help the U of I System expand its global reach. 
As a Presidential Fellow, Professor Crocker will work with faculty across the System to promote international student exchanges and research partnerships. She is particularly interested in forging new alliances with global universities that will help reimagine student-focused teaching and learning and make the U of I System one of the world’s most sought-after destinations for both students and scholars.
Professor Crocker, who joined the UIS faculty in 2006, is a professor of political science and teaches comparative politics and international relations courses with an emphasis on Latin American politics.  In 2016, she received the distinguished Pearson Faculty Award, which recognizes a faculty member whose performance exemplifies UIS’s commitment to excellence in teaching and who stands among the very best teachers on campus. Her research focuses on the role of gender quotas and other institutional mechanisms in serving the interests of women in Latin America. She has a law degree from the University of La Plata Argentina and a Ph.D. from Northern Illinois University. 
The Presidential Fellows Program was created to tap into the deep pool of faculty talent at our three universities to help foster initiatives that guide us toward the goals of our Strategic Framework and expand our system-wide service to students and the public good. 
I am grateful to Professor Crocker for sharing her talents, and hope you will join me in welcoming her to this new, important role.
Sincerely,
Tim"

I am pleased to name Andreas Cangellaris, dean of the College of Engineering and the M.E. Van Valkenburg Professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering, as the vice chancellor for academic affairs and provost designate. His appointment in the new role will be effective on Jan. 16, pending approval by the Board of Trustees.
Dean Cangellaris has earned an international reputation for excellence as an academic leader, a teacher and a researcher. His career here at Illinois has provided him with vast institutional knowledge and deep personal connections with faculty members, staff and students. This combination set him apart from the rest of a very deep pool of candidates and made him the clear choice to fill this critical leadership position.
I want to thank the search committee, chaired by College of Law Dean Vikram Amar, for its careful work in recruiting and evaluating an outstanding selection of applicants and in guiding the search process over the past months. I also want to express my gratitude to each of you in the campus community who offered advice and honest feedback about the final candidates.
Dean Cangellaris has provided critical campus leadership at Illinois around a number of major interdisciplinary initiatives and programs. He was among the core group of faculty and administrators who developed the vision that has led to the new Carle Illinois College of Medicine. He was among the initial collaborators in laying the groundwork and securing the private gift for the Siebel Center for Design that will break ground in the spring of 2018. Dean Cangellaris has been instrumental in developing new research, educational and engagement partnerships that range from Chicago to Singapore to mainland China.
Dean Cangellaris has led the College of Engineering since August 2013. Prior to that, he served as the head of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. He is internationally recognized for his research in applied and computational electromagnetics and its applications to the signal integrity of integrated electronic circuits and systems. Dean Cangellaris’ research has produced several design methods and computer tools that are used widely in the microelectronics industry. He is a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. He has received a Humboldt Research Award and the U.S. Army Research Laboratory Director's Coin.
I will be working in consultation with Dean Cangellaris, the engineering leadership team and faculty members along with my leadership team to select an interim dean for the College in the coming weeks.
I want to express my deep appreciation to John Wilkin for his leadership as interim vice chancellor for academic affairs and provost. His collaborative and consultative approach has brought stability and strong leadership to the role while the campus searched for a permanent provost. He has been a strong and thoughtful leader throughout this transition.
Please join me in congratulating Dean Cangellaris and in welcoming him to his new role at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Sincerely,
Robert J. Jones Chancellor"

To protect victims’ privacy, we generally do not include specific details about exact locations or times to avoid releasing information that could lead to the identification of a survivor and cause further harm to that person.
A Campus Security Authority informed the University of Illinois Police Department on Wednesday, Nov. 8, that a student had been touched inappropriately Sept. 20 at a university residence hall. The alleged offender, who is a U. of I. student, is the same person named in two previously reported instances of inappropriate behavior and lewd comments directed toward other people. While the two previous incidents did not meet the state’s legal definition of sexual abuse, we feel it is important information to disclose to the campus community.
You are receiving this notice because the alleged offender had been jailed in Will County, Illinois, for an unrelated incident but has recently been released and is expected to return to campus. We are unable to name the alleged offender at this time because he has not been charged with a crime related to the offenses detailed in this notice.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to those involved and taking steps to prevent similar incidents involving the same offender. Although criminal charges have not been filed, student disciplinary proceedings may take place.

Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.
It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves.

 On October 25th, students with indigenous backgrounds, Native American House staff, and alumni came to Illinois Student Government detailing the harm caused by the continued use of the Chief in University-sponsored events, particularly in the Homecoming Parade. After listening to our peers, we issued a resolution taking a stand against cultural appropriation by boycotting the parade. As student leaders, we understand that progress requires continuous effort. We will continue to fight for a truly inclusive campus by elevating the voices of our indigenous students and allies, coordinating with our campus partners, and lobbying the administration to take appropriate action.
October is not just for Homecoming though. It also brings Halloween, and with it more inappropriate representations of cultures and minorities. These representations range from students in blackface to ""tacos and tequila"" themed parties. This year, we would like to give you some tips to make sure you're respecting everyone at Illinois:
Avoid costumes that play into cultural stereotypes, especially when it’s not your own culture.
Avoid accessories that could be described as ""tribal"" or ""ethnic”, such as Native American headdresses or sombreros.
Be cautious of making light of struggles faced by other minority groups, such as deportation, genocide, and sexual assault.
Remember that struggles such as homelessness or mental illness are harsh realities for many, not costumes to be taken on and off at will.
 If you are questioning whether your costume is offensive, it may be best not to wear it. We also encourage those hosting themed parties throughout the year to consider these tips. Remember, although you may think it's just a costume or that you're exercising your right to freedom of expression, to many people it's a trivialization of their culture. 
Have a safe, respectful, and responsible weekend!
In Orange and Blue,

Today we publicly announced a new partnership between the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the University of Chicago dedicated to technology development for some of society’s most pressing challenges, from producing clean water to treating cancer. This new partnership for innovation will combine our collective world-class excellence in advanced analytics and advanced materials and give our university a greatly enhanced presence in the Chicagoland area.
The partnership will bring 100 faculty, researchers and students from Urbana-Champaign to collaborate with University of Chicago colleagues, entrepreneurs and industry leaders, and will be based in a new innovation complex in Hyde Park on Chicago’s South Side. Its primary goal will be developing and commercializing groundbreaking technology, driving the formation of startup companies and other links to industry. University of Chicago’s Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, which helps innovators commercialize ideas and technologies and fosters the creation of new businesses, will lead the partnership.
As the Illinois land-grant university, we have an obligation and mission to serve the citizens of our state by providing access to education and by translating knowledge into practical improvements for the way people live and work. For us to fully deliver on that promise we need to be actively engaged in the areas where the people of this state are concentrated and where we can create the greatest impact with the greatest speed. In Illinois, that means you need to have a presence in Chicago. And while we may only be a couple of hours away, sometimes that small gap on the map becomes an impassable barrier. This partnership just made that barrier a lot less daunting.
More importantly, this program is a win for the entire state of Illinois to have its flagship university so deeply engaged in the civic and economic life of the city of Chicago.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

This morning, I had the privilege of joining Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner to announce that the University of Illinois System will lead an exciting new initiative that will help drive waves of innovation, entrepreneurship and economic growth across Illinois and provide wonderful opportunities for our students and faculty.
The news release below outlines plans for the new Discovery Partners Institute (DPI), a world-class generator of new ideas and new businesses that will be developed in Chicago and then spread its impact across Illinois through a statewide enterprise known as the Illinois Innovation Network (IIN).
All of you share the credit for attracting these new jewels. We were entrusted to lead this important new public-private partnership thanks to a rich legacy of discovery by you and the generations before you that has made the U of I System a world-renowned destination for pioneering innovation.
You also will play a central role in launching and supporting the new initiatives. We will rely heavily on your expertise and insights to help develop programming and forge new partnerships, and we welcome all who are interested to share their talents to help tackle the critical global challenges that will find solutions at DPI and IIN.
I am deeply grateful to the governor for his confidence, to Chicago-based Related Midwest for donating the land that will be home to the institute, and to all of you for positioning the U of I System to continue to lead the way to a new era of progress and prosperity.
Sincerely,

Rauner announces new initiative targeting innovation, economic growthU of I System to lead Chicago-based center, which will serve entire state
October 19, 2017
CHICAGO – The University of Illinois System will lead a new research institute that will be developed on a donated site in downtown Chicago where world-class researchers will work side-by-side with students and businesses to foster next-generation innovation and workforce development, Gov. Bruce Rauner announced Thursday.
Plans for the Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) were outlined by Rauner and U of I President Tim Killeen during an event at the site donated by Chicago-based Related Midwest. The site is part of The 78, a 62-acre tract owned by Related Midwest that borders the Chicago River at Clark Street and Roosevelt Road. The 78 is the largest development of its kind in downtown Chicago, and also will include a mix of residential, office, retail, recreational and cultural space adjacent to a half-mile river walk.
The gift will kick off work on an implementation plan that will be completed next year. The plan will include a timetable for opening and other details of the $1.2 billion institute, which will be operated principally through private donations and partnerships with business and industry. DPI hopes to attract government support as well.
The institute is the inaugural step in the development of the Illinois Innovation Network (IIN), an initiative to spread DPI’s impact across the state that also was announced by the governor Thursday.
“This unique new institute will add to the momentum that has been developing in Chicago to create an innovation infrastructure at the kind of scale that can massively accelerate progress and economic development in our state,” Killeen said. “It will build on the U of I System’s long, rich history of pioneering innovation, and a legacy of service to Illinois and to this global city that dates back more than a century.”
“DPI is a way for our state to harness its considerable research, computing and commercial resources to create economic opportunity all across Illinois,” Rauner said. “Combining research and development resources – from Carbondale to Chicago – and linking them with sources of capital will produce unparalleled growth for Illinois. IIN and DPI will become a magnet for talent and innovation for generations to come.”
DPI will connect top research faculty in agriculture, healthcare, computing and other critical fields with hundreds of businesses and thousands of students over time, as well as with entrepreneurs and venture capital firms. Their research and educational collaborations will address real-world challenges, promoting the kind of breakthrough discoveries that create new products and companies, while also providing hands-on experiences for students and nurturing a skilled workforce for the city and state.
“This campus for innovation, anchored by the University of Illinois, will be a transformative force on the South Side of Chicago and for all of Chicago,” Emanuel said. “I look forward to working with the governor and the many partners involved as we turn this vision into a reality.”
Along with serving Chicago, the institute ultimately will become the centerpiece of IIN, a virtually connected statewide enterprise allowing DPI staff to work with university and business partners in other regions across the state on research and education initiatives that help launch new companies and lift communities.
“This new institute capitalizes on the strengths of a university system already recognized around the world as a leader in education and discovery,” Killeen said. “It will put the U of I and our partners at the forefront of a dynamic model of higher education in our knowledge-based, 21st century economy – one designed to serve both our students and the public good.”
He said DPI and IIN will also benefit the System’s universities in Chicago, Springfield and Urbana-Champaign, and expand their impact across the state. Among other benefits, he said, the initiatives will provide hands-on opportunities for students to spend one to four semesters working with DPI researchers and Chicago-based businesses, provide new opportunities for university-based faculties to collaborate in leading-edge research, and expand faculty opportunities to engage with industry partners and attract venture capital.
Killeen said Chicago was chosen as the home of the institute and catalyst for the statewide innovation network because of its role as an economic engine for the Midwest and its place as a global destination that attracts talent from around the world. 
The University of Chicago and Northwestern University have joined the U of I as inaugural partners in DPI, he said, and additional member institutions are anticipated. He said DPI will add to an innovation infrastructure that has grown in Chicago through incubators such as 1871, MATTER and mHUB.
Planning for DPI and IIN have been underway for more than a year by a team led by U of I Vice President for Economic Development and Innovation Edward Seidel, Chancellor Robert Jones of the U of I at Urbana-Champaign, Chancellor Michael Amiridis of the U of I at Chicago, Chancellor Susan Koch of U of I at Springfield, and others.
The institute will open initially with up to 50 faculty, and expand to as many as 90 new faculty when DPI reaches full operation. Institute faculty will hold faculty appointments at one of the U of I System’s three universities or at the other partner universities. Current U of I faculty also will be involved with the institute, helping to develop programming and engaging in interdisciplinary research and education in concert with their home institutions.
“Our world-class faculty are a critical component of DPI, helping set the vision, the scale and the commitment to pioneering collaboration with our business partners that will attract top talent from around the world, drive innovation and strengthen the economic vitality of the state of Illinois,” Jones said. 
DPI will initially serve several hundred students a year who are enrolled at the U of I and partner universities, growing to about 1,800 at full operation. The institute will engage both graduate and undergraduate students, who will spend one to four semesters living in Chicago while working at DPI and at businesses and startups in the city.
The residential aspect will also benefit Chicago, supporting an estimated $300 million in private real estate development to house students and faculty, Killeen said. It also will provide long-term benefits, he said, giving students first-hand exposure to the city that will encourage them to stay after they graduate.
“An innovation ecosystem such as the Discovery Partners Institute has the potential to provide outstanding collaborative research and educational opportunities for UIC students and build upon the upward trajectory of global scientific discovery that takes place in Chicago and Illinois,” Amiridis said.
Killeen said DPI’s world-class faculty could attract up to $500 million annually in research funding.
DPI research will initially include a focus on advances in “big data” and computing technology, from cybersecurity to the internet of things; in healthcare, including new drugs and treatment methods such as telehealth; and in food and agriculture breakthroughs to improve nutrition and help feed a growing world.
DPI also will help stem an outflow of Illinois university graduates to employment opportunities in other states, Killeen said. Research discovery from the institute will generate startup companies that will expand Chicago-area job prospects, he said, and at full operation DPI will serve up to 10,000 students every five years whose education includes direct exposure to businesses in the city.
“The University of Illinois at Springfield is on an exciting growth trajectory and the new Discovery Partners Institute in Chicago will offer a terrific opportunity for UIS students to gain experience in an environment focused on innovation and collaboration,” Koch said. “Every UIS student is a potential economic engine for our state and the institute will encourage talented students to remain in Illinois to pursue their careers and become valuable assets for their communities.”
Curt Bailey, president of Related Midwest, said DPI’s focus on research, education and innovation match the company’s development plans for The 78.
“This transformative downtown neighborhood will be curated to offer the best of Chicago and designed to respond to the rapidly changing demands of future generations, which makes it an ideal location for a dynamic institute like DPI,” he said. “Related Midwest is committed to supporting Illinois’ vibrant tech community and thrilled to collaborate with the University of Illinois System, the University of Chicago and Northwestern University to invest in the next great innovation and entrepreneurship hub.”
According to Killeen, DPI’s impact could grow if faculty and enrollment increase through ongoing fundraising efforts.

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes on or immediately adjacent to campus property.
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes. We are not including certain details in this alert so as to avoid releasing identifying information about the victim.
On Wednesday morning, the University of Illinois Police Department was informed by a Campus Security Authority that a student had inappropriately touched three other students on different occasions, at least two of which occurred at a university residence hall. The offender is a person known to the victims.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to assist those involved in this incident and will continue to take actions to maintain the safety and security of the campus community.
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.

Professor Martinis has earned a reputation here at Illinois as a collaborative scholar and consultative leader who gets serious work done. These qualities make her an ideal fit for this role.
Professor Martinis joined the department of biochemistry at Illinois as an associate professor in 2005 and became a full professor in 2009. Her tenure at Illinois has included service as head of biochemistry as well as a term as an associate dean for LAS. She also served as head of the department of medical biochemistry for the Regional College of Medicine’s operation on the Urbana campus. Her research into the mechanisms, evolution and biomedical applications of protein synthesis and RNA-protein interactions has been supported by NIH and NSF and earned her recognition as a University Scholar. She also has significant experience in the private sector, working to launch the lifesaving antibiotic Cubicin while at Cubist Pharmaceuticals (acquired by Merck in 2014). Professor Martinis earned her Ph.D. in biochemistry here at Illinois and trained at MIT as an American Cancer Society Postdoctoral Fellow. She currently holds the Stephen G. Sligar Professorship in the School of Molecular and Cellular Biology.  
I want to thank Peter Schiffer for his outstanding service and leadership as vice chancellor at Illinois. He leaves us with a research enterprise and infrastructure that is robust, resilient, sustainable and positioned for continued growth and excellence.
Please join me in congratulating – and thanking – Professor Susan Martinis as she takes on this critical responsibility for us. I am confident that the research enterprise will not only continue to thrive, but also grow under her leadership.
Sincerely,
Robert J. Jones Chancellor"

We would like to provide you with updated information regarding crimes described in a Campus Safety Notice issued on Monday.
The University of Illinois Police Department has arrested a student who was identified as the offender in two incidents of sexual violence that took place Aug. 25 and Sept. 16. The student was in custody Thursday at the Champaign County Jail and is awaiting arraignment. For more information about the arrest, visit the University of Illinois Police Department website: https://illinois.edu/blog/view/6221/557937.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to assist those involved in these incidents and will continue to take actions to maintain the safety and security of the campus community.
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.
If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another person, intervene if it’s safe to do so or call for assistance.
While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. The university, community organizations and local law enforcement offer a number of reporting options.
Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.
It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.

In order to maintain an effective emergency response and evacuation plan, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign recently completed a test including two components: a drill and an exercise. The test was designed to challenge our emergency response procedures and how we notify you of a threat to our campus community.
On Sept. 5, we initiated a test of our Illini-Alert emergency notification system. The drill was announced ahead of time by a mass email to campus and an Eweek notice to faculty and staff. The Illini-Alert system sent an email to the campus email addresses of all active faculty, staff and students. Those who have registered alternate email addresses also received a notification. Those who have registered a cellphone number were sent a text message during this drill.
Illini-Alert messages are also posted to Facebook and Twitter and on campus websites through our Emergency Web Alert System. This approach increases the speed and breadth of our distribution of emergency notifications, and it provides a robust communication engine that will continue to function successfully even if one system fails to work properly.
For the second component, university personnel and emergency responders from a number of local agencies gathered for a functional exercise on Sept. 19 from 8 a.m. to noon at the Illinois Fire Service Institute. The exercise was announced in an Eweek notice to faculty and staff, and those involved were presented with a scenario involving a natural disaster that directly affected campus. The exercise tested various components of the Campus Emergency Operations Plan, including evacuation procedures.
This test was conducted to ensure we have a robust response plan in the event of a campus emergency, and that our emergency notifications will reach you in a timely and effective manner. If you have not signed up to receive emergency messages through Illini-Alert, please visit http://emergency.illinois.edu/ to register.
To view the University’s emergency response and evacuation procedures, please visit http://go.illinois.edu/EmergencyResponse.
The University of Illinois Police Department is committed to maintaining a safe and secure campus environment where education, research and public service can flourish. We can only do so with the assistance of our community, and we hope this information is useful to all of our campus partners.

Lieutenant Todd ShortUniversity of Illinois Police DepartmentOffice of Campus Emergency Management"

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes.
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes. We are not including certain details in this alert so as to avoid releasing identifying information about the victim.
On Sunday night, a Campus Security Authority reported to the University of Illinois Police Department that one student was sexually assaulted and another student was sexually abused in two separate incidents on August 25, 2017, and September 16, 2017, by a single offender known to the victims in a university residence hall.

I am pleased to announce the kickoff of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 2017 Campus Charitable Fund Drive (CCFD), our workplace giving campaign, which will take place this year from September 18, 2017 to November 10, 2017.
The campaign is an opportunity for our Illinois faculty and staff to give to charities that support the communities where we work and live. In previous years, over 3,000 faculty and staff have pledged more than $1 million to more than 700 charities. Even in my brief time at Illinois, it has been amazing to see the generosity of the people who work at this great university.
In honor of the University of Illinois’s sesquicentennial celebration, our university-wide goal is to raise $1.5 million this year. Help us make this goal a reality by encouraging your fellow colleagues to participate. Every dollar impacts the services and resources available to our community and makes a difference.
Illinois faculty and staff members can safely and easily donate to the charities of their choosing through payroll deduction or personal check. Please explore the CCFD website to learn more about our campaign and the charities that are important to you.
I also want to thank the faculty and staff volunteers who help make CCFD possible. They play an invaluable role in making this positive impact on our community. If you have any questions during the campaign, please feel free to reach out to your college or department’s volunteer leaders.

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This Campus Safety Notice is issued in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about crime to aid in the prevention of similar crimes and to assist in the identification of offenders.
This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, please visit CrimeReports.com or visit the University of Illinois Police Department to view the daily crime log.
The following burglary took place between 1-10 a.m. Tuesday, Sept. 12, at Oglesby Hall, 1005 W. College Court (map), in Urbana, and was reported Wednesday evening:
A U. of I. student reported that a wallet was stolen from a residence hall room. According to the report, the student was sleeping in the room at the time of the burglary, and the door was locked. No information about the offender was provided.
The University of Illinois Police Department has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area, and we are fortunate to have our force supplemented by the Urbana and Champaign police departments. Between these agencies, the Urbana campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 1,600 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android. All messages to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of identifying information and forwarded to police by an independent third party.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Watch your stuff. Theft is the most common crime on college campuses everywhere, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is no exception. Lock up or secure your personal belongings whenever possible. Never leave valuables unattended, even if you will be gone only for a moment.
Lock your doors. The easiest way to prevent theft and burglary is by locking the door to your vehicle or residence. Criminals often will look for an open door or window to steal your items.
Bring it with you. If you’re leaving campus for an extended period of time, bring your valuables with you. During school breaks, criminals will take advantage of an empty campus.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.

Earlier today you received a Massmail signed by President Killeen, Executive Vice President Wilson and the chancellors of our three universities about the United States Department of Justice announcement ending the Deferred Action of Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in the coming months. We are carefully reviewing the implications of this action for our students. We remain committed to the principles set out in the campus statement in support of DACA and students sent on December 13, 2016.
Commitment to Remaining an Inclusive and Supportive CampusAt the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, our preeminence in research, teaching and public engagement has long depended on keeping our doors wide open to the most talented students, faculty and staff from all over the United States and abroad. We recruit and support the very best regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion or national origin.We will be proactive in supporting all of our students, faculty, staff and visiting scholars, whether domestic or international. We will advocate for the continued access of undocumented and DACA students to full educational opportunities. We will build a campus culture of inclusion to ensure all members of our community may pursue their educational and professional goals not only free from acts of discrimination and intolerance, but in the full knowledge they are welcomed and embraced. As always, we will protect student and employee confidential information to the fullest extent allowed by law. While we will comply with all federal, state and local laws, we will also champion laws and regulations that recognize how critical immigrant students and scholars are to the excellence of our great research university and the continued world-leading achievement of the United States in science, engineering, humanities, social science and the arts.As a leading land grant university, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign remains steadfast in its mission to educate, research and engage, and thereby change the world for the better. Our success rests firmly on the principle of inviting the best and brightest into our community and supporting their capacity to thrive, and we will vigorously advocate for actions, laws and policies that protect and advance that principle.
Thank you to all of the members of our community for your efforts to help us create an inclusive and supportive university. Information about campus policies and resources related to DACA can be found at http://open.illinois.edu.

Dear students, faculty and staff:
Today, the Trump administration announced it is rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy, with a six-month wind-down that would give Congress time to preserve it in some form. According to the announcement, no new applications will be accepted under the program, but those currently enrolled may maintain their DACA status until their permits expire.
As a public university system, we will always comply with all federal, state and local laws. However, our values as a land-grant institution compel us to speak out when government action puts members of our own communities at risk.
The elimination of DACA is inconsistent with our commitment to accessible and high-quality education for all qualified and deserving students. We know the announcement creates uncertainty for some of our current students and long-term threats if Congress fails to act. We pledge to assist and support our students throughout the process, and we will continue to protect confidential student and employee information to the fullest extent allowed by law.
We are working in conjunction with the American Council on Education (ACE) and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU) to make our concerns known at the national level. And we are engaged in conversations with our Illinois Congressional delegation as they consider possible legislative responses.
We join our peer institutions around the state and across the nation in calling for policies and laws that continue to provide access to educational opportunities for undocumented and DACA students.

One of the special privileges enjoyed by me as chancellor at Illinois is welcoming all of you to the start of this new academic year. This week we will see our streets – despite a few unexpected construction delays – and residence halls and buildings filled again with our full contingent of students, faculty and staff. Whether this is your first experience at Illinois or another annual return, it is great to have you here. The personalities, ideas and excitement of our people are what make the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign the special place it is.
As I told more than 7,000 of our most recent arrivals at Friday’s New Student Convocation, we are in this together as a community. All of us have come to this one place at this one point in time. And this year at Illinois – our Sesquicentennial year – will be remembered by what we choose to do here together.
We are all part of a widely and wonderfully diverse university family. We come from more than 100 nations, we practice different religions, we bring different cultural practices, and we carry differing ideas and opinions on virtually every issue imaginable. One look through our history shows that this range of viewpoints, which is for the most part a healthy thing, has sometimes generated intense disagreement and even personal animosity.
But for 150 years now, the University of Illinois has been a place that strives, usually with great success, to bring this wealth of perspectives together in constructive ways that lead to discoveries, ideas and innovations that touch and improve every life on this planet. Of our many traditions, this is the one in which I believe we should take the most pride, and the one that I feel offers us the strongest inspiration for the choices we will make in our careers and lives.
I, with my leadership team, am committed to making this campus an easy and productive place for you to live, teach, discover and learn. I have no idea what shape these experiences will take and it is impossible to predict where they might lead. That’s up to all of you. But I know it is going to be enormously rewarding, exciting – and fun – to be a part of it.
Welcome to the new year at Illinois and I wish you all the best.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

The emails involved in this attack included attachments that pretended to either be a payment receipt or a fax message. In reality, both attachments were malware. If the attachments were opened they infected Windows computers. In many cases, the emails appeared to be sent from University of Illinois email accounts. 
If you opened either of these email attachments, Technology Services encourages you to run anti-malware software to confirm that your computer is not infected, and then update your passwords. 
If you need further assistance, you can contact your local IT professional, contact the Technology Services Help Desk (217-244-7000 or consult@illinois.edu), or visit the Technology Services website for more information about this attack.
Technology Services has taken technical measures to make sure this particular phishing attack does not spread any further. 
Phishing attacks are a constant threat to our university. While Technology Services blocks millions of phishing emails from being delivered every day, no technical solution is foolproof. Therefore, it is important for everyone to be vigilant and aware of these kinds of threats. Do not open suspicious emails and email attachments, even if they arrive from names that you recognize. Simply delete suspicious messages.

The week before we welcome our faculty, staff and students back for a new academic year should be a time of anticipation and optimism here at Illinois, but that enthusiasm is tempered by the events in Charlottesville, Virginia, that began with anger and ended in death. Episodes like these remind us of the real human costs of hate, racial bigotry and violence masquerading as civil discourse.
Nighttime, torch-bearing parades and displays of Nazi flags and paraphernalia can only be meant to intimidate, threaten and antagonize. These are the same symbols used just a few generations ago by a movement that murdered millions of people based on their race, sexual orientation, religion and ideology.
The First Amendment assures the right of free speech. But some speech must be condemned as an affront to our values. We cannot afford to ignore the violence such speech produces nor the damage it does to individuals and communities. We adamantly reject the idea of racial supremacy, and we extend our deep sympathy and wishes for healing to the community of Charlottesville.
At the same time, we must take this opportunity to commit ourselves as members of the Illinois community to finding peaceful and effective ways to debate, discuss and argue about divisive issues here at home. We will be defined as a university and a community by how we conduct ourselves in moments like this.
Intolerance, racism and violence are destructive to any democratic society, and they will never be condoned here at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The lens of history gives us many reminders of the massive human toll taken when hatred and bigotry rear their ugly heads and go unchallenged, or – through wicked intimidation – infect and persist within society. The same history, however, also gives us many examples of heroic and principled efforts to build and sustain human progress – achieved through the inspiring bravery and resolve of many in generations before. A recent visit to the American cemetery near Omaha Beach brought this home to one of us very recently.
Over the weekend, hate-fueled violence initiated and carried out by modern-day representatives of groups associated with the evil ideas of white supremacy, KKK, neo-Nazism and anti-Semitism led to the horrible events that we witnessed. It compounded the shock that these events were deliberately staged on and near a beautiful peer university campus in Charlottesville, Virginia – one devoted, as we are here, to diversity, inclusion, learning and scholarship. 
It is precisely because we have the wonderful privilege of freedom of expression in this country that we need to speak out in complete unanimity and in utter condemnation of this hatred and bigotry. These ideologies are absolutely contrary to what the University of Illinois System is and what it represents. In particular, we want to let our new students, our returning students and all members of the university family know that you are ALL welcome and embraced here. The U of I System cannot and will not tolerate actions and ideologies of discrimination, bigotry and hate.
Our universities stand with campuses and communities across the country that are stepping up in real time to help lead the way – condemning this awful behavior in any form. They and we also jointly reaffirm those bedrock values that promote a culture of understanding and respect for all – no matter what color, race, ancestry, age, interests, sexual orientation, LGBTQ status, religion, disability status, national origin, immigration status or gender.
On behalf of the U of I System, our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Charlottesville and our friends at the University of Virginia.

Yale is announcing today that Vice Chancellor for Research Peter Schiffer has accepted an offer to return to his alma mater as their inaugural vice provost for research.
I write to thank Peter for his leadership of our research enterprise for the past five years. He has transformed support for and coordination of the world-class research that is the bedrock of our university.
We wish him well, but we will miss his strategic and thoughtful approach to building systems, processes and structures that have cleared hurdles and allowed our faculty to focus on their paradigm-changing scholarship. Peter has been a consensus builder who has brought professionalism to the business, regulatory and compliance functions of the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research (OVCR). During his time at Illinois, research safety has improved, collaboration among research units across the university has increased, support for faculty proposal-writing outside of the STEM fields has been institutionalized and turnaround time for federally mandated research review processes has been reduced. He has prioritized much-needed investments and restructuring in HR, IT and business functions to better serve and support our research efforts, strongly emphasizing clear and consistent communications to build bridges and enhance collaboration across our decentralized university.                                                                                                                                     
Peter’s tenure as VCR has also coincided with the growth and strengthening of the university’s interdisciplinary research institute ecosystem, broadly recognized as one of the very best in the world.  Propelled by Peter’s execution of the campus strategic plan, these seven campus-wide institutes now include the Illinois Program for Research in the Humanities, as well as two new institutes: the Institute for Sustainability, Energy and Environment and the Interdisciplinary Health Sciences Institute. Just within the last month, these recent additions have led to the establishment of a Cancer Center on our campus and the announcement of the $104,000,000 Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation from the U.S. Department of Energy.
I know that the pull to return to his alma mater was great and that he and his wife, Sharon Hammes-Schiffer, who will join Yale’s chemistry faculty, are eager to be closer to their children.
I am confident that Peter will provide strong leadership to help Yale reach its goals in building its research enterprise, and I hope you will join me in thanking him for his transformational leadership here. We will schedule a reception sometime in the coming weeks.
I will share information soon about how I will fill Peter’s role before he begins his new position later this fall.
Best wishes,

I am pleased to announce that Steven Anderson will be the next dean of the School of Social Work effective September 16, pending approval by the University of Illinois Board of Trustees. Professor Anderson has served as the director of the School of Social Work at Michigan State University since 2014.
This is actually a homecoming for Professor Anderson, who earned both bachelor’s and master’s degrees in social work at Illinois and was a member of the school’s faculty for 13 years. Professor Anderson also holds both a master’s and a Ph.D. in political science from the University of Michigan. He left Illinois to become director of the School of Social Work at Arizona State University in 2011. 
Professor Anderson is an accomplished administrative leader, a respected and productive scholar and a decorated teacher. Throughout his career, he has demonstrated how academic scholarship can fuel innovations in training and development that lead to real, positive impacts and engagement with communities. And he has a clear recognition of the particular responsibilities and opportunities that come with service at public research universities like our own.
Dean Wynne Korr will continue to lead the school through September 15. I want to thank her for her leadership and service to her students, faculty and staff and for her willingness to stay just a little longer than she had planned to ensure an easy transition this fall.
I also want to thank the members of the search committee, chaired by College of Law Dean Vikram Amar, for their efforts in this national search. Professor Anderson brings an outstanding combination of prioritization of students, administrative experience, academic record and vision to the School of Social Work. He will be a strong addition to our academic leadership team here at Illinois.
Please join me in congratulating Professor Anderson and in welcoming him back to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The 1 percent program, which will be reflected in September’s payroll, builds on the mid-year, 2 percent performance-based program implemented in February.The program was developed thanks to ongoing efforts to steward our resources efficiently, and this month’s approval of the state’s first full budget since fiscal year 2015.We hoped to do more, but the program is tempered by prudent caution amid lingering financial uncertainties, including the impact of possible changes in state funding for pension and healthcare benefits. Still, it signals our commitment to employees and to an annual, predictable salary program to reward their dedicated service. This merit-based salary program will be applicable to most academic and civil service employees, except for employees whose wages are set through the collective bargaining process. Those employees may be eligible for an increase based upon the negotiation process and the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreement.I hope this program reflects our deep appreciation for everything you do to serve our universities, our students and our state.

Prior to the passage of the new income tax rate, the University of Illinois withheld at the 3.75% rate as required. The new 4.95% withholding rate will be implemented with payrolls paid on or after July 13, 2017. Due to the passage of the increased rate after the July 1, 2017, effective date, you may owe additional income tax next year when you file your 2017 Illinois individual income tax return.

I want to echo President Killeen’s expressions of relief, optimism and gratitude at the successful passage of a state budget by the Illinois legislature. It has been a long and hard road to reach this point – and I know that I have only been at this university for part of the impasse. I want to express my thanks to each of you for your efforts to protect our student experiences and core missions over the past 24 months even as the fiscal challenges and uncertainties mounted.
We’re still studying the final bills and assessing the implications but as President Killeen noted, the level of funding, while representing a 10% System-wide reduction from our 2015 appropriation, is much better than many earlier drafts and bills reflected. More critically, with this full budget in place we now have some of the stability we need to begin repairing the damage of the previous years and to strategically begin moving forward once more.
In addition to the full fiscal year 2018 appropriation, some notable components of the bills include nearly $300 million to cover the System-wide shortfall from last year as well as restoration of the Monetary Award Program (MAP) which provides essential financial aid to thousands of our students.  And, we hope to see several major capital projects abruptly halted last week resume work in the near future.
The full picture will become clearer in the coming weeks and we’ll have a much better understanding of the impact on our students, faculty, staff and operations. But for now, this is very good news and a reason for cautious celebration.
Thank you for your patience, your commitment and your dedication to this university throughout this historically difficult time.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"
2017-07-06T17:26:00Z,2017-07-06,17:26,64528,Statement on Budget Outcome,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28157.html,"July 6, 2017
Dear faculty, staff, students and friends:
Over the last few days, the Illinois legislature has come together in bipartisan efforts to end a historic budget impasse, approving revenue and spending bills that will provide full-year funding for the University of Illinois System and other essential state services.
I am deeply grateful to legislators for working overtime and making the difficult decisions on a compromise to avert the potentially dire consequences that loomed if the budget stalemate had extended through a third fiscal year.
I also want to sincerely and profoundly thank each and every one of you – our faculty, staff, students, alumni and friends. There is no overstating the crucial role that you have played. Your advocacy fostered an appreciation for our institution’s value among lawmakers that helped pave the way to this week’s budget resolution. And your commitment and hard work in support of the U of I System made it possible to weather the two-year funding shortfall with our excellence intact.
Thanks to you, our universities have remained strong and vibrant, and now stand ready to accelerate quickly and purposefully toward the high aspirations of our Strategic Framework – to make the U of I System a global model for service to students, innovation and the public good. We are determined to reward your loyalty and support by ensuring that your pride in the U of I System and our rich legacy of achievement continue to grow.
Under the budget agreement approved this week, the U of I System will receive:
•    An additional $300 million to cover funding for the second half of fiscal year 2017, providing a full-year appropriation when added to stopgap funding received for the first six months of the year.
•    About $583 million in funding for fiscal 2018, which began July 1. The appropriation is 10 percent less than the System’s last full appropriation in fiscal 2015, but higher than some earlier forecasts had predicted.
•    About $40 million in Medicaid funding to support our university hospital and clinics that provide critical care for underserved populations in the Chicago area.
Though no money was approved for new capital projects, the agreement should restore construction work that was halted July 1 when the fiscal year began with no budget.
The legislature also sent to the governor procurement reforms that should allow universities to operate with greater flexibility and efficiency, and with accountability, in the state purchasing process. Research procurement will be a notable beneficiary of the changes.
In addition, the budget provides Monetary Award Program (MAP) funding to support thousands of students across our three universities for both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018.
As with any compromise, the approved budget requires shared sacrifice by all stakeholders who rely on state funding. The U of I System commits to do its part and will participate in additional reform efforts as required to move the state forward. This budget, however, provides the urgently needed and critical support for our three best-in-class universities that transform students’ lives and fuel a pipeline of talent and innovation that drive economic growth for our state.
I hope the lessons learned during this long and difficult impasse will help to restore long-term stability. We will continue to advocate for this stable future through our proposed Investment, Performance, and Accountability Commitment (IPAC) reform, which would provide predictable funding in exchange for tangible standards that would expand our impact on the public good.
I thank you all again for your work, your patience and your support.
Sincerely,
Tim"

It is with great sorrow that I must tell you that the FBI announced this evening that they believe Yingying Zhang, a visiting scholar to our campus who disappeared three weeks ago, is no longer alive. They have made an arrest and now it is time for us as a university community to come together in support of her family and friends in this difficult time of loss.
There are no words that can explain why or how such a terrible thing should happen nor is there anything I might say that will ease the grief of any of you who knew her. There will be time for justice and for explanations in the days and weeks ahead. But in this moment, I ask each of you to keep her family in your thoughts and to make our collective focus a celebration of Yingying Zhang’s life.
There is always some joy to be found in the memories we hold of those who we lose even in the darkest of moments. Their stories, their dreams and the lives they have touched should to be shared. I ask all of you to help to ensure that Yingying is remembered for her kindness, her gentleness and her smile. This is the greatest gift we can offer as a community to her family and friends today.
Tomorrow evening, we are holding a campus wide memorial ceremony to honor her life, support her family and to remind everyone that wherever you might come from and whatever the language you speak, when you come to the University of Illinois, you become part of our community and our family.
I hope you will join that celebration in person or in spirit.

We are writing to update you on our search for Yingying Zhang, a 26-year-old visiting scholar who went missing June 9. Investigators from the University of Illinois Police Department, Illinois State Police and the FBI continue to work around the clock to find her. We have received hundreds of tips, and detectives are making use of every technological and human resource available to move toward a resolution as quickly as possible.
We realize that this has been a source of anxiety for our entire campus community. Our concern for Yingying grows with each day that passes, and we have personally witnessed the pain this uncertain time has created for her family members, friends and colleagues. While we cannot share specific details on the investigation in order to maintain its integrity and direction, we continue to make progress in our search, and we will not give up until we find her.
This week, it was announced that Champaign County Crime Stoppers, at the request of Yingying’s family, is offering a reward of up to $40,000 for information leading to an arrest or to Yingying’s location. Information can be submitted to Crime Stoppers by calling 217-373-8477, online at http://373tips.com, or through the P3 Tips mobile app. All messages to Crime Stoppers are completely anonymous, and Crime Stoppers does not ever learn the name of a source – even when paying a reward.

2017-06-16T14:42:00Z,2017-06-16,14:42,64515,Statement on Climate Change,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28145.html,"Dear friends and colleagues:I have watched with special attention as recent headlines refocused the world’s attention on the Paris climate accord.
Climate science and education is a strong interest of my wife, Roberta, and me, and has been a fixture of my own teaching and research for decades. In 1998, I had the honor of helping develop the early position statement on climate change and greenhouse gases for the American Geophysical Union, the world’s largest scholarly association of earth and space scientists. In the early 2000s, I served as director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, a federally funded laboratory that promotes discovery in climate science. And in my role as assistant director for the geosciences at the National Science Foundation from 2008 to 2012, I served as vice chair of strategic planning for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, a national effort that has driven our understanding of climate change.
As a scientist and as president, I am proud of the University of Illinois System’s commitment to climate science and to the development of an action agenda to understand, mitigate, adapt and build resiliency to increasingly severe, human-induced climate change.
Preserving the environment for the generations to follow has been ingrained in the culture of our three universities for years and is deeply embedded in the new Strategic Framework that will guide our future. The framework sets ambitious goals for us – to become the model for environmental sustainability, based on sound science and technology and excellence in teaching and knowledge dissemination.
We are already well on our way:
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has set a goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 in its Illinois Climate Action Plan.
The University of Illinois at Chicago’s Climate Commitments include goals to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, become a zero waste and net zero water campus, and protect biodiversity on campus.
The University of Illinois at Springfield’s sustainability efforts pledge to make UIS a role model for environmental sustainability through initiatives such as education and recycling programs, and a commitment to LEED construction standards,  including a new, first-ever student union that will open next year.
System-wide, our Strategic Framework targets carbon neutrality within the next four decades through a variety of approaches, including enhanced energy efficiency and conservation, the adoption of alternative power sources and modes of transportation, and adherence to LEED standards in all new construction and renovation.
What the U of I System brings to the table extends well beyond shrinking our carbon footprint. We are also working to solve climate challenges by building on our rich legacy of discovery, fostering breakthrough innovation that safeguards the environment while creating jobs and economic growth. For example, our researchers in Chicago recently developed a potentially game-changing option – a solar cell that produces burnable fuel cheaply and efficiently by capturing carbon dioxide and sunlight. In Urbana, a federally funded research center is working with industry to increase the power density of mobile electrified systems – in cars, construction equipment and aircraft. The research seeks improvements of 10 to 100 times over the current state of the art, which could reduce fuel consumption by more than 100 billion liters per year and prevent tens of millions of tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere.
An unwavering commitment to excellence and the public good have earned the U of I System a place among the world’s most renowned universities. Through excellence in scholarship and teaching and an abiding commitment to sustainability, we are determined to help lead the way toward the historic goals of the Paris accord – and then some – adding another chapter to the 150 years of achievement that have changed our world. Sincerely,Tim"

Real damage is being done, eroding the excellence that has made the U of I System a supplier of the world-class talent and innovation that are critical to move the state of Illinois forward. This situation is simply not worthy of hard-working Illinois families or of our 80,000-plus students. Over the last two years, the impasse has reduced our state funding by about $764 million – over $117 million more than our last full-year appropriation in fiscal 2015. Now, we face the prospect of yet another fiscal year with reduced – or even no – state support. We will continue working hard to weather the impasse through prudent management and cost-saving initiatives, and I assure you that we are – and will remain – strong! But we cannot keep sinking into a deeper financial hole without jeopardizing our life-changing contributions to students and the public good in our state.  So we are continuing our fervent advocacy in Springfield – injecting an even stronger sense of urgency as negotiations continue toward a budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1. For the sake of our state, our flagship university system and our collective future, this is a time to demand action, not just encourage it. On the positive side, I am very grateful to legislators for sending procurement reforms to the governor that would enable our universities and faculty researchers to work more effectively and efficiently. I hope that this bipartisan cooperation will now extend to a budget deal to end years of uncertainty and put Illinois firmly on the road to recovery. Thank you for your hard work and commitment during these challenging times, and I will update you as the budget process unfolds. Sincerely, Tim"

This month, we celebrated the graduation of more than 13,000 of our students. It was a splendid day, not just because the skies were clear and the temperatures were moderate, but because it marked a transformational moment in the lives of those who received their University of Illinois degrees.
We congratulate you graduates and we wish you great success as you use your Illinois education to live lives of fulfillment and impact.
We thank the faculty who taught and mentored each of our students and are grateful for your continued commitment to creating and sharing knowledge that improves life for everyone and that guides our next generation of leaders.
We are proud of the creative approaches, hard work, collegiality and dedication of our faculty, staff and students. We also want to recognize the intrinsic value of learning. As our Commencement speaker Nick Offerman said to our graduates, we should all maintain the attitude of a student, and, “If you're lucky, you will be surrounded by teachers for the rest of your life.” To the Class of 2017, as you take these next steps in your life’s journey, remember that your Illinois teachers will always be here for you – to delight in your accomplishments and offer encouragement when you face challenges. 
And just as she was when you posed for a picture with her Commencement week, Alma Mater will always be ready to welcome you back to your university home with open arms. Remember, Homecoming is just around the corner. We hope to see you then!
Best wishes for an exciting and productive summer.

I write to announce that the search for the next Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost has been publicly launched. The full position description along with requirements and information about the application process can be found at http://go.illinois.edu/provostsearch. Inquiries, nominations and applications are invited.
Our next provost must be a dynamic individual with the experiences, skills, passion and commitment necessary to lead one of the nation’s first public land-grant universities as we position ourselves for the challenges of the 21st century. The first step in this process will be the most important – finding the best pool of candidates in the world to evaluate.
Just as I’ve asked the members of the search committee to be aggressive and proactive in identifying candidates, I now make that same request of the entire university community. I encourage you to read the posting and share it with colleagues you believe would be outstanding in the role or to directly nominate individuals who you feel should be considered as potential candidates for this critical leadership position.
The most powerful advocates for this university are the faculty, staff and students who understand what a special place this is and what a rare career opportunity it is to become the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
I’m excited to launch this search and I thank all of you for your efforts to identify and recruit our next provost.

I write to announce the appointment of Ken Ballom as the interim vice chancellor for student affairs beginning on May 16, pending approval by the Board of Trustees. He is currently the associate vice chancellor for student affairs and dean of students.
Dean Ballom will serve in this interim role until the search for the permanent candidate is completed and the new vice chancellor is appointed. That national search is in the final stages and I am confident we will have our new leader in place this summer.
Having joined the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2008, Dean Ballom has more than 26 years of experience in student affairs. He previously served as dean of students at the University of North Texas. He holds degrees from Texas A&M-Commerce and from Western Illinois University.
I want to thank retiring Vice Chancellor Renee Romano for more than a decade of leadership and commitment to our students at Illinois. She has managed a large portfolio of responsibilities but has always kept the focus of her office on empowering and supporting those students.
Please join me in wishing Vice Chancellor Romano well in her next adventures and in thanking Ken Ballom for taking on this interim role for the university.

As you probably have heard, the University of Illinois System Offices recently conducted a review of their system units. The alignment implementation team conducted the analysis, in part, to determine whether some functions more appropriately should report to the universities rather than the System. 
The first phase of implementation of the review recommendations will be to transfer three units – purchasing offices within procurement, budget offices within OBFS and post award grants and contracts – from the System to the universities.
To the newest members of our Illinois team, we welcome you and we thank you for your good work to support our land-grant mission.
We have begun planning for the transition, and the System Offices are forming teams with representatives from each university to address the challenging work of allocating resources, addressing HR considerations, and determining operational requirements. Our target date for the integration is July 7, 2017. As with any major organizational restructuring, we will have more details as the integration move forward. 
The University leads on the transition teams include:
Budget: Vicky Gress, Office of the Provost
Grants and contracts: David Richardson, Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research
Purchasing: Mike DeLorenzo, Office of the Chancellor
We support the concept of carefully analyzing functions to determine where they should be in the organization to maximize efficiency and efficacy, and we hope that this transfer achieves that goal. We are confident that the integration of the teams into the University will continue the high level of service expected by our faculty and staff.
In present time of budget uncertainty, both the System and University leadership are committed to ensuring that these units join our campus with sufficient resources to provide the level of service required to support our institution. We all are also committed to ensuring that the transition is smooth and that the changes enhance our ability to fulfill the University’s teaching, research, public engagement and economic development missions. I ask for your patience and support as we move to this new operating model.
If you have questions about the transition, please contact Vicky, Dave, or Mike. Otherwise, please look for opportunities to share your ideas and advice in the near future.
Best regards,
Robert J. Jones Chancellor"

I am pleased to announce that Ed Seidel has agreed to serve as vice president for economic development and innovation for the University of Illinois System, pending Board of Trustees approval.
Since August, Ed has served as interim vice president for research, a position that has been restructured and retitled to reflect the U of I System’s focus on promoting research discovery that fosters innovation to help drive the state’s economy. A news release announcing his appointment is included below.
Ed is an award-winning researcher with a long record of leadership experience that includes three years as director of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications in Urbana-Champaign, and a tour as assistant director for Mathematical and Physical Sciences at the National Science Foundation. I am delighted that he has agreed to continue sharing his talents to serve our System as a whole and the needs of our state.
He assumed his new role in a designate capacity on April 16, and I hope you will join me in welcoming him and thanking him for his commitment to our great universities.
Sincerely,
Tim
Seidel named vice president for economic development and innovation Award-winning researcher will lead U of I System’s efforts to foster economic growthURBANA, Ill. — H. Edward Seidel has been named vice president for economic development and innovation for the University of Illinois System, pending Board of Trustees approval, President Tim Killeen announced Monday.
Seidel has served since August as interim vice president for research, a position that has been restructured and retitled to reflect the U of I System’s focus on fostering innovation to help drive the state’s economy through research and discovery.
Killeen said Seidel’s leadership over the last eight months has helped advance several new initiatives, such as working with executives of leading Illinois companies to develop collaborative research projects that will serve their businesses and lift the state’s economy.
“Ed’s personal experience with leading-edge research and with federal and international agencies – combined with his deep understanding of the U of I System’s capabilities and aspirations – has given him a rock-solid foundation for success,” Killeen said. “He’s off to a flying start.”
Seidel, who was named after a national search, assumed the newly retitled position in a designate capacity on April 16, pending formal approval by trustees at their May 11 meeting in Springfield. He succeeds Lawrence B. Schook, who stepped down after five years to return to his research and faculty work at the System’s universities in Urbana-Champaign and Chicago.
A longtime administrator and award-winning researcher, Seidel will lead an office that works with the System’s three universities to help manage their nearly $1 billion per year sponsored-research portfolio and oversee technology commercialization and economic development activities.
Before his appointment as interim vice president, Seidel served since 2013 as director of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Seidel, 59, retained the title of NCSA director while serving as interim vice president, assisted by William Gropp as acting director. Gropp, the Thomas M. Siebel Chair in Computer Science and director of the Parallel Computing Institute in the Coordinated Science Laboratory, has been appointed interim director in a designate capacity effective April 16, pending board approval, and will serve until a permanent NCSA director is named.
Seidel’s appointment as director three years ago marked a return to NCSA, where he led the center’s numerical group from 1991-96. He also was among the original co-principal investigators for Blue Waters, a federally funded project that brought one of the world’s most powerful supercomputers to Urbana-Champaign. He also is a Founder Professor in the Department of Physics and a professor in the Department of Astronomy at Urbana-Champaign.
His previous leadership roles include serving as senior vice president of research and innovation for the MIT Skoltech Initiative at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, directing the Office of Cyberinfrastructure and serving as assistant director for Mathematical and Physical Sciences at the National Science Foundation, leading the Center for Computation & Technology at Louisiana State University, and leading the numerical relativity group at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert-Einstein-Institut) in Germany.
Seidel is a fellow of the American Physical Society and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, as well as a member of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). His research has earned a number of awards, including the 2006 IEEE Sidney Fernbach Award, the Association for Computing Machinery’s Gordon Bell Prize and Heinz Billing Prize of the Max Planck Society.
He earned a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and physics at the College of William and Mary in 1981, a master’s degree in physics at the University of Pennsylvania in 1983 and a doctorate in relativistic astrophysics at Yale University in 1988.     ###The University of Illinois System is a world leader in research and discovery, the largest educational institution in the state with more than 81,000 students, 24,000 faculty and staff, and universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield. The U of I awards more than 20,000 undergraduate, graduate and professional degrees annually."
2017-04-20T10:24:00Z,2017-04-20,10:24,66890,Resources for Sexual Assault Awareness Month,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28098.html,"Dear members of the campus community,
Sexual violence is an issue which continues to threaten the safety and success of students at universities throughout the nation, and ours is no exception. During this Sexual Assault Awareness Month, we are asking you to take an active role in supporting survivors and ending sexual assault on our campus.
Campus sexual assault happens at an alarming rate, and no community is immune. A survey published last year indicates that one in seven women and one in 42 men at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have experienced nonconsensual sexual activity through physical force (http://wecare.illinois.edu/reports). This follows a disturbing national trend which suggests one in five women and one in 16 men on campuses throughout the country will experience sexual assault.
At Illinois, we believe survivors, and we offer a variety of resources to assist those who have been affected by sexual assault, domestic or dating violence, stalking, harassment or any other form of sexual violence.
Ending sexual assault requires the active participation of everyone in our campus community. We have a responsibility to believe and support survivors of sexual assault, and to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault.
Here are some ways you may be able to help prevent sexual assault:
Get involved. There are lots of opportunities to be active in the effort to end sexual assault on our campus. The more voices involved, the more we can help influence the culture and prevent sexual assault. To learn more, visit http://wecare.illinois.edu/prevention/.
Support survivors. Sexual violence can be a life-changing experience, and recovery is a healing process which requires time and support. To learn more about how you can support survivors, visit http://wecare.illinois.edu/help/support/.
Be an active bystander. The only way we can end sexual assault is by taking responsibility for its prevention and changing the culture which allows it to persist. Think about what you would do or say if you were in a position to stop a sexual assault from happening, and be a leader in modeling respectful language and behavior. Consider requesting an ICARE bystander intervention workshop for your student group: http://wecare.illinois.edu/prevention/students/icare/.
There are resources available to help survivors of sexual assault when they decide to seek assistance. Some resources are confidential and others are not, and they are available on campus and throughout the greater Champaign-Urbana community. To learn more about how to get help, visit http://wecare.illinois.edu.
We also invite you to attend any of a number of events this month which intend to engage new voices in our community in the discussion on sexual assault. For a full list of Sexual Assault Awareness Month events, visit http://go.illinois.edu/SAAM.
As always, we thank you for being an active participant in the safety of our entire campus community and in looking out for one another.

Dear Colleagues:
As you know, we have initiated a search for the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost of the Urbana-Champaign campus. In order to conduct the best possible search, we want input from our academic community about the important challenges facing the new provost and about the qualities and experiences that will best equip someone to succeed in this role. To this end, we are hosting an open forum where faculty, staff and students from across campus can meet with the members of the search committee. You are invited to participate in a campus-wide forum about the search:
Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost Search Town HallWednesday, April 26, 201712:00 - 1:30 p.m.314 A/B Illini Union
A link to the livestream will be available on http://go.illinois.edu/live during the event.
This opportunity for input is a key component of the search process, and we hope you will be able to participate. The categories of topics we are particularly interested in are:
Objectives for the new provost: What do you want the new provost to accomplish? What are the desired outcomes for the role and the University? How might success over the tenure of the successful candidate be measured?
Qualifications and Experience: Based on the objectives identified, what do you think are the qualifications and experience we should be looking for in a strong candidate? What is essential and what is desirable?
Personal Qualities: What are the personal attributes most important to this role?
Sources of candidate recommendations: To whom should the committee and the search firm reach out to identify strong candidates? The executive search firm Witt/Kieffer is assisting with this search. In addition to relying on their own networks and resources, it is important they have the opportunity to consult with you to help cultivate a strong candidate pool.  Accordingly, they are looking not only for names of potential candidates, but also for suggestions of good sources who might then lead to strong candidates. 
This has been designated as an “approved event."" With prior approval and operations permitting, non-exempt civil service employees may attend the event without loss of pay. If you will need disability-related accommodations in order to participate please contact Laura Bleakney at 217-300-2729 or llbarta@uillinois.edu. Early requests are strongly encouraged to allow sufficient time to meet your access needs.
Thank you for your participation in this important effort. Your input is an invaluable resource as we conduct all phases of this mission-critical search for the Urbana-Champaign campus, and the Committee and the Chancellor will make appropriate use of it at all stages in the process.

I am pleased to announce the members of the search committee who we have charged with identifying and vetting candidates for our next permanent vice chancellor for academic affairs and provost. Dean Vikram Amar of the College of Law will chair the committee, and the full membership list can be found at the end of this message. I want to thank all of the members for undertaking this effort on behalf of the entire University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
I commend the Academic Senate for its active role in helping shape the composition of the committee to effectively represent the breadth of this diverse university. The thirteen members chosen constitute a very good cross-section of our academic community that includes faculty members, academic and administrative staff and undergraduate and graduate students. The committee is large enough to engage in the thoughtful and deliberative evaluations necessary for a successful search, but small and agile enough to move forward with the kind of urgency this vacancy demands.
I’ve asked the committee to be aggressive and proactive in identifying the very best possible candidates in the world. I have stressed the importance of finding candidates who have the skills and experience that align with our public, land-grant mission. Our next provost will be an individual who has a demonstrated commitment to educational access and opportunity, fully embraces our values of diversity and inclusion and who respects the system of shared governance that is a hallmark here at Illinois. We are searching for a leader who will be a collaborative partner with our academic deans and actively engaged with our faculty to sustain and to advance the academic excellence of the university. And of course, finding a candidate with the administrative talents and the diplomatic skills to oversee one of the most complex academic operations in the country must be a priority.
The committee has met already to begin organizing itself for the search, and I have challenged them to have the next provost in place here at Illinois by the start of the next calendar year. The committee is being assisted by the executive search firm of Witt/Kieffer Executive Search. We expect the position to advertise and the public search to launch in the very near future. There will also be at least one public town hall meeting in which members of the campus community are encouraged to offer input to the committee about what characteristics and skills our next provost will need for success here.
As the process moves forward, I ask for your help and advice in both identifying and recruiting potential candidates for this essential position. I encourage you to begin submitting nominations immediately. Nominations and inquiries may be e-mailed directly to Witt/Kieffer (IllinoisProvost@wittkieffer.com) and should include the name, position, address and telephone number of the potential candidate.
The most powerful advocates for this university are the faculty, staff and students who understand what a special place this is and what a rare career opportunity it is to become the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Thank you again to Dean Amar and to members of the search committee for their service.

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This Campus Safety Notice is issued in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about crime to aid in the prevention of similar crimes and to assist in the identification of offenders.
This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, please visit CrimeReports.com, download the Campus Safety Mobile Guide, or visit the University of Illinois Police Department to view the daily crime log.
The following attempted robbery took place between 11:00 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. on Tuesday, March 28, 2017 in the area of 600 South Gregory Street (map) in Urbana:
A University of Illinois student reported that she was approached on the sidewalk by three men who began asking her for money.  One of the men grabbed her cell phone and FitBit.  The men dropped the victim’s property and fled when they heard sirens from a nearby emergency vehicle.
The University of Illinois Police is investigating this incident. The University of Illinois Police Department has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area, and we are fortunate to have our force supplemented by the Urbana and Champaign police departments. Between these agencies, the Urbana campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 1,000 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS) or by visiting www.373tips.com. Anonymous tips may also be sent via text message by texting keyword ""CCTIP"" plus the information to 274637 (CRIMES).
This is our community. Let's stay together.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks escort if you need one, or download the app for iOS or Android.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.
If you choose to consume alcohol, please be responsible. Remember your ability to respond is diminished by overconsumption of alcohol.

The $44M MCORE Project will transform Green, White, and Wright Streets and Armory Avenue over the next four years by better balancing all modes of transportation with complete streets, upgrading infrastructure, and improving connections between the University of Illinois and the cities of Champaign and Urbana.
MCORE Project 2 will begin March 6 and result in the complete closure of East Green Street to thru traffic until December 2017.
MCORE Project 1 will begin March 13 on Green Street, starting at Wright Street and moving east toward Lincoln Avenue with periodic lane closures anticipated initially.
More information about MCORE, including project maps, and a question form is available at http://mcoreproject.com. Construction updates will be regularly provided there and on MCORE Facebook and Twitter accounts.
Not only is the scale of MCORE bigger than typical local street projects, but to meet federal grant funding deadlines, phases of the work must take place even though the University is in session.
While construction will create temporary inconveniences around campus, when completed, MCORE will provide for a more sustainable and connected community that will benefit future generations.
We are grateful to our fellow partner agencies the City of Champaign, City of Urbana, and MTD for all their hard work and help to make MCORE a reality."

On Friday, March 3, 2017, many students and visitors will participate in an event known as Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. While the University does not support or condone this event, steps are being taken to ensure safety and to minimize disruption to classes and campus operations.
The Champaign, Urbana, and University of Illinois police departments, assisted by other local and state agencies, will patrol the campus district on March 3. They will enforce all applicable ordinances in commercial and residential areas and have authority to intervene if private parties threaten to disturb the peace. In addition, Champaign and Urbana officials will enact restrictions on liquor sales intended to curb overconsumption. Emergency medical personnel will be available to provide care.
University police will continue to focus on protecting students, staff, faculty, and University property. If asking a disruptive student to leave class could escalate into a confrontation, you may seek assistance from these officers. Should you need to report an incident, call METCAD at 911 for emergencies, 333-8911 for non-emergencies.
As in years past, we have made clear to students that academic business will continue as usual on Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. That has helped to minimize disruptions. Instructors are encouraged not to cancel classes.
The Student Code http://studentcode.illinois.edu/ addresses student responsibilities on campus. Sections 1-102(d) and 1-302(f) concern classroom conduct expectations, and section 1-307 focuses on alcohol consumption. The Code empowers instructors to ask disruptive students to leave class; after class, names of disruptive students should be reported to the Office of Student Conflict Resolution at 333-3680.
Students will be asked not to bring any liquids into Foellinger Auditorium and Lincoln Hall Theatre. Longstanding policy prohibits liquids and food in these spaces.
Students who interfere with the academic mission of the University will face serious consequences. Thank you for reinforcing this message before and on March 3.
Office of Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost Office of Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs"
2017-02-23T11:40:00Z,2017-02-23,11:40,66924,A Message to the Campus Community,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28053.html,"Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
Universities like ours are places where controversial and sometimes divisive issues are considered and debated. It is the role of higher education to address difficult topics, and it is often at the uncomfortable edges of challenging conversations where we make our greatest advances.
We value respectful discourse while also recognizing that even offensive speech is protected by the First Amendment.
The best recourse to speech with which we disagree is more speech:
Speech that clearly articulates a stronger and better argued point of view
Speech that represents the values we hold most dear
Speech that builds connections and shared understanding
We are going to see and hear perspectives that sometimes anger, offend and even frighten us. In a year that has stirred emotions across such a broad range of issues it is not difficult to find a topic that is contentious and has the potential to spark intense disagreement. This week we had chalking on the Quad. The week before saw an Israeli flag defaced at a protest. We’ve had students criticized for their political views. Members of our Muslim community and students with uncertain immigration status have been harassed. And once again we’re seeing Unofficial t-shirts that many in our community view as insulting to Native Americans. We can’t predict what the next issue will be but we know there will be one. These are often painful moments for our students, faculty, staff and community and we need to support one another as we strive to address divisive issues in society. 
There are campus policies in place to ensure the physical safety of everyone in the community. We work with campus and local public safety officials to ensure people may gather safely and express concerns or opinions. There are many resources on campus to ensure safety and to address incidences of bias and discrimination. Acts of intolerance should be reported to the Office of the Dean of Students at 217-333-0050, tolerance@illinois.edu or http://go.illinois.edu/intolerance (for anonymous reporting) or contact the Office of Diversity, Equity and Access at 217-333-0885 (http://diversity.illinois.edu). When we learn of acts of intolerance, we convene our Bias Incident Investigation and Response Team within 48 hours to determine appropriate course of action.
Every one of us has the rights of free speech and free expression. And every one of us also has the power to choose how we exercise those rights. We are at our best when we engage in dialogue that encompasses the widest range of views and voices. We do not need to agree on every issue. But hopefully we can agree that showing respect and regard for those around us is always a choice we can make. 
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor John P. WilkinInterim Provost Designate C. Renee RomanoVice Chancellor for Student Affairs"
2017-02-22T15:24:00Z,2017-02-22,15:24,66919,A Note of Thanks,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28052.html,"Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:
It is difficult for me to believe that nearly five months - 150 days today - have passed since I began my tenure as chancellor here at Illinois.
I want to thank all of you who have so warmly welcomed me and my wife Lynn into the University of Illinois family and into this community. Your patience, good will (and good humor) and support have helped us go from feeling like visitors here to knowing that we are among neighbors and friends. Thanks for making our transition so easy.
I have spent much of these first 150 days trying to meet as many of our faculty, staff, students, alumni, friends and supporters as I could fit into my schedule. I knew when I arrived that leadership of one of the top 10 public land grant universities in the nation brings a steep and long learning curve. While I can find the facts and figures in books, articles and reports I can only get a true sense of the personality, spirit and will of this university through the voices of the people who know it best and who care deeply about its future.
I’ve been trying to hear as many of those voices as possible through hundreds of meetings – with individuals, with small groups, with large gatherings and with people who just stop me on the street to talk. I’ve visited our colleges, been in our residence halls and had backstage tours from the Krannert Center to the shops of Facilities and Services. I’ve spoken with our students who care about such a wide range of issues. I’ve talked with our deans, department heads, academic senate members and faculty from units across the campus. I’ve been fortunate to meet alumni in Chicago, on both coasts and many states in between. I’ve had conversations with our state and federal legislators, our local government officials, community and business leaders and representatives of some of our most important federal funding agencies.
What has emerged in every conversation is a profound and honest belief in the potential and the responsibility of this university to make a difference in the world around us. There is a common and vocal pride in our status as a public, land grant university. While there is not necessarily universal agreement on how we should deliver on our promises of access, educational opportunity, scholarship and research and public engagement, we as a university community are in strong agreement that respecting and reinvigorating our land grant charge needs to drive our strategic plans and actions. We diverge in our definitions and ideas of what it actually means to be a land grant university for the 21st century. As we get set to launch our Sesquicentennial Celebration and our comprehensive campaign, this is the perfect time to consider what we will achieve and how we will position ourselves for the next 150 years.
Helping us come together to answer that question is where I will be turning my focus in the coming weeks and months. I will be asking my leadership team and our deans to help us determine the best ways to convene the campus and collectively determine our next strategic actions and priorities. We have scheduled a campus-wide town hall meeting on April 19 in the Illini Union to discuss the state of the campus and to outline the initial steps we will be taking to lay out our plans for the future. I hope you will plan to attend or to watch it streamed.
Thank you all for making my first 150 days at Illinois productive, memorable and thoroughly enjoyable. I know we are just getting started, but I am excited about what we are going to achieve together.
With gratitude,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

2017-02-13T10:08:00Z,2017-02-13,10:8,17563,John Wilkin named interim vice chancellor for academic...,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28040.html,"Dear Faculty and Staff:
I am pleased to name John Wilkin, dean of the University Library, as the interim vice chancellor for academic affairs and provost designate. Dean Wilkin’s seamless combination of a thoughtful, balanced demeanor along with the practical experience and working knowledge of academic operations established him as the right person for the position at this critical time. He will begin in this role on Feb. 18. The appointment is pending the review and approval of the Board of Trustees.
I have been consulting with our deans, department executives, students, institute directors, faculty members, staff and other campus leaders to fill this key position since Interim Provost Feser announced his departure. I want to thank each of you in the campus community who offered nominations, advice on the qualities we need and honest feedback about possible candidates. We are fortunate at Illinois to have a number of talented and experienced people qualified and willing to take on this responsibility.
What became clear to me is that Dean Wilkin is a leader who will continue to move this institution forward and who has the respect of the faculty, staff and students who he will represent. We have many challenges ahead of us, and we need an interim provost who can build consensus, foster collaborations and take an active role in shaping the strategic plans and vision for our university. I look forward to working closely with Dean Wilkin in that capacity.
I want to thank Ed Feser for his strong leadership during his time as interim provost. His leadership around the budget reform effort and positioning us for long term fiscal stability has been critical and the groundwork he has established will let us continue that work.
Dean Wilkin joined Illinois in May of 2013 as the Juanita J. and Robert E. Simpson Dean of Libraries and University Librarian and a professor of library administration. Prior to that, he served in a number of library-related capacities at the University of Michigan over the course of two decades, most recently as the executive director of HathiTrust and the associate university librarian for publishing and technology. He has graduate degrees in English from the University of Virginia and in library science from the University of Tennessee, as well as a bachelor’s degree in literature from Antioch College.
Dean Wilkin does not intend to be a candidate for the provost position, and he will meet with members of the Library leadership team to identify an acting University Librarian.
We will move as quickly as possible to fill the permanent provost position. I am working with the Academic Senate to establish a search committee composed of faculty, students, academic professionals and other stakeholders. My goal is to have the committee finalized and a national search underway by the middle of March with a final candidate selected in the fall semester.
I thank Dean Wilkin for his willingness to take on the interim vice chancellor for academic affairs and provost designate position, and I look forward to the work we’ll do together.

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes.
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes. We are not including certain details in this alert so as to avoid releasing identifying information about the victim.
The University of Illinois Police Department has received a report that a student was sexually assaulted at approximately 3:30 a.m. on Sunday, February 12, 2017, at a residence hall in Champaign by a person known to the victim.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to assist those involved in this incident and will continue to take actions to maintain the safety and security of the campus community.
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.
If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another person, intervene if it’s safe to do so or call for assistance.
While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. The university, community organizations and local law enforcement offer a number of reporting options.
Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.
It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves.

We are writing to share with you that we have selected Barry Benson to serve as our Vice Chancellor for Advancement at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Mr. Benson comes to us from the University of Arizona, where he serves as the senior vice president of development at the University of Arizona Foundation. As we prepare for the public launch of our major campaign, it is critical that we have a talented, strong, high-energy and passionate leader in this role. Mr. Benson is a highly accomplished development professional who has a deep familiarity with large public research universities and experience in major campaigns.
It was important to recruit a VCA who had direct experience working with deans and academic leaders. Mr. Benson has directed a College of Engineering development program, and he has held senior leadership positions at a large public university foundation. 
In short, Mr. Benson has the skills, passion and energy to lead our Advancement team. Mr. Benson will begin his new role March 16, 2017. Thank you in advance for helping us welcome him to the Illinois family.
We also want to thank the search committee and all those who participated in the search process, and we offer special thanks to Ed Ewald who has graciously served as interim leader of the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Institutional Advancement ensuring steady leadership during this transition.

Earlier today, writing on behalf of the University of Illinois System, President Killeen, Executive Vice President Wilson, and three chancellors expressed great concern about negative consequences stemming from President Trump’s recent Executive Order on immigration. We write to amplify this concern and to restate the principles that will guide us at this unsettled and unsettling time.
At Illinois, individual faculty, students, staff, and visiting scholars—along with their families—have been directly affected by the executive order. Overnight, they have been made to feel uncertain about their welcome in this country and our community. We have reached out to these individuals with assurances that they remain more than welcome here: that their presence and contributions sustain Illinois’ commitment to be an inclusive land-grant university with a truly global impact.
We ask that you join us in standing with those who are affected by the executive order. Together, we will defend the unfettered academic inquiry that is foundational to our intellectually diverse enterprise. Our institutional values demand nothing less of us. The marginalization of international faculty, students, staff, and visiting scholars diminishes us all. This we will not abide.
The university will advocate vigorously against any actions that are needlessly detrimental to our international community. Yet despite all the assurances we can give, we know that much uncertainty remains, and out of uncertainty grows fear. What can be done? We can fight fear with compassion. Time and again our community has summoned compassion for its members in distress, and we trust that it will do so again. Information also helps fight fear, so let us explain how we will keep you informed as we do and learn more.
We have updated information available detailing support for international members of our campus community at http://go.illinois.edu/openillinois2.
We have created an Administrative Working Group on Immigration that has membership from key offices across campus to help us stay joined up as we deal with actions adversely affecting our international populations.
Associate Chancellor Robin Kaler will serve as the point of contact for reporting specific cases where our students, faculty, staff, postdocs or visiting scholars have been detained or may otherwise experience difficulties because of the new executive order. Please relay any information about such cases to Robin at rkaler@illinois.edu.
We do not have any easy answers to offer and there is still a great deal that we are trying to understand. But we do know that this is one of those times at Illinois when extraordinary effort and extraordinary kindness can combine to make an extraordinary difference. We are counting on it—and on you.

The University of Illinois System is a leader in teaching, discovery and outreach in our state, the nation and the world. Our doors are open and welcoming to talented individuals from around the globe and we pledge to ensure that this openness continues into the future. It is at the heart of our commitment to global access and extraordinary impact and is reflected in our Nondiscrimination Statement.
We are greatly concerned about the negative consequences for members of our community and their families arising from President Trump’s recent Executive Order instituting changes in immigration policy.
We want to assure you that we are monitoring events closely and we are working with other universities, national organizations, legal counsel and government officials to support and protect all of our international faculty, visiting scholars and students.
Because of the entry restrictions cited in the new Executive Order, we strongly recommend that students and scholars who might be affected defer travel outside the U.S. until there is fuller assessment of the Executive Order and its implementation, including resolution of several newly mounted legal challenges.
We are working with colleagues at other universities and with national higher education advocacy organizations, such as the Association of Public & Land-Grant Universities, Association of American Universities and American Association of State Colleges and Universities to assess the effects of the immigration directives and to urge that the Executive Order be reconsidered as quickly as possible. We are also engaging with members of the Illinois congressional delegation to share specific concerns.

The University of Illinois System has earned a place as a global leader in education and discovery by opening our doors wide to the most talented students – and that includes our undocumented students.
Recent speculation that the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program could be eliminated only strengthens our resolve to continue in our efforts to support student welfare, success and their collective impact on the public good.
Since 2012, DACA has supported undocumented students across the U of I System, providing a life-changing pathway to a University of Illinois degree without fear of deportation. The program also supports the best interests of our state and nation, nurturing the talents of students who are already an integral part of our universities and who wish to become leaders in the workforce and in their communities.
The U of I System remains firmly committed to the principles of opportunity and equality, and will advocate strongly for recently introduced federal legislation known as the BRIDGE Act (Bar Removal of Individuals who Dream and Grow our Economy), a bipartisan proposal cosponsored by Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin that would extend the provisions of the DACA program for three years. We also will continue to champion proposed state legislation that would give four-year public universities in Illinois the authority to provide institutional financial aid for undocumented students.
In the meantime, the University of Illinois System and all three universities pledge to continue the following:•    We admit students without consideration of their immigration status.•    We do not inquire about or keep records of whether a student is an undocumented immigrant.•    We vigorously protect students’ privacy rights in accordance with the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). We do not disclose private information about students unless compelled by law to do so.•    Our campus police officers do not inquire about immigration status and do not detain or make arrests based solely on immigration status unless compelled by law to do so.•    Campus police will not detain an individual in response to a federal agency or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) request unless doing so is required by law or unless an individual has been charged or convicted of a felony.
From the very beginning, the U of I System has been an institution centered squarely on students. And that means all of our students.

Dear faculty, staff, students and friends:
With the start of the New Year, stopgap state funding that has helped support the University of Illinois System for the last six months ended. My priority is to vigorously advocate to restore full state appropriations for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 and going forward. 
In the meantime, we are committed to fulfilling the aspirational goals of our new Strategic Framework despite the current budget uncertainties. We will continue to provide a best-in-class educational experience for students, we will retain and recruit great faculty and staff, and until the state honors its obligation, we will continue to advance state Monetary Award Program grants for our students under the same conditions that we have followed since the budget impasse began.
We are positioned to sustain our strong performance thanks to the commitment and creativity of our administrative leadership, faculty and staff, whose thoughtful stewardship has produced cost savings and efficiencies that have maintained our excellence and our service to a growing student population.
In the coming weeks, my team and I will aggressively champion the U of I System’s interests at every turn as the General Assembly resumes budget negotiations, building on advocacy efforts that include almost daily connections with legislators and the governor’s staff. We also will continue our advocacy for the U of I Investment, Performance, and Accountability Commitment (IPAC). This groundbreaking legislative proposal would redefine our partnership with the state, providing predictable funding for university operations in exchange for tangible performance goals that support Illinois students and serve the needs of the state.
My thanks to all of your for your dedication, loyalty and support, and I wish you all the best as a new semester begins.
Sincerely,Tim"

Welcome back to campus!
As you begin the new semester, we encourage you to take a few moments and visit the Run > Hide > Fight website and review the guidelines for what to do in an emergency.
Emergencies can happen anywhere, anytime. When we’re faced with any kind of emergency – fire, severe weather or if someone is trying to hurt you – we have three options: run, hide or fight.
On the site above, you can watch a two-minute video that explains what to do in any kind of emergency. The Public Safety Department also has a site that lets you see floor plans showing exits, storm refuge areas and areas of rescue assistance (if they exist) for the buildings where you attend classes.
Also, please visit emergency.illinois.edu in order to register your cellphone to receive Illini-Alert text messages so we can notify you in real time when an emergency happens. You may enter up to three cellphone numbers, and we recommend adding a family member’s contact information as well.
We have asked your instructors to review these materials with you on the first day of class. If any of your instructors do not share the information, please ask them to do so. If you have additional questions, please contact the UI Police Department at 217/333-1216.
We wish you a safe and productive semester.

It is with mixed emotions that I tell you Interim Provost Ed Feser has accepted the position of provost and executive vice president at Oregon State University. While this is an opportunity for Ed to guide an aspirational institution with growing strength in disciplines that are dear to him, we all will miss his wise and thoughtful counsel, his unwavering integrity and his deep understanding of all aspects of our great university.
During my time at Illinois, Ed has been an invaluable partner. Most critically, he has helped lead through one of the most difficult financial times in the university’s history and has championed a new budgeting system and model that will benefit our students, faculty and staff and support our mission for years to come.
This opportunity at OSU allows Ed and his wife Kathy to be closer to their family and to the mountains, ocean and great outdoors that are a sustaining force in their lives, and to help a great, west coast land-grant institution fulfill its mission.
Ed is one of the nation’s most outstanding academic leaders, and he will make a transformational impact at Oregon State just as he has done at Illinois. We are a stronger institution because of Ed’s contributions.
Ed begins his new role in late February.
Please join me in thanking him for his dedicated service to the university and wishing him all the best in his new role.
Best wishes,
Robert J. Jones Chancellor"

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes.
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes. We are not including certain details in this alert so as to avoid releasing identifying information about the victim.
The University of Illinois Police Department received a report on Thursday that a student was sexually abused at 1 a.m. on Sunday, Dec. 4, at a university residence hall by a person known to the victim.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to assist those involved in this incident and will continue to take actions to maintain the safety and security of the campus community.
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.
If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another person, intervene if it’s safe to do so or call for assistance.
While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. For more information about reporting rape, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.
Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.
It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.

Duplicates are just a few clicks away, even as late as April 14 or 15.
**New for tax year 2016**
The University of Illinois System implemented 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) to enhance and strengthen the protocols for securing sensitive data, including personal data for University employees. If you consent to retrieve your electronic forms, you can still access your W-2, 1042-S and/or 1095-C from on campus without using 2FA. 2FA is required when you access your W-2, 1042-S, and/or 1095-C from home or an off campus computer.
If you have not already done so, please enroll in 2FA as soon as possible. You can set up 2FA from any on-campus University network computer (such as your work computer or a department computer) by visiting https://verify.uillinois.edu/.  
This extra security step will allow you the ability to retrieve your personal tax form(s) from an off-campus network. Completing your 2FA enrollment now will both secure your information and help you avoid inconveniences later.

In the weeks since November’s election, there has been a call across the country by many individuals and groups to declare college campuses as sanctuaries for undocumented students, including petition drives at each of the University of Illinois System’s three universities. These petitions, which we have reviewed carefully, raise a myriad of definitional and legal questions.
We have taken time to examine the complex issues at hand. As a public institution of higher education, we must uphold state and federal laws. We cannot declare our campuses as sanctuaries, as the concept is not well specified and may actually jeopardize our institution. However, we will continue to do everything we can within the law to reassure, support and protect our students. Let us be clear … that includes our undocumented students.
Since the U of I’s land-grant founding, the core of our mission has been centered squarely on students, ensuring that every deserving young person has equal access to pursue his or her dreams through educational attainment.
In the years since, our commitment to inclusion and diversity has grown. We are expanding opportunities that prepare our students for an increasingly global workplace by exposing them to people they might not otherwise have met and ideas that they may have never considered.
We are proud that the U of I System is already a leader in supporting undocumented students. Consistent with current practices, we will continue to protect student and employee confidential information to the fullest extent allowed by law. We also support legislation that would give four-year public universities in Illinois the legal authority to provide institutional financial aid for undocumented students. The bill would add to the support services we already have in place to help them succeed.
Serving students, regardless of their background, is at the forefront of who we are and what we have always been. The University of Illinois System will continue to participate in conversations about these issues at the state and national level. We pledge to advocate for and work to protect our undocumented students. We hope you will join us.
Sincerely,
Tim Killeen, President, University of Illinois System Barb Wilson, Executive Vice President, University of Illinois System Michael Amiridis, Chancellor, University of Illinois at Chicago Robert Jones, Chancellor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Susan Koch, Chancellor, University of Illinois at Springfield"

I am pleased to announce the appointment of our newest University of Illinois Presidential Fellows – Professor Antoinette Burton of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Professor Lisa Lee of the University of Illinois at Chicago.
Both are highly respected scholars and will share their talents on a part-time basis over the next year to help build on the U of I System’s long legacy of leadership in the arts and humanities. They will collaborate on an important initiative tied to the next year’s sesquicentennial of the university and the bicentennial of our state that follows in 2018. It will celebrate the System’s rich history of achievement, and reimagine how its world-class programs in the arts and humanities can continue to create social change and lead progress as our nation’s 21st state moves into the 21st century.
Their work will inspire us toward the high-aspiration goals of our new Strategic Framework, which seeks to expand scholarship in the arts and humanities that is so critical in our technology driven age – enriching lives and transforming the human experience by forging solutions to complex social challenges.
Professor Burton, who joined the Urbana-Champaign faculty in 1999, specializes in the history of Britain and the British Empire, as well as in the history of women and gender. She is a professor of history, the Bastian Professor of Global and Transnational Studies and director of the Illinois Program for Research in the Humanities.
Professor Lee is director of the School of Art & Art History at UIC and joined the university in 2006 as director of the Jane Addams Hull-House Museum. A member of UIC’s art history and gender and women’s studies faculty, her research examines museums, critical theory, diversity and cultural sustainability.
The Presidential Fellows Program was created this year to tap into our deep pool of faculty talent for critical strategic initiatives that expand our service to students and the public good. Professor Burton and Professor Lee follow our inaugural Presidential Fellow, Professor James D. Anderson, a renowned scholar who worked with me and other university officials on issues of inclusiveness and equality before he was named interim dean of Urbana-Champaign’s College of Education in August.
I am grateful to Professor Anderson for his service, and look forward to working with Professor Burton and Professor Lee as they launch new initiatives that are critical to our future.
Sincerely,Tim"

The board’s unanimous decision has implications for the University of Illinois System because healthcare costs for our faculty and staff are established based on terms negotiated in the state's AFSCME contract.
The impact of the ILRB’s decision is still unknown because a written ruling has not yet been issued and may not be available until next week. It could open the door for the state to implement its final bargaining offer, which may increase employee healthcare costs. However, AFSCME is asking the state to restart negotiations, and has publicly indicated that it anticipates appealing the ILRB ruling in state court. Therefore, these issues may not be resolved for many months. 
Although the labor board ruling may be a noteworthy step in the process, it is impossible to predict with any certainty the end result and impact on University employee healthcare costs during this lengthy ongoing litigation and negotiation process.
In the meantime, U of I System leaders continue to voice concerns to state leaders, including advocating on behalf of faculty and staff about the state’s claim payment delay. Our efforts have helped spur some progress on dental claims, and we continue to vigorously oppose the state’s suggestion that it may collect premiums retroactively. These advocacy efforts will continue.
I hope you will join our advocacy efforts, and I will continue to update you as the process unfolds. Sincerely,TimFor more information: November 16, 2016, Chicago Tribune storyQ & A from this summer’s Healthcare Information SessionsState Healthcare Update Webpage"

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, please visit CrimeReports.com, download the Campus Safety Mobile Guide, or visit the University of Illinois Police Department to view the daily crime log.
The Urbana Police Department has informed University of Illinois Police of two robberies which occurred off campus. Around 1:45 a.m. on Friday, Nov. 11, near High Street and Coler Avenue, Urbana, a U. of I. student was approached from behind by three men, one of whom struck the student and demanded his wallet and cellphone. The student complied, and then ran away. Around 8:10 p.m. on Sunday, Nov. 13, near Illinois Street and Busey Avenue, Urbana, a U. of I. student was approached from behind by three men who took various items from the student. The student never turned around to look at the men. Neither of the victims was seriously injured.
The University of Illinois Police Department has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area, and we are fortunate to have our force supplemented by the Urbana and Champaign police departments. Between these agencies, the Urbana campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. About 1,500 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information is encouraged to contact the Urbana Police Department at 217-384-2320. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS) or by visiting www.373tips.com.
This is our community. Let's stay together.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks escort if you need one, or download the app for iOS or Android.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.

On Tuesday, November 15, faculty, students, and staff will need to use an additional piece of authenticating software to connect from off-campus to on-campus computers.
To effectively reduce these current cyberattacks and keep the Illinois network safe, customers who connect through Microsoft Remote Desktop will need to use  either the University's Virtual Private Network (VPN) or the Remote Desktop Gateway service. For more information about the upcoming changes and how to setup a VPN or Remote Desktop Gateway on your computer, please see: https://techservices.illinois.edu/news/2016/increased-security-campus-computers-will-help-thwart-cyberattacks.
All current indications suggest that no data have been lost, but the attacks are straining crucial infrastructure services. Unfortunately, these attacks are a reality of the connected world we live in. We continue to work on efforts to reduce these types of attacks. Tuesday’s change represents the first of a series of changes related to how individuals will remotely access University computing resources in the future.
After January 30, 2017, individuals attempting to access computing resources from the Internet using Virtual Network Computing (VNC) or Telnet will need to utilize the University’s VPN service.
After April 3, 2017, individuals attempting to access computing resources from the Internet using Secure Shell (SSH) will need to utilize the University’s VPN service or the future SSH Gateway service.
Please note that if we see increased attack traffic associated with VNC, Telnet, or SSH that jeopardizes the University of Illinois, we may need to accelerate these timelines.

Dear colleagues:
Over the last two years, an ongoing state budget impasse has magnified the challenges that unpredictable state funding create for the University of Illinois System and our efforts to serve a growing student body and the public good.
Legislation introduced today in Springfield seeks to restore certainty and stability through a groundbreaking agreement that would be a first-of-its-kind for Illinois and arguably the most comprehensive and forward-thinking in the nation.
The proposed Investment, Performance, and Accountability Commitment (IPAC) is a win-win for the U of I System and the people of Illinois. Our universities would receive a five-year funding guarantee, at levels to maintain their excellence, along with regulatory reforms that would improve efficiency across the System. In return, the U of I would set into law its commitment to Illinois students and the needs of our state, locking in tangible performance standards for student costs, in-state enrollment, and graduation and retention rates.
At its meeting today in Chicago, the Board of Trustees unanimously approved a resolution supporting IPAC and I hope you will join them, encouraging your legislators to stand with an agreement that will move our universities and our state forward.

Every four years, one Wednesday in November begins a new chapter in the leadership of our nation. The 2016 election is over and the voters of the U.S. have chosen our next president. This campaign season has been challenging in its tone and rhetoric. It has stirred emotions and reminded all of us that we still have a lot of ground to cover together before we can live up to the ideals of being a united country. But that was also true in our nation’s first election and in every one that has followed.
So, on this Wednesday in 2016, we have a chance to take a breath, look around and remind ourselves that we are a community defined by how we treat one another and by our willingness to focus on how we move forward together. We don’t have to agree with each other to respect one another. We don’t have to be friends to work together toward a better future. We are in this together. And there is no place better suited to demonstrate what that looks like in practice than our university.

We would like to provide you with more information regarding the Illini-Alert messages you received earlier this evening. The Champaign Police Department has released the following details:
At about 9:48 p.m. Wednesday night, police responded to the area of First and Green streets, Champaign, after receiving reports of shots fired. A 41-year-old Champaign woman was taken to the hospital for a non-life threatening gunshot wound. The suspect in the shooting, a 21-year-old man, arrived at the hospital with a non-life threatening gunshot wound about 90 minutes later. Neither of the individuals involved is a U. of I. student.
Preliminary evidence suggests that the shooting was the result of a domestic altercation which took place inside an apartment.
Investigators continue to process evidence and interview potential witnesses to learn more about the altercation and the shooting incident. Anyone with information is encouraged to contact the Champaign Police Department at 217-351-4545. Information may be submitted anonymously by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477, online at 373tips.com or by texting “CCTIP” plus the information to 274637 (CRIMES).
While this appears to be an isolated incident, this once again is an unambiguous reminder that no community is immune from gun violence. The University of Illinois Police Department is working closely with our community partners – including the Champaign Police Department, Urbana Police Department, Champaign County Sheriff’s Office, and others – to systematically identify violent offenders and the people they associate with. Through initiatives like our Street Crimes Task Force and C-U Fresh Start program, we believe we have already prevented instances of gun violence in our greater community, and we will continue with those efforts.
Tonight’s incident also reminds us that domestic violence persists in our campus community and beyond. Whether you have experienced domestic violence yourself or you wish to support someone who has, we encourage everyone to research the resources available at wecare.illinois.edu. There is help available in our community whenever those affected are ready to seek it out.
We once again ask our campus members to pull together and to look out for each other. Our collective safety is everyone’s responsibility, and we thank you for being an active participant in the well-being of our community.
Sincerely,
Jeff Christensen

I have now officially been on the job here at Illinois for seven days. It was a week that saw both sadness and tragedy, followed by a powerful display of hope and support. And it was a week that demonstrated what a tremendously caring community I have just joined.
It is my privilege to serve as the 10th chancellor of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. As I said on the day when the Board of Trustees made my appointment official, this is my dream job. And in many ways it brings my life and career full circle.
It has everything to do with one day in a field in southwest Georgia when I was 9 years old. I was supposed to be picking cotton. Instead, I was distracted thinking how in the world this green plant could create this fluffy white ball. That was the day I started on the path to becoming an agronomist. That path led to degrees from Fort Valley State College and the universities of Georgia and Missouri and to a 34-year faculty career at the University of Minnesota.
The land-grant mission is in my blood, and I am a proud product of it. And as chancellor at Illinois, one of the original land-grants established by the Morrill Act, I have the opportunity to help ensure that my experience is one that any student can have in this century of higher education.
We need to find ways to make that story possible for everyone – no matter where they start, what their parents do, or how fast the technological, economic and political changes come at us. And we need to find ways to make that story one that isn’t limited to four or five years of life, but to the educational needs of a whole lifetime.
It’s perfect timing as we begin the sesquicentennial year at Illinois that we turn our focus on our own academic future. In a time of financial uncertainties and demands for greater accountability, and when questions around social equity and social justice are forcing fundamental reevaluations of everything from our admission policies to our investment strategies, we have an opportunity to demonstrate different paths forward.
We have to respond to the realities on the ground here – but no one says we have to do so in ways that are expected or “status quo.” This is a time for educational innovation. And this is a place that knows more about innovation and invention than any other.
I know I have plenty to learn and I am excited to be here and to get started. In keeping with the 150-year milestone Illinois will begin celebrating in February, I am spending my first 150 days here on what I’m calling my “Shaping the Future” tour at Illinois. I’ll be out meeting you, the students, faculty, staff and alumni and listening to what you believe makes this a great university today and how we can ensure that excellence continues for another century.
Together, we have the opportunity to redefine what the world can and should expect from a great public research university.
I’m excited to get started and I look forward to all that we will achieve together.
Best wishes,
Robert J. Jones Chancellor"

Last night, Robbie M. Patton turned himself in to the Champaign County Jail. He remains in custody this morning and is expected to be arraigned this afternoon on charges of murder and aggravated battery with a firearm for his alleged role in the Sept. 25 shooting in the 300 block of East Green Street, Champaign.
More information is available from the Champaign Police Department: (http://ci.champaign.il.us/2016/09/29/arrest-made-in-september-25-shooting-investigation/). The investigation is ongoing, as Champaign Police detectives continue to search for information on those involved in the events which led to the shooting. Anyone who witnessed the event or has additional information is asked to contact the Champaign Police Department at police@champaignil.gov or 217-351-4545. We will continue to issue updates on social media and through the news media as significant developments occur.
An arrest alone cannot ever repair the trauma experienced by the victims of this tragic event, and particularly that of Mr. Korchev's family and friends, but we hope this serves as some assurance that authorities are working toward a resolution. We ask that our community members continue to support one another, and we thank you again for being an important part of the safety of our campus and surrounding area.

We would like to provide you with an update regarding the Champaign Police Department’s investigation into a shooting which occurred early in the morning on Sept. 25 in the 300 block of East Green Street. Today, local law enforcement agencies announced they are looking for Robbie M. Patton, 18, of Champaign, who is wanted for murder and aggravated battery with a firearm in connection with Sunday’s incident.
You can follow this link for more information and ongoing updates from the Champaign Police Department: http://bit.ly/2d4lDN6. We will continue to issue updates via email when there are significant developments.
The Champaign Police Department is also asking anyone who was in the immediate vicinity of the incident on Sunday morning to contact detectives at police@champaignil.gov or 217-351-4545. Witness observations, cellphone video or any other information may be valuable to the ongoing investigation.
Our thoughts remain with Mr. Korchev’s family and friends, the other victims of the shooting and many others who have been affected directly or indirectly by this tragedy. We have a large community and a big campus, but it is a community that addresses challenges together. We truly have a tight-knit Illinois family. It is important that we support each other, help each other heal and make it loud and clear that we do not tolerate this kind of violence in our community. That was evident at last night’s student-led vigil. Between the words of the speakers and the unity I observed, I was personally moved and thank everyone who participated in person or in spirit.
I am also thankful for the intense partnerships we have in our community. Through initiatives like the Champaign Community Coalition, as well as our work with neighboring law enforcement agencies through the Street Crimes Task Force, and through the C-U Fresh Start initiative which addresses the social issues associated with violence, I am confident we have prevented similar incidents of gun violence. I do not want to lose focus on these initiatives, because I think it is through this kind of community-oriented work that we can continue to make progress.
The safety and support of our community is a responsibility that everyone must be willing to take on. Thank you for stepping up and fulfilling that role.

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This Campus Safety Notice is issued in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about crime to aid in the prevention of similar crimes and to assist in the identification of offenders.
This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, please visit CrimeReports.com, download the Campus Safety guide through the Illinois Student Affairs app, or visit the University of Illinois Police Department to view the daily crime log.
The following burglary took place between 2:02 p.m. and 2:12 p.m. on Monday, September 26, 2016, in multiple rooms in Trelease Hall, 901 W. College Court (map) in Urbana.
The offenders, who do not appear to be residents of Trelease Hall, entered the building by following closely behind students who had just entered by swiping their student IDs. The offenders entered several student rooms, which had been left unlocked and unattended, and took various electronic items.
You can view images of the suspects by following this link: http://illinois.edu/lb/article/2668/98824/
The University of Illinois Police Department has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area, and we are fortunate to have our force supplemented by the Urbana and Champaign police departments. Between these agencies, the Urbana campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 1,000 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS) or by visiting www.373tips.com. Anonymous tips may also be sent via text message by texting keyword ""CCTIP"" plus the information to 274637 (CRIMES).
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Watch your stuff. Theft is the most common crime on college campuses everywhere, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is no exception. Lock up or secure your personal belongings whenever possible, even if they are sitting right next to you.
Lock your doors. The easiest way to prevent theft and burglary is by locking the door to your vehicle or residence. Criminals often will look for an open door or window to steal your items.
Bring it with you. If you’re leaving campus for an extended period of time, bring your valuables with you. During school breaks, criminals will take advantage of an empty campus.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.

As you have probably heard by now, what began last night as a confrontation between two individuals at a party several blocks from the edge of campus escalated into gunfire that took the life of a visitor to the community. Several others, including a student and a staff member, were injured. Authorities are still searching for the shooter. As the incidents were not on the campus, the Champaign Police Department is leading the investigation.
Champaign Mayor Deborah Frank Feinen and I have communicated and she has made it clear that the safety of the entire community is the top priority and that the investigation is proceeding with assistance from officers from Urbana, Champaign County and our own University of Illinois Police Department (UIPD).
If you feel you need immediate counseling support you can call the Crisis Line at 217-359-4141. The Student Assistance Center (217-333-0050) will also have professional staff available beginning Monday morning for students and staff who want to talk to someone. And the Illinois Student Senate will hold a public vigil on Tuesday evening at 7:00 p.m. on Anniversary Plaza south of the Illini Union in support of the victims.
The UIPD sent a message this morning (http://illinois.edu/lb/article/2668/98803) with information detailing what authorities know regarding the timeline and locations of events and asking for any information community members can provide to help identify and arrest those responsible. I encourage you all to read it if you have not. Incidents like these often give birth to rumors and misinformation that make it more difficult for authorities to solve these crimes and more difficult for the community affected to begin to heal in the aftermath.
And today we need to come together to help those who have been harmed to start that healing.
A life has been taken. Four others have had their own forever changed. The families and friends who know them are shaken. None of these victims was even involved in the incident or attended the party that started it all. They were bystanders caught in a senseless act of violence.
We can all understand the grief and shock of those who knew the young man killed last night and the pain and fear of the others who were injured. We can offer them our support, our sympathy and our compassion.
I ask all of us to be there for those in our family who need us on sad days like this one.

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area and which police are now investigating.
This morning, at approximately 12:38 a.m., police responded to the 300 block of East Green Street, Champaign, after receiving multiple reports of shots fired. When they arrived, officers found four people who had been hit by gunfire and another person who was struck by a vehicle while running from the area. One person, a 22-year-old man who is not a university student, died from his injuries after being transported to the hospital. The other victims sustained non-life-threatening injuries.
Preliminary investigation suggests that an argument took place during an apartment party. The argument transitioned outside, where a fight broke out and shots were fired. The victims, one of whom is a university student, were not involved in the fight.
About 30 minutes later, at 1:08 a.m., police received another report of gunfire in the 700 block of South State Street, Champaign. Upon arrival, officers found a victim who was transported to an area hospital with a non-life-threatening gunshot wound. Investigators believe the two incidents may be related.
Police continue to look for those involved in the shooting incidents, as well as the driver involved in the vehicle accident. The Champaign Police Department is leading the investigation, and the University of Illinois Police Department, Champaign County Sheriff’s Department and Champaign County Coroner are assisting to process the scene, review security camera footage and interview potential witnesses. Anyone who was at the party or who may have witnessed any of these incidents is urged to contact the Champaign Police Investigations Division at police@champaignil.gov or 217-351-4545.
Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS) or by visiting www.373tips.com. Anonymous tips may also be sent via text message by texting keyword ""CCTIP"" plus the information to 274637 (CRIMES). Calls or messages sent to Crime Stoppers are scrubbed of identifying information and are answered by a third-party service, not the police.
Additional details will be released as the investigation proceeds.
Law enforcement agencies are working hard to find the person or people responsible for these crimes. The Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs is providing support to the student who was injured and will provide counseling to any students who want to talk to someone in the coming days. Our campus community is a strong one, and our thoughts are with the victims, their families and anyone else affected by this violence.
Sincerely,

Dear colleagues:
Today, I am delighted to welcome Robert Jones as the new permanent chancellor of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and to welcome former Interim Chancellor Barbara Wilson to a newly restructured leadership role with the U of I System.
Both are as eager to get started as we are to have them.
Robert is joining us a week earlier than expected when his appointment was announced in July, after wrapping up his work at the University of Albany, State University of New York (SUNY), where he served for three years as president of one of the SUNY system’s leading research universities. After passing the baton to Robert, Barb is moving immediately into her new System-wide position as executive vice president and vice president for academic affairs.
Robert is new to Illinois, but certainly not to the bedrock missions that have made the U of I a world leader since its land-grant founding nearly 150 years ago. He brings a deep passion for students and innovation, and a long record of achievement as an educator, researcher and top administrator in public higher education, including more than three decades at the University of Minnesota, a fellow Big Ten land-grant institution.
Barb has been a familiar face in Urbana-Champaign since 2000, serving as a faculty member, executive vice provost and dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. For the last 13 months, she served as interim chancellor, where her commitment and leadership were invaluable in steering the university through a year of difficult challenges. Barb will now bring those same skills to help guide the System forward in her new role as senior operating officer, senior academic officer and second-in-command to the president.
I hope you will join me in welcoming Robert and Barb, and thanking Assistant Vice President for Academic Affairs Marilyn M.M. Marshall for stepping up to serve as interim vice president for academic affairs for the last month.
Sincerely,
Tim"

This is a massmail that was sent this morning to all Illinois students. It gives the results of the survey we conducted in the Fall of 2015 on sexual misconduct. In the massmail, there is a link directly to the results of the survey which is being kept on the WeCare website. You are welcome to review the results.
You'll see in the massmail that I tell students we all need to work together on the problem of sexual misconduct on our campus. Faculty and staff can review the WeCare website so that you're prepared to direct students to resources, depending on how they want to move forward.
I know you share my concern and will do what you can to help. Thanks for everything you do for students.
 
Message sent to students 9/21/2016
Dear Students:
Sexual misconduct is prevalent in our society and the University of Illinois is not immune. We are committed to doing all we can at Illinois to make the campus safer - both reducing the incidents of sexual misconduct and providing support to victims. But to do that effectively, we needed your help.  Last fall, we asked each of you, through your anonymous participation in a Sexual Misconduct and Perceived Campus Response survey, to tell us about your experiences in classrooms, residence halls, apartments, the library, bars, restaurants and everywhere in the community.
By understanding what is happening and how you believe and expect the University will respond, we can better address this critical issue and ensure that you have the best experience possible as an Illinois student.
The full report of the survey findings is available at http://www.wecare.illinois.edu/reports/. I encourage you to take a look and to read what your classmates had to say.
The report is extensive and includes much more in-depth data and explanation, but here are some key things you told us:
You tell your friends or family, not necessarily University authorities, of sexual misconduct. From this we have learned that we need to increase efforts to help you, your teachers, all our employees and your parents learn about the resources available to help, so you know that we are committed to supporting you.
You understand that we will respect your privacy and keep reports of sexual misconduct confidential.
You are fairly confident that the University will handle incidents appropriately. Programs such as FYCARE, Bystander Intervention, the WeCare website and other promotional materials must be continued and enhanced.
Although being under the influence of alcohol is not an excuse or reason for sexual misconduct, we know from your responses that there is a relationship between the misuse of alcohol and sexual misconduct. We will use this information to help you better understand this relationship and the dangers of being under the influence of alcohol in certain settings.
We greatly appreciate the time many of you took to share your experiences. More than 2,500 of our 44,000 students took the survey, and the respondents reflect current student demographics. All of us who work for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are committed to continuing efforts to understand your student experiences with sexual misconduct here and doing whatever we can to prevent and to respond to sexual misconduct on campus. As a part of this effort, we will conduct another campus climate survey in February of 2017 and will hold focus groups to explore more ways to improve our response to survivors.
We need to help students look out for each other, intervene when they see a potential problem occurring, and help friends and family seek assistance when someone they know feels that they have been the victim of sexual misconduct.
Together, we can all make, and we must, make a difference.
Sincerely,
Dr. C. Renée RomanoVice Chancellor for Student Affairs"

Dear colleagues:
I am pleased to announce that Barb Wilson has agreed to serve as executive vice president and vice president for academic affairs for the University of Illinois System, pending Board of Trustees approval. In the newly restructured role, Barb will serve as second-in-command to the president, with responsibilities as the System’s chief operating officer as well as chief academic officer. A news release announcing her appointment is included here.
Barb’s work as interim chancellor and in her 16 years as a faculty member and administrator in Urbana-Champaign have been exemplary, and I am delighted that will she will now share her talents to help guide the U of I System as a whole.
She will assume her new role on Sept. 26, and I hope you will join me in welcoming her to this exciting new chapter in her career.
Sincerely,
Tim
Barbara J. Wilson named to U of I System executive vice president post 
New second-in-command role will also coordinate System’s academic, budgetary operations
URBANA – Interim University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Chancellor Barbara J. Wilson has been named executive vice president and vice president for academic affairs of the three-university U of I System, President Tim Killeen announced Monday.
Killeen said Wilson’s appointment, subject to Board of Trustees approval, fills a newly restructured role that establishes a clear second-in-command to the president, and adds responsibilities as senior operating officer to traditional duties as chief academic officer.
In her new role, Wilson also will work closely with Killeen to advocate for the U of I System and elevate its national profile by building on connections with legislators, funding agencies and leaders in higher education, communities and industry.
“Barb’s leadership, passion and vision have been invaluable in steering the university through a turbulent year with its excellence intact,” Killeen said. “I am delighted that she will now share her many talents to serve the entire U of I System, and elevate our standing as a global leader in education, innovation and service to the public good.”
Wilson, a faculty member and administrator in Urbana-Champaign since 2000, will assume her new duties Sept. 26, serving in a designate capacity pending approval by trustees at their Nov. 10 meeting in Chicago.
“The challenges facing the entire U of I System and public higher education are going to require us to make decisions together that will impact the university for generations to come,” Wilson said. “I hope my perspective both as a long-time faculty member and as a campus administrator will help us make choices that foster academic excellence as well as sound stewardship of our resources. I know I have a lot to learn and I’m looking forward to getting started.”
In the newly created role of executive vice president, Wilson will serve as second-in-command to the president and senior operating officer for a $5.6 billion U of I higher education and health care system with universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield. Major responsibilities will include the coordination of planning and budgeting across the System.
As vice president for academic affairs, Wilson will serve as the System’s senior academic officer, collaborating with campus chancellors, provosts, faculty and academic staff on educational and student programs. In that role, she replaces former Vice President for Academic Affairs Christophe Pierre, who resigned last month to become provost of the Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey.
Wilson, 58, has served as interim chancellor in Urbana-Champaign since August 2015, following the resignation of former Chancellor Phyllis Wise. In July, trustees approved a new permanent chancellor – Robert J. Jones, president of the State University of New York at Albany, who takes office Sept. 26.
As interim chancellor, Wilson helped the university weather significant reductions in state funding during an ongoing state budget impasse. Despite the financial shortfall, enrollment continued to grow, including a record freshman class for the fall semester. She also helped lead efforts that brought in Josh Whitman as athletics director, Lovie Smith as head football coach and King Li as the inaugural dean of the Carle Illinois College of Medicine. Her leadership also played a key role in developing a new Strategic Framework that will guide the U of I System’s growth for the next decade. 
Wilson joined the Urbana-Champaign faculty in 2000 and became the Harry E. Preble Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (LAS) in 2014. She retained her title as dean while serving as interim chancellor, but will leave the post when she takes her new position. Executive Associate Dean Brian Ross led LAS over the last year and will continue in that role during the transition.
Before becoming dean, she had served since 2009 in the Office of the Provost. Her service there included two years as executive vice provost for faculty and academic affairs, with a leadership role in campus strategic and financial planning.
A professor of communication who was a member of the faculty at the University of California at Santa Barbara for 12 years, Wilson is an elected fellow of the International Communication Association. A three-degree alumna of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Wilson earned a bachelor’s degree in journalism and her master’s degree and Ph.D in communication.
An internal search to fill the new vice presidency was launched in July, assisted by an advisory committee chaired by University of Illinois at Chicago Chancellor Michael Amiridis. The search yielded eight applicants and Killeen interviewed two finalists for the position."

In order to maintain an effective emergency response and evacuation plan, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign recently completed a test including two components: an exercise and a drill. The test was designed to challenge our emergency response procedures and how we notify you of a threat to our campus community.
For the first part of the test, university personnel and emergency responders from a number of local agencies gathered for a functional exercise on Sept. 2 from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Illinois Fire Service Institute. The exercise was unannounced, and those involved were presented with a scenario involving a civil disturbance that directly affected campus. The exercise tested various components of the Campus Emergency Operations Plan, including evacuation procedures.
The second component was a drill for which we initiated a test of our Illini-Alert emergency notification system on Sept. 6 at 10:05 a.m. The drill was announced ahead of time by a mass email to campus and an E-Week notice sent to faculty and staff. The Illini-Alert system sent an email to the campus email addresses of all active faculty, staff and students. Those who have registered alternate email addresses also received a notification. Those who have registered a cellphone number were sent a text message during this drill.
Illini-Alert messages are also posted to Facebook and Twitter and on campus websites through our Emergency Web Alert System. This multi-modal approach increases the speed and breadth of our distribution of emergency notifications, and it provides a robust communication engine that will continue to function successfully even if one system fails to work properly.

We are delighted to announce that we have selected Dr. King Li of Wake Forest University to be the inaugural dean and chief academic officer of the Carle Illinois College of Medicine. Dr. Li’s tenure will begin October 1, pending his departure from Wake Forest and approval by the University of Illinois Board of Trustees.
Dr. Li is currently the senior associate dean for clinical and translational research at Wake Forest School of Medicine and the deputy director of that university’s comprehensive cancer center.
Dr. Li, who holds M.D. and MBA degrees, is a renowned researcher, educator, inventor and clinician in molecular imaging and radiology. He holds 16 patents, with another six pending, and is the Wells Fargo Faculty Scholar at Wake Forest, established for the recruitment of faculty whose research shows promise for generating significant intellectual property and commercialization.
He has a deep knowledge of all facets of the Carle Illinois College of Medicine concept, particularly its engineering-based foundation and public-private structure, and he is a highly regarded scholar who commands respect in his discipline and in the medical profession. Equally important, he is excited about engaging faculty, disciplines and colleges across the campus as well as physician colleagues in the Carle system and beyond to successfully lead this new college.
Dr. Li’s experience includes research, clinical, educational and entrepreneurial roles at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center and Stanford University, as well as Wake Forest and Houston Methodist Hospital. He earned a medical degree from University of Toronto and an MBA from San Jose State University.
We were fortunate to consider the applications of a number of outstanding candidates nationally and beyond, and the committee chose Dr. Li because he possesses the academic, clinical and technical skills – along with the personal attributes – to lead the Carle Illinois College of Medicine and to galvanize public support.
As we create the first new college at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 60 years, we have tremendous confidence in Dr. Li as its founding dean. He brings to the role a superb combination of scholarly accomplishment, administrative experience and diverse experience at outstanding research and health sciences institutions. We look forward to working with him as he leads the highly innovative Carle Illinois College of Medicine.
Best wishes,

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes.
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes. We are not including certain details in this alert so as to avoid releasing identifying information about the victim.
The University of Illinois Police Department has received information from a Campus Security Authority that a student reported she was sexually assaulted during the evening hours of Thursday, August 25, 2016 at a fraternity house on South First Street in Champaign by a person unknown to the victim.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS) or by visiting www.373tips.com. Anonymous tips may also be sent via text message by texting keyword ""CCTIP"" plus the information to 274637 (CRIMES).
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.
If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another person, intervene if it’s safe to do so or call for assistance.
While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. For more information about reporting rape, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.
Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person.

Dear students:
I am delighted to welcome you to our 2016-17 academic year on behalf of the University of Illinois System.
You may not realize it, but you are part of a bigger family that stretches far beyond the universities you call home. The U of I System touches literally every corner of our state, through its three universities in Chicago, Springfield and Urbana-Champaign; regional campuses in Peoria, Rockford and the Quad Cities; a major health education and clinical enterprise; and an Extension network that takes our scholarship into every county.
Our global reputation for excellence, outstanding faculty and rich culture of diversity attract top students from around the world. This fall, System-wide enrollment could again top 80,000 students, perhaps eclipsing last fall’s record and more than the population of Illinois’ 12th largest city, Bloomington.
The U of I System continues to flourish despite uncertainty over state funding, thanks to ongoing cost-saving efforts that put the needs of our students first. Students are the very core of our mission and my presidency is dedicated to all of you. Leadership, faculty and staff across the System will work to ensure an educational experience that transforms lives and provides a degree that is forever synonymous with pride, respect and opportunity.
In fact, we are committed to exceed the high expectations that brought you here, through a new System-wide Strategic Framework that will serve as our roadmap to an even brighter tomorrow. It sets ambitious goals to better serve you – in our classrooms and through programs that have already pushed our completion rates above national averages and driven strong career opportunities for our students.
I am grateful for the trust you have placed in us, and hope you take advantage of everything the University System has to offer, in your studies and beyond. What you learn here will serve you for a lifetime. Enjoy the ride, and don’t forget to have some fun along the way.
I wish you all the best and I thank you and your family for choosing the University of Illinois.
Sincerely,Tim"

Look out of any window on campus and it is clear that our 149th academic year here at Illinois is off to a great start. Last Friday’s Convocation ceremony officially welcomed our new undergraduates to the beginning of their Illinois experience. That experience is one that will be shaped by all of you – the members of our community who will teach, advise, mentor and watch out for all those undergraduate and graduate students who choose to call Illinois home. I know from my own experiences working with you that our students are in very, very good hands.
I thought you might be interested to see the welcome message I sent to our students Monday morning. The text is pasted below.
I wish you all a great year.

Monday's Welcome Message to Students
Dear Students,
Welcome to a new academic year at Illinois! Whether this is your first semester, the opening week of your graduation year or the start of your graduate studies, we’re very happy to have you here. When you’re away the campus and our entire community just don’t feel the same. An empty Quad might be a great photo opportunity, but it doesn’t represent the real personality and spirit of the university.
Our character and our vitality come directly from all of you.  We’re at our best when hallways are crowded, sidewalks are filled and you are all out exploring everything Illinois has to offer. Questions, debates and even an argument or two along the way are welcome sounds to us. And I challenge each of you this year to reach out to two or three people you don’t know and make real connections with them. That’s how the best ideas are shaped and new discoveries are made. In truth, we actually get a little nervous when things get too quiet. Open dialogue also leads to new perspectives, unexpected collaborations and a surprising number of new friendships.
It’s great to have you all back and I wish you a productive, safe and fun new year, in and out of the classroom. Thanks for making some very welcome noise here at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign."

Dear Students,
Welcome to campus and the first week of the Fall 2016 semester!
In case your schedule is not yet settled, I’m writing to let you know there are still some openings in our new 200-level Critical Frameworks courses, each of which meets at least two Gen Ed requirements. These courses have no prerequisites and are ideal for sophomores and above (including transfer students!).  We’ve assembled some of the best teachers from all over campus to teach these unique courses on Health, Inequality, or Sustainability—topics students like you are passionate about.
GCL 210: Frameworks for Sustainability, Energy & the Environment2 Gen Eds: Humanities & the Arts/Cultural Studies 
GCL 220: Frameworks for Building Healthy Communities2 Gen Eds: Humanities & the Arts/Cultural Studies 
GCL 200/201*: Frameworks for Inequality & Cultural Understanding2 Gen Eds: Humanities & the Arts/US Minority Cultures (LIMITED SPACE)(*GCL 201 also meets Advanced Composition – LIMITED SPACE)
The Frameworks courses will put you in conversation with award-winning faculty in the arts, sciences, social sciences, humanities, business, and engineering. Each Frameworks course meets twice per week: first for a lecture that gathers all students and faculty, and next in small seminars. Through this innovative structure, you’ll benefit from the expertise of several faculty while working closely with your professor and a network of peers. You’ll meet interesting students, hear great lectures, and participate in group projects that you can publish in your own electronic portfolio.
Click on the above links to Course Explorer and see which Frameworks course fits your interests and schedule! You can also watch our short video, visit our webpage, talk to your advisor, or email Professor Lauren Goodlad at  lgoodad@illinois.edu.
Best wishes for a successful academic year.

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes.
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes. We are not including certain details in this alert so as to avoid releasing identifying information about the victim.
The University of Illinois Police Department on Monday received a report from a Campus Security Authority that a student was sexually assaulted at 11 p.m. on Wednesday, August 17, 2016, at an apartment in the 700 block of South Gregory Place, Urbana, by a person known to the victim.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to assist those involved in this incident and will continue to take actions to maintain the safety and security of the campus community.
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.
If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another person, intervene if it’s safe to do so or call for assistance.
While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. 
Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.
It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves.

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This Campus Safety Notice is issued in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about crime to aid in the prevention of similar crimes and to assist in the identification of offenders.
This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, download the Campus Safety Mobile Guide or visit the University of Illinois Police Department to view the daily crime log.
The University of Illinois Police Department was informed on Monday of two attempted robberies:
The Champaign Police Department informed the University of Illinois Police Department that a U. of I. student was approached around 8:45 p.m. Sunday, Aug. 14, on the sidewalk near Sixth Street and Springfield Avenue, Champaign (map), by three males. One of the offenders demanded money. The offenders made no indication that they had a weapon. The student took defensive action and the offenders fled on bicycles. Nothing was taken, and the student was unharmed.
A U. of I. student reported Monday that he was approached by three males on bicycles sometime around 8:45 p.m. Sunday, Aug. 14, while the student sat in a parked car near Coler Avenue and Main Street, Urbana (map). One of the offenders demanded money. When the student refused and motioned to call for help, one offender suggested it was a joke and all three rode away. Nothing was taken, and the student was unharmed. The three offenders appeared to be younger than college age.
These incidents are separate from the attempted robbery detailed in a Campus Safety Notice issued Sunday, but it is believed that the offenders in all three cases are the same people. Video footage of the individuals suspected to be involved in the incident of which you were informed last night can be viewed on the University of Illinois Police Department website.
The University of Illinois Police Department has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area, and we are fortunate to have our force supplemented by the Urbana and Champaign police departments. Between these agencies, the Urbana campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 1,000 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS) or by visiting www.373tips.com. Anonymous tips may also be sent via text message by texting keyword ""CCTIP"" plus the information to 274637 (CRIMES).
This is our community. Let's stay together.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I.

Dear colleagues:
I write to update you on the status of a 2016-17 salary program for University of Illinois faculty and staff.
Finding a way to provide a merit-based salary program to reward employees for their hard work and dedication has been the subject of extensive discussions among leadership at the system and university levels. This is especially important on the heels of a state budget impasse that prevented a salary program for the 2015-16 academic year.
Unfortunately, the budget stalemate in Springfield remains unresolved; following two partial “stopgap” appropriations, the state still does not have a full-year budget for the 2017 fiscal year that started July 1. This leaves us with uncertainty over funding that again makes a salary program fiscally imprudent at this time. As responsible stewards of the University’s future, we must be careful about committing to ongoing, increased expenses while our long-term financial picture is unclear.
Therefore, we will defer consideration of a salary program for now, and will continue to pursue efficiencies and cost savings that hopefully will allow us to implement a modest program in fiscal 2017. In the meantime, academic appointments for 2016-17 will be presented to the Board of Trustees in September at current salary levels.
Be assured that employee compensation is among our highest priorities. We will continue to advocate at every turn for appropriations that support our faculty and staff, our academic and research programs, and our rich legacy of service to students and the public good.
Those efforts have been underway since before the impasse began and there are signs our message is resonating. Though agreement on a full state budget remains elusive, elected officials in Springfield have demonstrated their awareness and support of public higher education among a select group of essential services that they deem critical to our state.
I fully recognize the hardships that our faculty and staff face with no salary program, and I am deeply grateful for your understanding and continued commitment to excellence during this difficult time.
Sincerely,Tim"

An excessive heat watch remains in effect through Saturday evening with heat index values forecast in excess of 105 degrees.  
During this period, energy conservation efforts should be maximized, especially from the hours of 2:00 – 6:00 p.m., as energy usage is expected to establish new peak levels across the Midwest regional grid.
As a participant in the electric market, the university's yearly utility rates include a capacity charge based on usage at the moment of the peak demand load.
Here is how you can help Beat the Peak:  Turn off lights when possible  Close windows in conditioned areas Unplug non-essential equipment Shut down computers/printers when not in use Adjust thermostats to a more efficient setting Turn off window AC units in unused spaces  Close fume hood sashes when not in use More energy conservation tips are available from the Energy Conservation Incentive Program: http://go.fs.illinois.edu/energytips.

Dear colleagues,
I am delighted to announce that I have recommended Dr. Robert J. Jones as the new chancellor for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, pending approval by the Board of Trustees. Dr. Jones currently serves as the president of the University at Albany, State University of New York (SUNY), one of the SUNY system’s leading research universities. He is an experienced and accomplished scientist and research university leader.
Dr. Jones has been at the helm of UAlbany since 2013. His tenure there follows a 34-year career at the University of Minnesota, a Big Ten land-grant institution where he began as a faculty agronomist and rose through a series of academic administrative appointments, serving as senior vice president for academic administration at the University of Minnesota System from 2004 to 2013.
He is a native of Georgia, and he earned a bachelor’s degree in agronomy from Fort Valley State College, a master’s degree in crop physiology from the University of Georgia and a doctorate in crop physiology from the University of Missouri, Columbia. He began his academic career as a faculty member at Minnesota and became an internationally respected authority on plant physiology. He is a fellow of the American Society of Agronomy and the Crop Science Society of America.
Dr. Jones would be the first African-American appointed Urbana chancellor since the office was created in 1967. Please visit go.uillinois.edu/2016Chancellor to read more about him.

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes.
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes. We are not including certain details in this alert so as to avoid releasing identifying information about the victim.
The University of Illinois Police Department received a report from a Campus Security Authority Monday evening that a student was sexually abused during the early morning on Friday, July 15, in a Champaign residence hall by a person known to the victim.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to assist those involved in this incident and will continue to take actions to maintain the safety and security of the campus community.
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.
If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another person, intervene if it’s safe to do so or call for assistance.
While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. For more information about reporting rape, please visit wecare.llinois.edu.
Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.
It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves.

I am very pleased to announce that Professor Assata Zerai has accepted the position of Associate Chancellor for Diversity pending approval by the Board of Trustees. She will begin this new role in the Office of the Chancellor on August 16. Professor Zerai’s faculty home is the Department of Sociology and she currently serves as associate dean in the Graduate College and as the director of the Center for African Studies.
Professor Zerai is an accomplished scholar whose interdisciplinary research focuses on strategies for promoting the voices of marginalized groups and improving inclusion. Professor Zerai has demonstrated a career-long commitment to diversity initiatives and an ability to foster constructive dialogue, build trust, and establish ongoing communication structures to enhance partnerships.  In 2015, she was recognized for her campus work as a recipient of the Larine Y. Cowan “Make a Difference Award for Leadership in Diversity.”
In her new role, Professor Zerai will work collaboratively with faculty, staff, students, community groups, and the Office of the Provost to develop and lead a comprehensive and actionable campus diversity strategy for the campus. I am confident that Professor Zerai will provide dynamic leadership across and beyond the university community to further our diversity, equity, and inclusion missions. 
I am grateful to the search committee, chaired by Professor Kevin Hamilton, for identifying a very strong pool of candidates.
Please join me in congratulating Assata Zerai on her new role!

Dear colleagues:
Yesterday, legislators and the governor agreed upon legislation for an initial fiscal 2017 spending plan that will fund higher education, K-12 schools and other essential state services through December.
We are grateful for their hard work and bipartisan compromise, which will improve the University’s financial outlook – providing much welcomed funding and temporarily resolving a year-long budget impasse in Springfield.
I am also deeply grateful to everyone in the University of Illinois family who has stepped up over the last year to advocate on our behalf. Students, faculty, staff, alumni and our Board of Trustees have traveled to Springfield to meet personally with legislators. More than 1,200 supporters responded to a call to action last month, sending over 3,500 emails telling their stories about the University’s importance in their lives and to the future of our state. Our U of I Legislative Caucus also has come through for us. All of these contributions have been impactful.
Under the agreement, the University of Illinois system will receive an appropriation of about $350 million for fiscal year 2017, which begins today, about 55 percent of the nearly $650 million we received in our state appropriation for fiscal year 2015. The funds may be used to pay obligations for both fiscal 2016 and 2017. In addition, the measure also funds MAP financial aid grants that students received for last spring’s semester.
The appropriation will provide critical support for our students, our faculty and staff, our world-class academic and research programs, our Chicago health-care enterprise and our Urbana-based state research institutes. It represents a significant step in the right direction, and for now defers the need for layoffs and other austerity measures that could have had an irreversible impact on our core missions and our global standing.
The short-term spending plan is a milepost, but does not bring us to the finish line.  We will continue to advocate for a full fiscal 2016 and 2017 state budget to support our excellence and ensure the long-term stability that is crucial to plan our future. At the same time, we will continue to make our case for future MAP funding to support our most vulnerable students, affordable health-care for our employees and solutions to protect the retirement benefits they have earned.
We also will continue to apply the lessons we have learned through a year of self-examination and self-assessment – hard and ongoing work that has helped us operate more efficiently and effectively, and sharpened our focus on marshaling resources to serve our students and the public good.
Despite our challenges over the last year, the University of Illinois system has remained a go-to destination for students and a world leader in education and innovation. We have held our place because of you, and I can’t thank you enough for your patience, your commitment, your creativity and your passion for this great university.
Sincerely,
Tim"

We are pleased to announce that on June 20th, the University launched an enhanced version of the myResearch Portal. To access the myResearch Portal, please go to: https://myresearch.uillinois.edu/piPortal/
The launch of the myResearch Portal parallels the University’s transition from UIeRA (InfoEd) to myProposals (Kuali Coeus).  myResearch Portal will be the campus’ sole tool for accessing status data relative to proposals and awards. 
We will continue to work on design and implementation of the capability for electronic proposal submission within myProposals (Kuali Coeus), allowing the campus access to myProposals (Kuali Coeus).
This release of the myResearch Portal features a completely new design and layout, an enhanced search function, and improved reporting/data export tools. This release is an important step toward an integrated electronic research administration system. As we continue to evolve the myResearch Portal, we encourage your feedback on the redesigned interface and additional data needs.  The myResearch Portal should address most reporting needs.  In addition, there will be reports available in EDDIE after June 20. 
If you currently have access to the myResearch Portal and EDDIE, your access will remain.  If you do not have access to your department please have your USC submit a request through the AITS Security Application. If you are a Business Manager, your USC should request the Business Manager profile under the myResearch tab. If you also need access to the myProposals EDDIE reports, your USC should request the myProposals EDDIE Reports under the myResearch tab.

Dear colleagues:We were heartened and not at all surprised by the response to a system-wide message sent last week on the prospect of another fiscal year with no state budget.
Our supporters stepped up to ask how they could directly express their concerns to elected officials in Springfield, including one who pointed to the power that the University community holds as advocates. “Please, keep in mind that you have a network the size of which rivals a small army,” he wrote, alluding to our 80,000 students, 25,000 employees and 700,000 alumni around the world.
Our global network also has an outlet to let their voices be heard – through Illinois Connection, a grassroots advocacy organization that has grown to more than 15,000 members since it was founded by the University of Illinois Alumni Association.
By visiting the Illinois Connection website, you will be linked to contact information for the governor and your local legislators, allowing you to share your stories about what the University of Illinois means to you and its key role in driving progress for our state. For state and University employees, it is best practice to use your personal phone or email and to contact elected officials outside working hours or during scheduled breaks.
We encourage you to join our chorus, urging approval of state budgets to fund our public universities for both fiscal 2016 and 2017. Your voices matter. You are voters, not just advocates, and each of you can speak first-hand to the value of higher education – the difference it has made in your life and how it fosters the 21st century workforce and discovery that will move Illinois forward.
Thank you for your support, and for your loyalty and commitment to this great University.

Dear colleagues:
The General Assembly yesterday adjourned for the second straight year without reaching agreement with the governor on funding to support the University of Illinois system and public higher education across our state. These consecutive failures in Springfield are unprecedented in Illinois history.
Gov. Bruce Rauner and legislative leaders have pledged to continue negotiations, but I am gravely concerned about the implications for our students, our faculty and staff and our campuses if we are forced to weather another protracted period without adequate funding from the state.
This great university system is not in danger of shutting its doors, but a crisis is worsening nonetheless.
We are now 11 months into fiscal 2016 with only stopgap funding that will provide about a quarter of the nearly $650 million in state funding that we received the year before. Now, we face the prospect of a new fiscal year with no state support.
To date, we have weathered the shortfall responsibly through significant cost-saving initiatives, structural reforms and prudent financial management. But we cannot withstand a continued loss of state funding without considerable damage to our core missions – teaching, research, public service and economic development.
All options are on the table as we go forward – layoffs, reductions of academic programs, closure of units and cuts in a health-care enterprise that provides critical care to underserved populations in Chicago. All would damage the very core of our mission to serve students and the public good, and erode a rich, 150-year legacy of academic excellence and economic impact that would be far more costly to rebuild than sustain.
We will continue to do everything in our power to preserve the world-class quality that is synonymous with the University of Illinois, ramping up efforts that have been underway for well over a year to advocate at every turn for the interests of our students, our employees and the people and families of Illinois. I hope all of you will join us, and I will update you as the budget process unfolds.
Sincerely,Tim"

At last week’s University of Illinois Board of Trustees (BOT) meeting, President Tim Killeen reiterated the foundational importance of academic freedom to our institution. He noted that academic freedom is embedded in the new University of Illinois system strategic framework and protected by the University Statutes. Importantly, our institutional commitment to and protections of academic freedom are consistent with the AAUP’s 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure. We share President Killeen’s commitment to academic freedom and appreciate his reiteration of these core principles.
Over the past 18 months, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has taken several steps to strengthen our hiring practices. We created a faculty committee to review our policies and procedures and have worked with the Academic Senate, additional faculty leaders and the Council of Deans to revise our processes and underscore our shared understanding of the critical role that academic freedom plays in supporting the mission of a world-class university. We also consulted with the local and national AAUP on the steps we were taking.
Today we have hiring procedures that facilitate final approval well in advance of the beginning of the academic year. Our hiring policies contain an explicit consultation process with the relevant dean and academic unit to address any questions that arise at the campus or BOT level. The off-cycle tenure review process itself has been revised and strengthened to be more faculty driven. Additionally, in a collaborative effort with the Academic Senate, the Provost’s Office memorialized the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign’s long-held dedication to shared governance by issuing Provost’s Communication No. 27, Shared Governance for Academic Units.
We appreciate President Killeen’s support over the past year as we have jointly acted to ensure protection of our university-wide commitment to academic freedom.

We’re just days away from our 145th Commencement. Work is already underway to prepare Memorial Stadium for the celebration and Alma’s cap and gown are being steamed and pressed. That means the end of another year at Illinois is coming up fast.
Congratulations to all of you who will earn an Illinois degree next week. You’ve worked hard for this recognition and wherever your path leads you, I hope you will always consider this place “home.”
To our students who aren’t as far along in your academic journeys – I want to wish you good luck with your final exams and projects. I know this can be a stressful and hectic couple of days. I encourage you to step back and take a deep breath when you can and to remember that the summer break is just around the corner.
If you are feeling overwhelmed, please reach out to one of the many campus resources available to help. The Counseling Center (333-3704), the Student Assistance Center (333-0050) and the Emergency Dean (24 hours a day, 333-0050) are great places to start. We want you to be successful. But most of all, we want you to be safe and we want to see you back here and reenergized in the fall.

In a year of unexpected leadership transitions and unprecedented financial challenges, you have remained unwaveringly committed to delivering the comprehensive excellence in the teaching, research and engagement that the world has come to expect from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
The day after I took this position last August I sent a note to the entire campus community. In it, I asked all of you to help ensure that this was a year of momentum and forward progress for Illinois. Despite all the challenges along the way where we could have chosen paths that would divide us – we’ve come through it together. I hope you agree that we have made progress!

They and their committee have led a thorough and thoughtful process that identifies the benefits and challenges of moving forward with this effort. They reached out to the various stakeholder groups, listened carefully to all perspectives and now recommend we move forward with this initiative. The Student Senate voted to support the final report of the ad-hoc committee by a vote of 28-2-1. The report is available at http://iss.illinois.edu/.
The students recommend an open, educational and transparent process to identify a first-ever mascot that includes not only students and the campus community, but also alumni and the local community.
I have accepted their report and its recommendations, and I intend to appoint a steering committee of 10-12 people – with representatives from various stakeholder groups. We will begin preliminary work shortly after Commencement and will create a timeline going forward.
I want to thank committee chairs, Mark Schaer and Alex Villanueva, and every member of the ad-hoc committee for their commitment and dedication to this effort.

We are pleased to announce that negotiators for the university and the Non-Tenure Faculty Coalition have reached a tentative agreement on a five-year contract. The NTFC has scheduled a meeting for today to vote on whether to end its five-day work stoppage and will schedule a vote in the near future for its membership to review and vote on this tentative agreement.
Students in courses taught by specialized faculty should expect to hear from their instructors this evening on whether those classes will be held tomorrow.
With this milestone agreement, the university and the Non-Tenure Faculty Coalition look forward to building a productive, long-term relationship for the future. 
We would not achieve our mission as a leading public research university without the excellent work and dedication of our specialized faculty. We are a stronger institution when they are integral partners in governance, when their teaching is protected by academic freedom and when they have appropriate predictability and stability in their appointments.
This tentative agreement addresses those priorities without supplanting the roles of the departments and colleges as important stewards of hiring and promotion for our academic programs. It also preserves the flexibility of units to offer multiyear contracts according to their own needs and financial capacity.
We greatly value the contributions of our specialized faculty, and we appreciate that negotiators for the union remained at the bargaining table with us to find common ground that achieves our shared goals.

Yesterday, Building Services staff found swastikas drawn in Lincoln Hall and the Armory, and another one was later found in Greg Hall. This follows a recent incident where a now-former employee left a noose on a table in a work area.
Facilities and Services staff working with the police removed the swastikas within an hour of discovery. Police think this vandalism happened between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. in Lincoln Hall, between 8:00 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. in the Armory and between 7:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. in Greg Hall. Investigators are reviewing security camera footage, and they ask that anyone with information contact them at 333-1216.
The probationary employee responsible for the noose incident was dismissed from the university shortly after admitting to making it.
This academic year we’ve seen threatening anonymous Facebook posts directed at our African American students and demeaning chalkings targeting Latinas and Latinos. We condemn acts like these that are intended to intimidate particular groups and do not advance legitimate discourse and debate.
When we encounter situations of intolerance, threats or violence, we are committed to responding quickly and decisively, which in some cases may include disciplinary actions or criminal prosecution.
Let’s conclude this year with a steadfast commitment to being welcoming and supportive of each other, and to demonstrating – with our words and acts – what it means to be a member of the Illinois family.

For students, please be advised that in some cases the department may provide a substitute instructor for those days; in other cases it might combine course sections or cancel the class. A few classes may be moved to classrooms in a different building. If you have any questions about a specific class, please contact your instructor or the department head of the unit offering the course for more information.
We worked with the union bargaining team through the federal mediator for more than 10 hours today, with the provost present and involved throughout, except for two short periods when he had to attend other meetings. We made progress on several issues, ending with the delivery to the NTFC of a comprehensive proposal that was revised substantially from our initial proposals presented at the start of the day. We also agreed to hold mediation sessions on Friday morning and all day Tuesday to ensure continued progress. We appreciated the active work by the NTFC bargaining team throughout the day.

Dear colleagues:
Today, the legislature approved a bipartisan measure that will provide stop-gap funding for the University of Illinois and the state’s other public universities, and the governor has expressed his support for the bill.
While we are grateful that partial funding will be restored, we see the agreement as only a beginning, not the end. We will continue to advocate strongly for adequate funding to support our students and our campuses, and I have outlined our goals and concerns in the statement below, which has been shared with legislators and with the media.
I will continue to update you as our efforts unfold, and my thanks to all of you for your dedicated service to this great university.
Sincerely,Tim
Killeen statement on stop-gap funding agreementThe University of Illinois system appreciates the bipartisan effort in Springfield to provide partial, stop-gap funding for the state’s public universities, who have been forced to manage through the first 10 months of fiscal 2016 with no state appropriation.
The action Friday recognizes the importance of public higher education in Illinois and the critical role that universities throughout the state play in the well-being and prosperity of our citizens.
It is imperative that the public universities in Illinois receive responsible, sustainable levels of financial support from the state. The legislation avoided a catastrophe of no state funding for higher education for fiscal 2016 and it will help public universities continue to operate through the end of the fiscal year on June 30.
However, the measure is insufficient as a total funding commitment for fiscal 2016, providing only $180 million for the U of I – compared with $647 million for fiscal year 2015. The U of I may be forced to make additional drastic reductions in faculty, staff, academic offerings, student programs, economic development initiatives and public service if it does not receive more than the 27.8 percent of last year’s appropriation that is provided in the stop-gap bill.
The stop-gap appropriation also includes greatly reduced funding for the University of Illinois Hospital – about $11 million, or a quarter of fiscal year 2015 levels– which will put medical care at risk for thousands of patients – many from underserved communities.
Funding for Monetary Assistance Program (MAP) grants is also partially restored, but would provide only about $170 million statewide – about 45 percent of the fiscal year 2015 appropriation and short of the needs to serve deserving students across the state.
The U of I is the state’s largest educator, with a statewide presence and 80,000 students, and state funding for our operations accounts for 54 percent of the state’s appropriation for public universities. Ninety-five percent of the appropriation is dedicated to personnel costs. Our fiscal year 2015 appropriation covered the salaries of roughly 6,000 employees and funding at the levels proposed in the stop-gap measure would cover only 2,000.
We strongly urge the governor, legislative leaders and rank-and-file lawmakers of both parties to continue to work on a comprehensive budget for fiscal 2016 that includes levels for higher education closer to the level seen in fiscal 2015, along with adequate funding for fiscal year 2017."
2016-04-21T17:28:00Z,2016-04-21,17:28,4430,Position Elimination Period - Information for Civil Service...,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/27766.html,"Dear Civil Service Employees:
On Monday, April 18, a memo went to all unit executive officers outlining a process and timeline they must follow if they are considering the elimination of any Civil Service positions as they plan for next year. Ordinarily, it is not necessary to coordinate layoffs when units eliminate positions. Because of the current budget uncertainty, however, a larger number of units are engaging in restructuring than normally occurs at one time. These efforts to reduce costs and become more efficient always affect multiple types of employees (administrators, other academic professionals and Civil Service staff). When multiple units are restructuring in ways that include Civil Service employees, it can be challenging to manage the impact on our employees because of bumping rights that Civil Service employees hold. By coordinating any layoffs, it is our hope that we can minimize the total number of Civil Service employees affected across the campus.
Monday’s email and the plan it announced is not a campus directive to eliminate positions and is not any kind of layoff notice. The goal of this preliminary planning process is to limit the impact on our employees by preserving as many positions as possible and ensuring that every employee can exercise his or her full employment rights.
The memo to unit executive officers outlined a position elimination period that mandates:
a single date (May 16) by which units must submit any proposed position eliminations to Staff Human Resources (SHR);
a date range (now-June 27) during which SHR will review each layoff request, the employment rights of the affected individual, and the cascading effects associated with seniority bumping rights;
a date range (May 17-June 27) to work with units to develop best plans to address their specific needs and to work with affected employees to discuss their rights and options;
a single final date (July 25) for all units to inform employees who will be laid off;
and the effective date of any final layoffs will be August 27.
Additionally, Staff Human Resources has taken several immediate actions designed to limit the impact on our staff both in terms of layoff and bumping. These include a temporary suspension of any new Civil Service hiring and the limiting of Civil Service testing.
Yesterday’s memo did not discuss other employee groups because Civil Service employees are the only employees who have bumping rights. It is the case, however, that campus units are looking at all aspects of their budgets and making tough decisions about staffing levels across all employment groups. As I’ve said in my recent budget presentations, the vast majority of our state budget allocation is spent on our people. And the reductions we anticipate require us to be proactive in our human resource planning for the future.
The memo to unit executive officers was intended to help them plan in ways that would be least disruptive and alarming to our campus community. We believe that this planning and coordination process gives us an opportunity to keep the number of laid off employees at an absolute minimum. We will be more direct in our communication about these efforts going forward.
We understand uncertainty can be frustrating and I encourage you to speak with Employment Services (333-2137) with any questions you have about this process.
Regards,
Edward FeserInterim Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"
2016-04-19T12:38:00Z,2016-04-19,12:38,62296,Update on Negotiations with NTFC,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/27763.html,"Dear Members of the Campus Community:
The Non-Tenure Faculty Coalition (NTFC) has organized a strike that began this morning. The picketing is localized to the English Building and we are told the strike will continue through tomorrow. Although we continue to believe a strike is not in the best interests of our specialized faculty members, our students, or the campus, we respect the right of each specialized faculty member to decide whether or not to participate. Our goal has always been, and continues to be, to work with the NTFC to reach a fair and equitable contract.
In light of these developments, we want to make sure that the campus community has information regarding the current status of our negotiations for our first collective bargaining agreement with the NTFC. Through the extensive efforts of the university and the NTFC, we have reached 14 tentative agreements, including on several key items. We believe the best way to reach a contract is through continued and open negotiation and communication through the federal mediation process that the NTFC requested. It is important to note that the NTFC has chosen to strike after just one introductory meeting and one work session with that mediator.
The union cites three major areas as the key reasons for striking: mandatory multi-year contracts for members, contractually mandated shared governance and a contractual guarantee of academic freedom.
As a campus, we support multi-year contracts, as demonstrated by the authorization and encouragement to units in Provost’s Communications No. 17 and 25 to issue such contracts. Individual academic units are best-positioned to award multi-year contracts, as they best know their unique curricular needs and financial capacity. Multi-year contracts should be awarded based on performance, evaluation and merit, not centrally mandated and automatically granted based on the amount of time someone has worked here.
We strongly endorse academic freedom protections and a role in governance for specialized faculty members. We have consistently offered contract language that recognizes specialized faculty members are entitled to the academic freedom protections afforded by our University Statutes, and the Office of the Provost is working with academic units across the campus to clarify matters of voice and vote for specialized faculty. Where we differ with the NTFC is in our belief that robust shared governance – something we greatly wish to protect – is not served by bypassing our governance processes and legislating it through a labor contract. Labor contracts are intended to address wages, hours and terms and conditions of employment.
The NTFC has noted that despite the new provost policies, comparatively few specialized faculty members currently have multi-year contracts. They say colleges, schools and departments have not fully addressed the governance, evaluation and promotion matters and processes that are required to implement multi-year contracts. That is true, but not due to bad faith or a lack of commitment by the campus. Rather, the complexity of addressing these matters and the democratic processes that are at the core of our governance system means that moving from the status quo takes time.
The campus and NTFC have important and principled differences that deserve discussion, which is why we stand ready to continue the negotiations as planned. Future sessions are scheduled for April 27, May 11, May 26 and June 26.
One area where we are in complete and total agreement is the value to the university in the teaching and scholarship of our specialized faculty colleagues. This two-day strike seeks to demonstrate what we already know and believe. But it does not help us make progress together.
We strongly believe that working together with the federal mediator is the most productive way to resolve our issues as quickly and fairly as possible.
Sincerely,

You’ve probably heard that some of your teachers are planning to strike this week. Many of you are asking what that means for your classes, your grades and – for those who are expecting to graduate this spring – the completion of your degrees.
Our priority is always protecting your educational interests to the best of our ability. We expect that most classes will be held during this strike. However, some of your teachers are represented by the Non-Tenure Faculty Coalition and they could choose not to teach their classes during a strike. In some cases the department might provide a substitute instructor for those days; in other cases the department might combine course sections or cancel the class. A few classes may be moved to classrooms in a different building.  If you get to a class and your instructor does not arrive, please check with the office of the department offering the class.
If you have any questions about a specific class, please contact your instructor or the department head for more information.
We will work hard to minimize the disruption of instruction. Please know we are committed to ensuring that you can make timely progress toward your degrees, meet your course objectives and receive your grades in a timely fashion.
Thank you for your patience as we continue to work with the union negotiators to reach an agreement.

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes.
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes. We are not including certain details in this alert so as to avoid releasing identifying information about the victim.
The University of Illinois Police Department has received a report from a student that she was sexually abused at approximately 3:00 a.m. on Sunday, April 17, near Burrill Hall, 407 S. Goodwin Avenue, Urbana (map).  The victim reported that 3 or 4 unknown college age males approached her, picked her up and groped her.  No additional suspect information was provided.
The University of Illinois Police Department has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area, and we are fortunate to have our force supplemented by the Urbana and Champaign police departments. Between these agencies, the Urbana campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 1,000 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS) or by visiting www.373tips.com. Anonymous tips may also be sent via text message by texting keyword ""CCTIP"" plus the information to 274637 (CRIMES).
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit WeCare.illinois.edu.
If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another person, intervene if it’s safe to do so or call for assistance.
While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. For more information about reporting rape, please visit illinois.edu.
Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.
It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves.

Dear Students,
Hope you’re enjoying spring!
I'm writing to tell you about the next stage in Grand Challenge Learning, the campus’s new approach to General Education. In Fall 2016, the campus is introducing our new 200-level Critical Frameworks courses, each of which meets at least two Gen Ed requirements. These courses are open to all undergraduates and have no prerequisites.
Have you ever wondered what it would be like to work with several professors from all over campus who care passionately about topics like Health, Inequality, or Sustainability? Students like you told us about these interests. We’ve reached out to some of the most talented teachers on campus to create three unique Critical Frameworks courses—each of which takes you a step closer to completing a Grand Challenge pathway while earning General Education credit. 
The Frameworks courses will put you in conversation with award-winning faculty in the arts, sciences, social sciences, humanities, business, and engineering. 
Each Frameworks course meets twice per week: first for a lecture that gathers all students and faculty, and next in small seminars. Through this innovative structure, you’ll benefit from the expertise of several faculty while working closely with your professor and a network of peers. You’ll meet interesting students, hear great lectures, and participate in group projects that you can publish on your own electronic portfolio. 
Click on the below links to Course Explorer and see which Frameworks course fits your interests and schedule! You can also watch our short video, visit our webpage, talk to your advisor, or email lgoodad@illinois.edu.
GCL 200/201*: Frameworks for Inequality & Cultural Understanding2 Gen Eds: Humanities & the Arts/US Minority Cultures(*GCL 201 also meets Advanced Composition)

Universities like ours are places where controversial and sometimes divisive issues are considered and debated. It is the role of higher education to address challenging topics, and it is often at the uncomfortable edges of challenging conversations where we make our greatest advances.
We value respectful discourse while also recognizing that offensive speech is protected by the First Amendment.
The best recourse to speech with which we disagree is more speech:
Speech that clearly articulates a stronger and better argued point of view.
Speech that represents the values we hold most dear.
Speech that builds connections and shared understanding.
Throughout the academic year, we will see and hear perspectives that anger and even frighten us. Last semester, we saw incidents in social media. This week, it was chalking on the Quad. We don’t know what the next issue will be, but we know there will be one. These are often painful moments for our students, faculty and staff and we need to support one another as we strive to address divisive issues in society. 
There are campus policies in place to ensure the physical safety of everyone in the community. We work with campus and local public safety officials to ensure people may gather safely and express concerns or opinions. There are many resources on campus to ensure safety and to address incidences of bias and discrimination. Acts of intolerance should be reported to the Office of the Dean of Students at 217-333-0050, tolerance@illinois.edu or http://go.illinois.edu/intolerance (for anonymous reporting) or contact the Office of Diversity, Equity and Access at 217-333-0885 (http://diversity.illinois.edu). When we learn of acts of intolerance, we convene our Bias Incident Investigation and Response Team within 48 hours to determine appropriate course of action.
We encourage every member of the campus community to exercise her/his own right to free speech and free expression. We are at our best when we engage in constructive dialogue that encompasses the widest range of views and voices.

Barbara Wilson Interim Chancellor

My name is Kaylee Barron and I am a master's student in the College of Education. I am also representing graduate students on the chancellor's search committee because, as you know, we have initiated a search for the chancellor of the Urbana campus and vice president of the University of Illinois system. During this process we are assisted by the search firm, Greenwood/Asher & Associates (G/A). In order to help us to identify the most suitable potential candidates, the search committee would like to offer all graduate students the opportunity to meet with members of the search committee to discuss the important challenges facing the new chancellor over the next few weeks. This is a key part of the search process and we hope you will be able to participate.
There are two Open Forum Days where faculty, staff, and students from across campus can come by room 407 in the Union and meet with members of the search committee. We have reserved a session from 2:15 - 2:45 p.m. on Thursday March 17 for graduate students, though you can attend any of the open sessions as well (see the schedule). I ask not only that you attend, but that you please share this message with other campus constituents so they can also attend their respective meeting.
The committee would like you to be thoughtful about the future of the Urbana campus and the ways in which we can measure the outcomes and successes of the person in this position. The categories of topics we are interested in are:
1) Objectives for the new chancellor. What do you want the new chancellor to accomplish? What are the desired outcomes for the role and for the University? How will you know in three to five years that the right person was hired? What will have happened?
2) Qualifications and Experience. Based on the objectives identified, what do you think are the qualifications and experience of an ideal candidate? What is essential and what might be helpful? What as graduate students do we wish to see the next Chancellor bring to the University?
3) Personal Qualities. What are the personal attributes most important for this role?
4) Source and candidate recommendations. Finally, who should the search firm contact in the outreach to identify candidates? Obviously, one of the main jobs of the search committee will be to provide candidate names to the search firm (all initial contacts with candidates will be handled by G/A). G/A will also draw on their own networks, but, in addition, they want to tap into those of the campus as a whole. This certainly means suggestions of possible candidates, but just as important, suggestions of good sources who might lead to strong candidates.
Your input will set the stage for G/A to have solid discussions with potential candidates, with the goal of providing the best possible background material to the Committee as it decides which potential candidates to pursue further. Later in the process, when the Committee interviews candidates, the input from these meetings will help us evaluate their skills and experience.
For more details on the search see http://go.illinois.edu/chancellorsearch.
Thank you for your participation in this important effort. Your input and perspective are invaluable resources as we conduct this mission critical search for the Urbana-Champaign campus.
I look forward your insight and assistance as we look to bring the most talented chancellor to the Urbana-Champaign campus.

Kaylee Barron

With spring break and other travel plans just around the corner, the campus is receiving questions about the Zika virus.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a travel alert to highlight countries where the Zika virus is prevalent. We’re not advising individuals to cancel travel plans to those areas, but there are a number of steps travelers can take to minimize their risks.
Travelers can limit their exposure to Zika (and other mosquito-borne illnesses) by taking precautions to prevent mosquito bites.
As discussed extensively in news and social media, Zika has been linked to birth defects. The CDC advises pregnant women to avoid travel to those regions, and also has issued guidance for male travelers who are concerned about potential exposure of Zika to female partners who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.
More information is available from the CDC’s Zika virus resource site.
University of Illinois students concerned about a risk of exposure to Zika related to upcoming travel may contact their personal physician or McKinley Health Center for more information. Pregnant women, or women planning to become pregnant, should consult with their OB-GYN.

We have begun an 18-month process to update the master plan for our campus. We use the master plan to guide our development, renovation and repurposing of facilities and spaces on campus.
The planning process will involve leadership and input from across the campus to help align the ongoing development of physical campus spaces with academic plans and programs. Our goal is to create a plan that provides a campus environment that supports our learning, discovery and outreach missions while serving as an example of sustainability and enriching our diverse communities and neighborhoods.
The plan will be stronger and better if everyone shares ideas and feedback, so the committee will launch an interactive website soon and will host several Town Hall meetings to gather input from campus and community members. Information about the current master plan is available at https://www.uocpres.uillinois.edu/resources/planning. The first Town Hall will be Apr. 12 from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. in the Activities and Recreation Center (ARC), room MP6. We hope you can attend.

As you know, we have initiated a search for the next permanent Chancellor/Vice President of the Urbana-Champaign campus. On behalf of the Advisory Committee, I invite you to participate in a campus-wide forum about the search:
Public Forum on the Search for a Chancellor/Vice PresidentUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignIllini Union BallroomFriday March 11, 12pm-1:30pm
We are conducting a national search for the very best candidates: people with outstanding records of scholarly achievement and academic leadership experience who have a keen sense of the dynamic environment in which public higher education operates now. This Chancellor will be taking office on the eve of the 150th anniversary of our establishment as a land-grant institution. The challenge will be to lead the campus into a vibrant future that draws on its core values – academic excellence, award-winning teaching, inclusion and diversity, and innovation.
During the Public Forum, the committee will outline the responsibilities of the Chancellor/VP position and the search process. We will then open the floor for discussion. We are eager to hear your views on the following:
The qualifications and expertise you believe we should be looking for;
Your short and long-term expectations of the Chancellor’s role at Urbana;
The challenges and opportunities you think the candidates will need to address.
A link to the livestream will be posted on http://illinois.edu on Mar. 11.
To assist in the search process, the University has engaged the executive search firm Greenwood/Asher & Associates: http://www.greenwoodsearch.com. Jan Greenwood and Julie Holley from G/A will be available for questions at the Forum, as will President Killeen.
We plan to have a search website, with the position description, a nomination portal and a timeline available before spring break.
Thank you in advance for assisting us in this important work. We look forward to seeing you on March 11.

At Illinois, we expect our students to take responsibility for their behavior and its impact on others. Unfortunately, in past years, the event has led to serious injuries and at least two deaths. We want to make it clear that the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign does not sponsor or sanction Unofficial St. Patrick's Day nor any events or merchandise associated with it. On that day, as on other days, the University responds to all violations of the Student Code, regardless of where the behavior occurs. Such violations include consuming alcohol as a minor, providing alcohol to minors, damage and destruction of property, dangerous activities such as throwing items from balconies, and acts of physical violence and sexual aggression. The consequences for such violations will be assigned commensurate with the seriousness of the behavior which may include dismissal. As a reminder, disciplinary records are subject to review in background checks by graduate schools and future employers.         At Illinois, students who host guests may be held accountable for negative consequences incurred by those guests, including property damage or threats to others' safety. If a guest or visitor is cited or arrested for illegal activity, we will forward this information for disciplinary action to any college or university where that guest may be enrolled. The State of Illinois recently enacted a law which holds individuals (social hosts) criminally responsible for hosting an event or social gathering (party) where he or she knowingly authorizes or permits a residence which he or she occupies to be used for underage possession or consumption of alcohol. Violation of the law can lead to being charged with a Class A misdemeanor (which carries up to 364 days in jail and a $2,500 fine) or a Class 4 Felony (which carries up to 3 years in jail and a $25,000 fine). Hosts found serving or allowing minors to possess alcohol or charging admission will be arrested on state charges and transported to the Champaign County Jail.  
Please remember that your behavior during this event will reflect on you and on your university for years to come. For example, is a social media posting of you wearing an offensive shirt drinking alcohol the image you want to project to future employers, to your family or to the world?
Given the serious consequences that could occur, we strongly urge you to choose responsible behavior and ask that you look out for the safety of yourselves and others. Remember that the University has a medical amnesty policy which means that if you call 911 to get help for someone, you cannot get in trouble for your own level of intoxication, even if you are underage. See more about medical amnesty and the University judicial system at www.conflictresolution.illinois.edu.
Please be careful. Please be safe.  Sincerely,
C. Renée Romano         Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs

I hope you are having a strong start to your spring semester. I wanted to make you aware of a few opportunities quickly approaching.
1) The University of Illinois Alumni Association and the Illinois Student Senate have teamed up to send students down to Springfield on March 2nd for a day of lobbying. As you may know, we are approaching the 9th month without state funding to the University of Illinois and the Monetary Awards Program (MAP). You can sign up to attend here. Free lunch and transportation will be provided.
2) Every year the Illinois Student Senate opens nominations for over 40 campus committees and boards that advise various entities of the University. Examples of committees include working with student fees, campus safety, sustainability, cultural centers, and the Krannert Center. If you are interested in applying and providing input to a campus unit, you can find the application here.
3) Nominations are now open for the Illinois Student Senate’s annual Teaching Excellence Awards. This student-run initiative recognizes and thanks excellent instructors. Please consider nominating a professor or TA who has made an impact on your time here at the University of Illinois. The nomination form can be found here. Nominations are due by March 12th.
All the best to you as you study for midterms and enjoy the spring semester.

On Friday, March 4, 2016, many students and visitors will participate in an event known as Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. While the University does not support or condone this event, steps are being taken to ensure safety and to minimize disruption to classes and campus operations.
The Champaign, Urbana, and University of Illinois police departments, assisted by other local and state agencies, will patrol the campus district on March 4. They will enforce all applicable ordinances in commercial and residential areas and have authority to intervene if private parties threaten to disturb the peace. In addition, Champaign and Urbana officials will enact restrictions on liquor sales intended to curb overconsumption. Emergency medical personnel will be available to provide care.
University police will continue to focus on protecting students, staff, faculty, and University property. Should you need to report an incident, call METCAD at 911 for emergencies, 333-8911 for non-emergencies.
As in years past, we have made clear to students that academic business will continue as usual on Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. That has helped to minimize disruptions. Instructors are encouraged not to cancel classes.
The Student Code http://studentcode.illinois.edu/ addresses student responsibilities on campus. Sections 1-102(d) and 1-302(f) concern classroom conduct expectations, and section 1-307 focuses on alcohol consumption. The Code empowers instructors to ask disruptive students to leave class; after class, names of disruptive students should be reported to the Office of Student Conflict Resolution at 333-3680.
If asking a disruptive student to leave class could escalate into a confrontation, you may seek assistance. From 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on March 4, teams of Student Affairs and Academic Affairs professionals will walk through and around buildings with classrooms and lecture halls where disruptions were experienced in the past. Team members, who will be wearing nametags to identify them as volunteers, may be summoned to help. Teams will be prepared to document apparent Code violations and to call University police, if necessary.
Students will be asked not to bring any liquids into Foellinger Auditorium and Lincoln Hall Theatre. Longstanding policy prohibits liquids and food in these spaces.
Students who interfere with the academic mission of the University will face serious consequences. Thank you for reinforcing this message before and on March 4.

I want to let you know that I have selected Illinois alumnus Josh Whitman as the new Director of Athletics. Josh is a two-time Illinois alumnus, graduating with Bronze Tablet honors in 2001 while earning a bachelor’s degree in finance, and graduating from law school summa cum laude in 2008.
His work ethic, his passion, his concern for the welfare of student-athletes and his commitment to diversity, as well as his record of leaving programs under his leadership better and stronger than when he arrived were the main factors in my decision. He understands the complexities of modern college athletics, but he hasn’t lost any of the sense of fun and joy that should be part of amateur sports.
At Illinois we want to compete hard, act with integrity and give our student-athletes the kind of positive experiences that stay with them throughout their lives and careers. I am confident that Josh has the background, knowledge and drive to ensure that our athletics program is a source of pride for each of us.
Josh will be introduced to campus tomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m. The news conference will be broadcast live at www.FightingIllini.com.

Sexual violence and misconduct is an issue on campuses across the country, and ours is no exception. It is important that we take an active role in preventing, reporting and responding to sexual misconduct when we encounter it and remain committed to providing a safe environment where we all can live, learn and work.
On February 15th, you received an email from the University Ethics Officer directing you to complete an online sexual misconduct training course which provides users with an understanding of what kind of conduct constitutes a violation of law or university policy. It covers reporting options and discusses opportunities and methods to intervene if a faculty, staff or student is a witness to instances of sexual misconduct.
Finally, it helps University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign employees – including graduate student employees and professional students – understand their response and reporting obligations if a student, faculty or staff member reports an incident of sexual misconduct, as well as the resources available to address sexual violence. With very few exceptions, many of us are “responsible employees,” meaning we must report instances of sexual misconduct when they come to our attention.
Graduate students who complete the training this week will be entered into a drawing for a $75 gift card. Those who complete the course between February 22 and March 6 will be eligible to win a $50 gift card, and anyone who completes the training after those dates will qualify to win a $25 gift card. More information about the training is available at http://wecare.illinois.edu/faq/training/.
Join me in completing this training so we can continue to encourage a safe and secure environment which fosters the academic and professional success of our students, faculty and staff.

Dear friends and colleagues:
I am pleased to announce the appointment of Lindsay Anderson, an Urbana-Champaign graduate and former high-ranking legislative advisor in the state capital, as executive director for governmental relations for the University of Illinois, pending approval by the Board of Trustees.
She will bring more than a decade of public policy experience when she assumes her new role March 1, leading efforts to advocate for the University’s interests with federal, state and local officials and key higher education associations.
Lindsay is currently an attorney with Chicago-based McGuire Woods, where she advises clients on working with government. She rejoined the law firm in 2013, after four years as legislative director and later senior advisor in the administration of former Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn. In those roles, she advised the governor and state agencies on legislation, working closely with legislators on both sides of the aisle, and also oversaw the governor’s Office of Federal Relations. Earlier, she served as assistant counsel in the office of House Speaker Michael Madigan and as a mayoral fellow in the office of former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley.
Since 2013, she also has chaired two important statewide boards that serve the University and its employees – the Illinois Board of Higher Education and the State Universities Retirement System. She was appointed to the boards by Quinn, and has continued to serve on both under Gov. Bruce Rauner; she will resign from both positions before joining the University.
Lindsay earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology from the Urbana-Champaign campus in 2001, and a law degree from the Chicago-Kent College of Law in 2005. In 2015, she was an Edgar Fellow, an executive leadership training program developed by former Gov. Jim Edgar and the U of I Institute of Government and Public Affairs (IGPA).
Her knowledge of the University and years of legislative experience will serve us well as we continue to ramp up advocacy efforts to support our students, our world-class academic and research programs, and our crucial role in driving progress and economic growth.
I am grateful to the committee that assisted in the search, headed by IGPA Director Christopher Mooney, and to interim Director of State Relations Jennifer Creasey and interim Director of Federal Relations Melissa Haas for their talents in helping to guide our legislative advocacy efforts in the interim.
Please join me in congratulating Lindsay, and welcoming her to the University of Illinois.
Sincerely,Tim"

As we begin a new semester, I want to make sure that you are aware of the resources available to help educate about, prevent, support those impacted by, and respond to sexual misconduct. Last week, President Killeen sent a message regarding an upcoming online training program, which is mandatory for non-student employees, regarding discrimination and sexual violence. 
In advance of that training, I hope you will take a few minutes to visit the We Care website at http://www.wecare.illinois.edu/.  We created this website to provide a one-stop resource for students, faculty, staff, parents and community members, with information about confidential and non-confidential resources, reporting options, university policies, and disciplinary procedures.
I’m also writing to inform you that we have named Assistant Dean Amy Thomson to serve as our Title IX Coordinator on an interim basis. Ms. Thomson has a great deal of expertise in this area. She has been integrally involved in our campus' ongoing efforts to further develop and clarify Title IX processes and procedures, including leading the work group that created the We Care website, and has worked supporting students through the Student Assistance Center.  For more information about the Title IX Coordinator’s role and her contact information, please see http://wecare.illinois.edu/titleix/.
I am confident in the resources, policies, and procedures we have established to address sexual misconduct on our campus.
I will let you know when a permanent Title IX Coordinator has been appointed following a nationwide search. I appreciate your help as we all work together on this very important issue.

2016-02-08T15:04:00Z,2016-02-08,15:4,62641,Campus Safety Notice,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/27700.html,"Dear campus community member:
We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes.
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes. We are not including certain details in this alert so as to avoid releasing identifying information about the victim.
The University of Illinois Police Department on Monday received a report that a student was sexually assaulted early Sunday morning, Feb. 7, at a fraternity house by a person known to the victim.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to assist those involved in this incident and will continue to take actions to maintain the safety and security of the campus community.
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit WeCare.illinois.edu.
If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another person, intervene if it’s safe to do so or call for assistance.
While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. For more information about reporting rape, please visit WeCare.illinois.edu.
Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.
It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.

The University of Illinois places a high priority on providing our students, faculty, staff, and visitors with a safe, secure environment in which to live, learn, work, and be respected. We demonstrate our commitment to safety and security through strong education and prevention programs to prevent and respond to crimes and other threats to our collective safety and security.  
Our most effective safety measures involve you – our students, faculty, and staff – in partnership with campus police and student and faculty services.  
To help ensure compliance with new state and federal laws, students, faculty, and staff are expected to participate in a new online training program (mandatory for non-student employees) focusing on preventing discrimination and sexual violence. Please watch for more information from your campus and for training instructions from the University Ethics Officer (ethicsofficer@uillinois.edu).
The new comprehensive program will prepare you to play a significant role in our efforts to maintain and enhance our campuses by taking appropriate precautions, alerting authorities of danger or suspicious behaviors, and by assisting victims in obtaining needed support.  
I am making this training a priority on my schedule and request each of you do the same. Thank you for your commitment to the University and to our community.
Sincerely,
Tim KilleenPresident"

We would like to inform you of crimes which have recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, please visit CrimeReports.com.
The Champaign Police Department requested today that we notify you of four recent incidents, all of which occurred in similar areas just off-campus:
At 11:44 p.m. Jan. 31 in the 300 block of East Clark Street, a man was hit in the head from behind by an offender with a rock.
At 10:55 p.m. Jan. 27 in the 200 block of South Fourth Street, a woman was approached by two men, one of whom struck her in the face and took her belongings. No weapon was seen.
Around 8 p.m. Jan. 24 in the 200 block of East White Street, an offender put his arm around a man’s neck and demanded money. No weapon was seen.
At 10:49 p.m. Jan. 17 in the 300 block of East Springfield Avenue, a man grabbed a woman’s purse and fled. A second man knocked the woman to the ground from behind. No weapon was seen.
Anyone with information is encouraged to contact the Champaign Police Department at 217-351-4545. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS) or by visiting www.373tips.com. Anonymous tips may also be sent via text message by texting keyword ""CCTIP"" plus the information to 274637 (CRIMES). All calls to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of caller ID information and are answered by a third-party service, not the police.
The University of Illinois Police Department has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area, and we are fortunate to have our force supplemented by the Urbana and Champaign police departments. Between these agencies, the Urbana campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 1,000 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
This is our community. Let's stay together.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks escort if you need one, or download the app for iOS or Android.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.

As we begin a new semester, I want to make sure that you are aware of the resources available to help educate about, prevent, support those impacted by, and respond to sexual misconduct.
I hope you will take a few minutes to learn about these resources by visiting the We Care website at http://www.wecare.illinois.edu/.  We created this website to provide a one-stop resource for students, faculty, staff, parents and community members, with information about confidential and non-confidential resources, reporting options, university policies, and disciplinary procedures.
I’m also writing to inform you that we have named Assistant Dean Amy Thomson to serve as our Title IX Coordinator on an interim basis.  Ms. Thomson has a great deal of expertise in this area.  She has been integrally involved in our campus' ongoing efforts to further develop and clarify Title IX processes and procedures, including leading the work group that created the We Care website, and has worked supporting students through the Student Assistance Center.  For more information about the Title IX Coordinator’s role and her contact information, please see http://wecare.illinois.edu/titleix/.
I am confident in the resources, policies, and procedures we have established to address sexual misconduct on our campus.
I will let you know when a permanent Title IX Coordinator has been appointed following a nationwide search.  I appreciate your help as we all work together on this very important issue.

Dear friends and colleagues:
As a new semester begins, we hope there also will be a renewed focus on a state budget to restore funding for the University of Illinois and public higher education across our state.
The new year will bring legislators back to the Capitol and Gov. Bruce Rauner is preparing for his annual State of the State address later this month, more than seven months since a budget impasse shut off state funding support that is critical to our students, our academic programs and our day-to-day operations.
We continue to aggressively champion the University’s interests, and recently forged a new alliance that will bring business, labor and our sister universities together to speak as one on the importance of higher education to our state’s future.
At the same time, we also continue to look inwardly, examining our operations from top to bottom to ensure that our challenges don’t stand in the way of our land-grant mission to serve the needs of our students and our state.
I’m proud of everything we’ve accomplished – freezing in-state tuition for the second straight year, holding the line on mandatory student fees for the first time in memory, new initiatives in central administration that have achieved $40 million in annual recurring savings and redirected more than $8 million toward student programs and services, and new strategies by the campuses to weather potential reductions in state funding.
Those efforts to steward resources prudently and responsibly must continue even after a state budget is finalized. We will work with the state to build a sustainable financial model that ensures affordability and opportunity for students, preserves our excellence and expands our service to the people of Illinois and our nation.
The University of Illinois is world-class today and will be world-class tomorrow: more affordable, more nimble, more transparent, more efficient, more creative, more student-centered – with integrity manifest throughout – and even stronger in leading-edge research, scholarship and learning. Working together, we will build on our rich legacy of excellence and help lead progress for generations to come.
Thank you for your service and support, and I wish you a semester filled with joy and achievement.
Sincerely,Tim"

Urbana campus snow removal is a carefully coordinated effort involving more than 125 F&S employees in cooperation with other campus units, plus the cities of Champaign and Urbana. To learn more about F&S' commitment to this priority work, please watch a short video: http://go.illinois.edu/snowiceremoval.   
Additional information regarding priority parking lots and removal procedures are available on the F&S website: http://www.fs.illinois.edu/services/maintenance/snow-removal. If you have questions about snow removal or to report persistent areas of snow and ice, contact the F&S Service Office, 217-333-0340.
Parking:If assigned parking areas have yet to be plowed, please use designated priority lots (B4, E14, F27) and Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District (MTD) service. Please do not park in unplowed lots as it further complicates and delays snow removal efforts.
Sidewalks/Pathways:  Typically, an initial clearing pass is made of all 90 miles of campus sidewalk prior to the start of classes. Variable winter weather conditions can significantly impact locations across campus, forming persistent snow/ice in some areas and impeding the ability of the F&S Grounds department to maintain sidewalk and bicycle pathways cleared from edge-to-edge. University Housing and the Division of Intercollegiate Athletics perform some snow removal at campus residence halls and athletic facilities.
Pretreatment:Prior to winter weather events if conditions are favorable, F&S Grounds and Transportation crews will apply brine to streets, parking lots, and sidewalks to assist with melting snow and ice. This de-icing solution is an economical and effective way to pretreat large areas of campus without harming the landscape. Current university road-salt reserves are sufficient for a winter with typical snowfall and will allow for regular application.
Extreme Conditions:At any time, winter weather conditions may become so unusual or unexpected that F&S staff, in consultation with campus administration, may briefly order a departure from general snow removal procedures."

The Consumer Protection Safety Commission (CPSC) and the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) have issued alerts about the potential fire hazard so-called “hoverboards” can present, so the devices will not be allowed in any campus facilities beginning Jan. 18.
The campus policy prohibiting the use of inline skates, roller skates and skateboards in campus facilities is being updated to include a prohibition on self-balancing personal transportation devices, and we ask that you not to bring them to campus. If you already have one of the devices stored in a campus owned, leased, occupied or operated facility, you must remove it at the start of the semester.
The campuswide prohibition covers the use, carrying, charging, storage or other possession of the devices in classrooms, laboratories, meeting rooms and all other campus facilities. Those who violate the policy could face sanctions.
To view the complete policy regarding such devices, visit the CAM after Jan. 18 at http://cam.illinois.edu/. 
Thank you for complying with this new policy. Our number one priority is the safety of our campus community.

Dear colleagues:
I am pleased to announce the appointment of longtime University of Illinois administrator Dedra “DeeDee” Williams as secretary of the Board of Trustees and of the University, pending approval by the Board at its Jan. 21 meeting in Chicago.
She will assume her new role Jan. 16, providing a transition period where she will work alongside Susan Kies, who is retiring June 30 after nearly five years as secretary.
DeeDee brings a unique set of skills and experience to the job. She has been part of the University family since 1989, and served for nearly 23 years within various roles at the College of Medicine in Urbana-Champaign, culminating as associate dean of administration. In 2012, she was named assistant vice president for academic affairs, a position that has provided valuable insights on our academic priorities and given her an opportunity to work closely with our three distinctive campuses.
She also understands the needs of our students and alumni – a U of I graduate who earned her master’s degree in higher education administration from the Urbana-Champaign campus.
I am grateful to DeeDee for taking on this important new role and to the committee headed by Trustee Pat Fitzgerald that assisted in the search.
Please join me in congratulating DeeDee, and wishing Susan the best as she prepares to head into a much-deserved retirement after nearly 25 years of loyal and dedicated service to her alma mater.
Sincerely,
Tim"

On behalf of the search committee for the founding dean of the Carle Illinois College of Medicine, we are reaching out to provide you with an update and to seek your recommendations and input about potential candidates.
The leadership profile of the founding dean has been finalized and approved by the Urbana campus and Carle leadership. The leadership profile is a public document, and intended to reach hundreds of prospective candidates or nominators. The leadership profile and additional information pertinent to the dean’s search can be found on the web at http://medicine.illinois.edu/guiding-documents.html.
With the recruiting phase under way, the search committee will be working closely with our consultants at Witt/Kieffer to advertise the position in a broad range of relevant venues. However, the most productive source of high-potential candidates are the ones who are personally contacted or referred to Witt/Kieffer. While our consultants will be leveraging their vast network to identify and cultivate prospects, your proactive contribution to this important phase of the process is essential for developing the strongest pool of candidates.
With this in mind, we ask that you offer nominations from your professional and academic circles of people who would fit the profile we have developed. Please feel free to refer these to us or directly to Witt/Kieffer (CarleIllinoisDean@wittkieffer.com) for follow up.

2015-12-13T03:26:00Z,2015-12-13,3:26,64414,Campus Safety Notice,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/27661.html,"Dear campus community member:
We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This Campus Safety Notice is issued in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about crime to aid in the prevention of similar crimes and to assist in the identification of offenders.
This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, please visit CrimeReports.com.
The following Assault took place at 1:14 a.m. on Sunday, December 13, 2015, in the 700 block of South Sixth Street, (map) in Champaign:
The victim was walking northbound on the west sidewalk in the 700 Block of South Sixth Street, when an offender unknown to the victim ran up from behind and struck the victim in the back of the head causing the victim to fall to the ground and blackout. The victim was transported to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.
The offender was described as a male with an average build, approximately 6 feet tall wearing a gray sweatshirt and matching gray sweatpants. The offender was last seen running southbound from the scene.
Information about the race or ethnicity of alleged offenders is provided only to aid detailed descriptions that include physical stature, clothing or unusual characteristics. Racial descriptions do not, by themselves, offer a meaningful picture of an individual’s appearance.
The University of Illinois Police Department is actively investigating this incident.  The University of Illinois Police Department has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area, and we are fortunate to have our force supplemented by the Urbana and Champaign police departments. Between these agencies, the Urbana campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 1,000 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
A University of Illinois Police Department camera captured the incident, and that video is available by clicking on the following link:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIIuCAs9GcI
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS) or by visiting www.373tips.com. Anonymous tips may also be sent via text message by texting keyword ""CCTIP"" plus the information to 274637 (CRIMES).
This is our community. Let's stay together.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks escort if you need one, or download the app for iOS or Android.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.
If you choose to consume alcohol, please be responsible. Remember your ability to respond is diminished by overconsumption of alcohol.

2015-12-07T14:27:00Z,2015-12-07,14:27,64381,Looking to the New Year,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/27657.html,"Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,
These last few days of the semester are traditionally when I would be sharing a holiday greeting. With events of the past few weeks, however, I want to use this message for a different purpose. I would like to urge all of us to rededicate ourselves to ensuring our university lives up to its promise of being a welcoming and safe community.
My leadership team and I have been meeting regularly with student and faculty groups, and we have attended several recent rallies and vigils. These conversations and experiences have reinforced the difficult truth that for many on our campus, racism and discrimination are part of daily life. That is unacceptable.
With guidance from key committees and Associate Chancellor/Associate Provost for Diversity Menah Pratt-Clarke, some of our current efforts include:
We have put in place a mandatory diversity and inclusion online education module as part of University 101, and this spring all new students will take part in a peer-guided diversity workshop.
We now require diversity training for all employees who serve on search committees for new hires. More than 2,500 faculty and staff have completed this training so far.
We have increased undergraduate scholarship support -- an important contributor to our significant gains in the diversity of this year’s entering class.
We have committed $4.9 million to build and open a new facility for the Bruce D. Nesbitt African American Cultural Center in 2018.
In early January, we will launch a search for a new associate chancellor for diversity efforts and initiatives.
These are just a few examples of initiatives underway. You can read more here.
Yet there is more to be done. I am meeting with the student leaders of #BeingBlackAtIllinois and other groups after the semester break to identify additional actions we can take here at Illinois.
Universities like ours must be models of fair and non-discriminatory treatment as well as vigorous, respectful debate.
We are asking for your help. It will take a united effort from our faculty, staff and students to change culture, and it won’t happen overnight. It requires fresh ideas, institutional commitment, and honest evaluation and reflection from each one of us.
I hope the New Year brings us all back together with a renewed commitment to making Illinois a warm and welcoming campus for everyone.
Best Wishes,
Barb WilsonInterim Chancellor"

The AOD report represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment.  To ensure the success of this mission and to meet federal guidelines, this report is distributed annually to all Illinois students and employees.  Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources included within the report.

2015-12-07T10:21:00Z,2015-12-07,10:21,64379,Professor to advise on equity issues,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/27655.html,"Dear colleagues:
I am pleased to announce the appointment of Professor James D. Anderson as a new University of Illinois Presidential Fellow. In this role and during the next 12 months, he will work on a part-time basis with me and other campus and community members on important matters of inclusiveness and equity across our University system.
Professor Anderson is a highly distinguished and nationally renowned scholar whose research at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has focused on issues at the nexus of race and education in America. With this background, he will bring an enhanced level of faculty guidance and insight to the Office of the President to ensure that the U of I develops thoughtful, proactive strategies to address current and historical inequities, and to guard against others that may arise.
Each campus is currently working on existing and new initiatives aimed at eliminating racial inequity and discrimination. As a Presidential Fellow, Professor Anderson will act as a liaison from the Office of the President to those efforts, which range from student and employee affairs to campus safety and environment to the developing system-wide strategic plan. Also consulting with Professor Anderson will be Vice President for Academic Affairs Christophe Pierre. I am grateful for the support of the three campus chancellors in bringing Professor Anderson into this temporary position in the central administration.
Professor Anderson has held key leadership roles during his long tenure at UIUC. A member of the National Academy of Education, he is the Edward William and Jane Marr Gutsgell Professor of Education; Head of the Department of Education Policy, Organization and Leadership; Executive Associate Dean for the College of Education; and an affiliate Professor of History. He has provided expert testimony in numerous federal race-related legal cases, and has authored an award winning book and many publications on the subject.
The Presidential Fellows Program is new to the Office of the President. Modeled on other successful programs, it will tap into the deep talent pool of U of I faculty and provide an opportunity for individual faculty members to work part-time for one year on critical strategic initiatives and projects. It will provide me and other University leaders with faculty perspectives on a wide range of issues.
I look forward to the contribution Professor Anderson will make in helping the University of Illinois address a set of critical issues that affect and concern us all.
Sincerely,Tim"

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This Community Safety Notice is issued in cooperation with the Urbana Police Department to disclose information about crime to aid in the prevention of similar crimes and to assist in the identification of offenders.
This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, please visit CrimeReports.com.
The following armed robbery took place at 9 p.m. on Tuesday, November 24, at 1006 W. Stoughton Ave. (map) in Urbana:
The victim reported being in his parked vehicle when two offenders approached him and asked to use his cellphone. When he refused, one of the offenders displayed a small gun. The other offender demanded his money, wallet and phone. After the victim provided them with his money, the offenders pulled him from the car and an offender struck the victim in the head with the gun. They took his cellphone, watch and wallet. Both offenders fled northeast from the area. The victim was not seriously injured.
The first offender is described as a short male, wearing a black mask and jacket.  The second offender is described as a tall, skinny male wearing a red jacket and beanie. Both are described to be in their late teens to early twenties.
The Urbana and University Police Departments assisted the initial investigation. The Urbana Police Department continues to investigate. The University of Illinois Police Department has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area, and we are fortunate to have our force supplemented by the Urbana and Champaign police departments. Between these agencies, the Urbana campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 1,000 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS) or by visiting www.373tips.com. Anonymous tips may also be sent via text message by texting keyword ""CCTIP"" plus the information to 274637 (CRIMES).
This is our community. Let's stay together.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks escort if you need one, or download the app for iOS or Android.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.
If you choose to consume alcohol, please be responsible. Remember your ability to respond is diminished by overconsumption of alcohol.

Dear friends and colleagues:
Thanksgiving is a particularly special time – a time to gather with family and celebrate our blessings – and I sincerely hope that all of you have a wonderful holiday.
It is also an opportunity to look ahead and imagine a better tomorrow.
Recent events are reminders of the ongoing unrest in our world, from harm to innocents around the globe to growing concerns over discrimination in American society.
Working together, we at the University of Illinois can help lead the way to a future rooted in justice, social equality, mutual respect, understanding and inclusion. These bedrock values have helped guide this university since its founding – although we must admit to having fallen short at times. We must now strongly reaffirm our commitment and light a beacon to show the way toward that better tomorrow.
We will speak out firmly and clearly against expressions of hate or racial bias, and will react swiftly to acts of discrimination. We will champion a culture where all are treated equally, all are respected and all have the opportunity to live the lives of their dreams. We will exemplify open, inclusive and safe environments for all our students, faculty and staff, wherever they are and wherever they are from. We will expand our efforts university-wide in this regard and look forward to your thoughts and suggestions.
I wish you and yours the happiest of Thanksgivings, and thank you for your commitment to equality, to diversity and to this great university.
Sincerely,Tim"

Dear colleagues:
I am pleased to announce that Antoinette Burton has agreed to chair the 15-member committee that will advise me in our search for the next permanent chancellor and vice president of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Dr. Burton brings more than 15 years of experience as a teacher, researcher and administrator on the Urbana-Champaign campus. A University Scholar in 2001-2004 and John Simon Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship winner in 2010, she is a noted historian of 19th and 20th century Britain and its empire and former head of the Department of History. She also currently serves as interim director of the Illinois Program for Research in the Humanities, which promotes interdisciplinary study in the humanities, arts and social sciences.
I am grateful to her and other members for sharing their time and talents on the Committee to Advise the President on the Selection of a New Chancellor, who were announced earlier. I look forward to working with the advisory committee and having our next chancellor on board in time for the fall 2016 semester.
Further information about the search will be provided on a University of Illinois website that will be launched soon, and I will continue to update you on opportunities to provide input into the search process.    There is no question we will find an exceptional leader. This campus is truly one of the world’s best, with a nearly 150-year legacy of achievement and the potential to redefine higher education for the 21st century. I look forward to working with you as we add a new colleague who will help chart our future.Sincerely,Tim"

As campus leaders wrote earlier today, yesterday’s social media postings titled “Illini White Student Union” called for monitoring African American students who attended a rally on the Quad. As they said, these posts have been pulled from Facebook, but we know that incidents like this create a sense of fear and shake your confidence in the safety of our campus.
Please know there are many resources on campus to ensure your safety and to address incidences of bias and discrimination. Report acts of intolerance to the Office of the Dean of Students at 217-333-0050, tolerance@illinois.edu or go.illinois.edu/intolerance (for anonymous reporting) or contact the Office of Diversity, Equity and Access at 217-333-0885 (http://diversity.illinois.edu).
The cultural and resource centers will be available today, tomorrow and after the holiday break for any students who need a safe space for support and conversation.
Our university police department is continuing to monitor this situation, and we will thoroughly investigate and respond to any credible threats. If you ever have any concerns about your personal safety, contact us immediately.

Yesterday, someone created a Facebook page designed to intimidate students who attended the Black Student Solidarity Rally on the Quad. Along with many of you, we immediately reached out to Facebook and asked for the page to be removed. Within three hours, the site was down. Additional versions of the site have been created and subsequently removed. We will continue to voice our concern to Facebook, if the site resurfaces.
That anyone on our campus would think it’s appropriate to create such a site is extremely disturbing. We recognize the right to free speech, and we encourage you to exercise that right when you see examples of racism, discrimination or intimidation on our campus.
The site called for monitoring African American students, and some students are telling us they now feel unsafe. We must have a safe environment for everyone – where people can gather and express concerns without fear; where we can build understanding by truly listening to each other; and where we can benefit from the ideas, talents and perspectives of everyone in our Illinois community.
We are committed to working harder to build a culture of respect and community.

Thanksgiving Break is in arms reach, with the semester soon to follow. I wanted to update you on opportunities and initiatives the Illinois Student Senate is leading.
 
The state budget crisis is dire, and the lack of state funding for Monetary Awards Program (MAP) grants and our University has put us all at a disadvantage. We need your help to ensure that over 6,000 students on our campus receive their MAP grants, and that our University is able to operate without major cuts. Here are some things you can do:

Write a letter to your state representative and state senator. We will provide you with the stamp, letter, and will mail it for you. You can find their names and contact information here. You can find a letter writing guide on this issue here.
Call your legislator's office and let them know that you support higher education and want them to take action to pass funding for MAP and the University of Illinois.
Follow the ""Budget Cuts Mean Us” campaign on Facebook and Twitter to stay updated with the current state of the budget and its effects on higher ed. 
Share your story on Article21.

If you or your RSO are interested in taking action, please reply to this email. We need to come together in this unprecedented time to fight for our peers and our University.
 
In addition, please join me tomorrow, Tuesday, November 17 at 7:00pm in Illini Room A for a public forum where I will talk about current challenges facing students and the university. My team will take your questions and solicit your thoughts and ideas. We hope you can join us! Join the Facebook event here.
 
Lastly, the Illinois Student Senate is proposing a new constitution as a fall referendum. This new document would include a popularly elected President and Vice President and fix some inefficiencies from our current governing document. Please sign our petition to put the document on the ballot. You can find the petition and proposed constitution here.

Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity and several other student organizations organized a vigil on the Quad last Thursday evening. Several campus leaders were invited and we learned a great deal. To those who attended the vigil, thank you again for your words, your honesty, and your dedication to making Illinois a better community for all.
Thursday we heard stories that were inspiring. We also heard stories that angered and disappointed us. We understand that students who experience instances of racism and discrimination find it difficult to consider our campus community as their home.
Universities like ours must be places where all are respected, where everyone believes their voice will be heard, and where views may be freely and safely expressed and debated. This year, events on campuses across the nation have called attention once again to the fact that much work still needs to be done to meet those standards. As your Chancellor, Provost and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, we want you to know that we are committed to doing that work here. In the coming weeks, we will be communicating regularly with the campus about our ongoing initiatives and new actions we are considering. We ask for your continued partnership in this important work.
As the vigil once again demonstrated, our students are courageous in calling attention to the challenges we face in making this a campus that is truly welcoming to all people regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic background. It is our responsibility to take what we hear and work with the campus community as a whole—all faculty, students, and staff—to implement changes that will lead to far fewer stories that outrage and many more that inspire.

Since our founding nearly 150 years ago, this University has been committed to world-class educational opportunities that often take our students and faculty around the world, providing once-in-a-lifetime study and life experiences. We are fully committed to open, inclusive and safe learning environments. These troubled times, however, require extraordinary vigilance.

President Tim Killeen is leading a university-wide strategic planning initiative to help set goals for our system for the next five years. To support the effort, he is holding town halls, as well as office hours on each of the three campuses. The Urbana town hall is on Wednesday, November 18, from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. in the Beckman Auditorium, and the office hours are from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. on Thursday, November 19, in the South Lounge of the Illini Union.
President Killeen wants to give our campus an opportunity to ask questions about the planning process and provide input to senior staff and members of the steering committee. The conversation will be led by AKA|Strategy (AKA), a consulting firm with broad experience providing strategic counsel to leading institutions and systems of higher education. For non-exempt civil service employees, participation in the town hall is an approved event, meaning that, if the meeting occurs during an employee’s regular work schedule, the employee may attend without loss of pay and without having to charge a benefit. 
If you cannot attend a live stream will be available at https://www.uillinois.edu/strategic_plan/townhalls/.

A few minutes ago, the University of Illinois Board of Trustees voted to approve a negotiated agreement with Dr. Steven Salaita. Under the mutual agreement, Dr. Salaita will receive a lump-sum payment of $600,000 from the university, and he will not join the faculty. In addition, the university will pay his attorneys’ fees. The settlement reflects our belief that Dr. Salaita and his family should be compensated for the financial disruption they experienced.
This agreement represents an important step forward in our efforts to see the AAUP censure lifted – a goal President Tim Killeen and I are both committed to achieving as soon as possible.
I hope this settlement also brings some closure to a difficult and challenging time for our entire community. We have spent a good deal of time debating the decisions of the past. I think we have the chance now to focus our collective energy on bringing the campus back together and on the choices we must make for our future.
I remain focused on our goals of excellence in teaching, research and public engagement, and I am satisfied this agreement will allow Dr. Salaita to move forward with his academic career.

I have asked Senior Associate Athletic Director Paul Kowalczyk to serve as interim director, and he has agreed.
Today, we are releasing the final Franczek Radelet P.C. reports into allegations related to sports medicine and scholarship management in our football program and women’s basketball programs. There were no findings of misconduct by the director of athletics and no violations of policies or standards by him in this review. But, I believe that in order to move forward and put the focus of the athletics program back on the success of student-athletes, a change in leadership is needed. These reports can be found at: http://go.illinois.edu/athleticreviewreports
DIA has achieved much under Mike’s leadership, including significant milestones in fundraising and steady improvements in the academic performance of our student-athletes. I am grateful to Mike for the work he has done at Illinois.
Decisions such as these are always difficult, but we all remain focused on the best interests of our student-athletes, and this decision allows everyone to move forward.
Regards,
Barbara J. WilsonInterim Chancellor"

Not long after we sent out today’s earlier Campus Safety Notice regarding a pepper-spray incident on the Quad, we received information helping us to identify the juvenile offender and others who were with that person at the time. We are continuing to investigate, and we may post further updates as necessary at police.illinois.edu.
I would also like to thank our campus community for working with us to identify those pictured in the security camera images we released with the earlier Campus Safety Notice. Public safety is a community effort, and police rely on the active participation of everyone on campus to look out for each other. It is exactly this kind of cooperation which makes our community safer.
We have a very safe campus, but every Campus Safety Notice we issue is an important reminder that a community of our size will never be entirely crime-free. The recent notices we have issued are unrelated and are not indicative of any kind of trend or increase in crime. However, it is always important that we take a minute to review resources which can keep you safe on campus and anywhere else you may go.
Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks escort if you need one, or download the app for iOS or Android.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This Campus Safety Notice is issued in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about crime to aid in the prevention of similar crimes and to assist in the identification of offenders.
This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, please visit CrimeReports.com.
The following aggravated battery took place at 6 p.m. on Monday, November 2, just south of the Illini Union, 1401 W. Green St. (map), in Urbana:
A U. of I. student was walking in the northwest area of the Quad when she was approached by a group of four women, one of whom pepper sprayed the student in the face. The offenders ran toward Wright Street from the Quad. The student was not seriously injured.
U of I. security cameras captured images of the four offenders, and police are seeking the community’s help in identifying the women. Those pictures can be viewed here: https://illinois.edu/blog/view/6221/273163.
The University of Illinois Police Department has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area, and we are fortunate to have our force supplemented by the Urbana and Champaign police departments. Between these agencies, the Urbana campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 1,000 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216.

The following Aggravated Battery took place at 1:08 a.m. on Sunday, November 1, 2015, in Parking Lot C-7, 801 S. Sixth St., (map) in Champaign. According to a police report, the victim was walking in the second level of Parking Lot C7 when the offender struck him in the eye. A witness reported that there were three subjects near the victim prior to hearing one of them strike the victim. When he looked over to the victim, the three subjects got into a vehicle and drove from the area. The victim was transported to the hospital with an injury above his eye.
One of the subjects is described as a white male, approximately 25-30 years old, 6 feet 2 inches tall, weighing approximately 210 pounds. The subject had red hair and a beard. No further descriptions of the other two are currently available. The offender left in a white Dodge Charger, believed to be a model between 2011-2013.

In August, the University of Illinois Board of Trustees approved the formal agreement establishing the Carle Illinois College of Medicine in partnership with the Carle Health System. Part of that approval required the completion of four deliverables related to joint research practices and governance. These were completed last week.
Carle and Illinois have taken a significant new step forward in creating the first medical college born at the intersection of engineering and medicine.
The future of human health care depends on revolutionary advances in the life sciences, technology, information and other disciplines in ways no one has even imagined. No other institution in the world is better positioned to start that revolution right now.
The four deliverables completed this week include:
Research Affiliation Agreement
Translational Research Agreement
Hiring Practices Guidelines
Joint Liaison Committee Charter
The search committee to select the inaugural dean has been named and we expect the national search to launch within weeks. Committees developing the new curriculum and navigating the Liaison Committee on Medical Education accreditation and Illinois Board of Higher Education approval processes will soon be underway.
Our collective focus is now on recruiting our new college leadership, establishing the groundbreaking curriculum, securing the necessary financial resources and bringing together the faculty and physicians who will teach the first class of students in the fall of 2018.
We are no longer simply designing the first college of its kind. With our Carle partners, we are now immersed in the exciting and hard work of building it.
Thank you for your support.

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes.
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes. We are not including certain details in this alert so as to avoid releasing identifying information about the victim.
The University of Illinois Police Department has received a report that a student was sexually assaulted at 4:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 28, in a University residence hall by a person known to the victim.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to assist those involved in this incident and will continue to take actions to maintain the safety and security of the campus community.
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit WeCare.illinois.edu.
If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another person, intervene if it’s safe to do so or call for assistance.
While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. For more information about reporting rape, please visit WeCare.illinois.edu.
Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.
It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.

Our campus recognizes the urgent need to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. We do this to help mitigate climate change and to be better stewards of the environment. We intend to serve as a model for campuses and communities around the world, while educating the next generation of sustainability leaders.
We have made great strides in the sustainability of our campus operations in recent years, and I am excited to present the 2015 Illinois Climate Action Plan (iCAP), building on these successes. It reaffirms our commitment to become carbon neutral as soon as possible, no later than 2050 and perhaps as early as 2035.
This plan requires the dedicated and sustained efforts of our faculty, students and staff to identify and implement the best sustainability solutions for our campus. Many of these solutions will require strategic up-front investments but will save money in the longer term.
Given the current budget uncertainty, we have a responsibility to carefully weigh the costs and benefits of any solutions. But we must consider all of our options.
The Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment (iSEE) has a web page with suggestions for how you can get involved, and I invite you to attend the iCAP Forum on the plan at 1 p.m. this Wednesday, Oct. 21, in Illini Union Room A.

Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:I am pleased to report that the University-wide strategic plan is progressing and ask that you “hold the date” for town hall meetings next month on each campus -- an opportunity for you to participate in the strategic planning process.Each session will take place from 3 to 5 p.m. and will be held Nov. 9 on the Springfield campus, Brookens Auditorium; Nov. 18 on the Urbana-Champaign campus, Beckman Auditorium; and Nov. 30 on the Chicago campus, Student Center East.I will be at each session along with the campus chancellor, and we look forward to robust and thoughtful discussions about the future of our three University campuses. As I said at the outset of this initiative, our vision will be far-reaching and its foundation will be wholly student-centered.The town hall meetings will be augmented by smaller group discussions intended to gain insights and perspective from University constituencies with common interests, such as units devoted to student affairs or the same academic disciplines. And there will be some open-door sessions at which people can drop by and say what’s on their mind in an audience-free zone.The goal continues to be a concise and highly impactful plan for the University’s future to be recommended for Board of Trustees approval next spring. Guiding our work is a 22-member steering committee of students, faculty and staff from across the U of I system. A strategic planning website has been established. On the website is a list of steering committee members, a process timeline, summaries of planning retreats held this past summer, and background materials that make for some stimulating reading.And there is my favorite feature of the website: “Your Input-Your Story.” It is a clever exercise to tell an insightful story in six words. You are invited to share with the steering committee your six-word story about the vibrant future you’d like to see for the University of Illinois.I encourage you to be involved in the strategic planning initiative, and I look forward to seeing you next month.Sincerely,Tim"

I write to share the bittersweet news that Susan Kies has decided to retire as Secretary of the Board of Trustees and of the University effective next July 1. She is ending a 22-year run with her alma mater that will be remembered for her verve, professionalism, kindness and good humor. It is a loss for those of us here who rely on Susan, but it will be sweet for Susan and her family.
Since becoming University Secretary in 2011, Susan has been a loyal and respected colleague of three University presidents and the Board of Trustees, as well as campus and faculty leadership across our three campuses.
The office of the Secretary is a central cog in the governance and administration of the University. During her tenure, Susan and her staff have fulfilled their critical roles while also adapting new technology that has made the office more efficient, effective and transparent.
Susan earned her bachelor’s degree at the Urbana-Champaign campus and returned to the U of I after receiving master’s and doctoral degrees at Oklahoma State University. She joined the U of I College of Medicine regional campus at Urbana-Champaign in 1993 and served in faculty and administrative roles, becoming associate dean for academic affairs/curriculum development. Her work in the College introduced her to colleagues and issues at medical campuses in Chicago, Peoria and Rockford as well, making her well acquainted with the scale and diversity of the U of I system.
It will be a challenging task to find a replacement for Susan, and I will announce plans for a search to fill the position at a later date. We hope to identify Susan’s successor in time to allow some overlap with Susan to facilitate a smooth transition.
I know you join me in wishing Susan and her husband, Roy Wilcox, her children and grandchildren a joyful time when she begins her retirement next summer. In the meantime, we look forward to working with her and I hope you will use those opportunities to thank her for her loyal service to this great university.
Sincerely,Tim"

Dear colleagues:
Today, Illinois begins its fourth month without a state budget.
The University of Illinois has managed through the ongoing impasse that has shut off funding from the state. Through efficiencies and careful financial management, we have maintained operations without disruption to students, and we will continue to honor all commitments to employees and vendors.
But operating without a critical source of funding is not sustainable in the long term. Already, we have significant vouchers for traditionally eligible expenses that cannot be submitted because there is no budget for fiscal 2016. Other public universities across the state also face shortfalls that will continue to grow as the stalemate lingers.
So, today, I joined the presidents of the state’s nine public universities in signing a letter to Governor Rauner and our legislative leaders, urging them to end the impasse before it does serious harm to the public higher education campuses that are vital to the state’s future. A copy of the letter is available online: http://go.uillinois.edu/October1BudgetUpdate.
Collectively, our state’s public universities are large-scale incubators of the highly skilled workforce and groundbreaking innovation that are central to prosperity and economic growth in the 21st century. But the funding lapse poses threats for both the current academic year and for our future.
The letter sent to the governor and legislative leaders seeks face-to-face meetings to discuss sensible solutions to the impasse and to make our case collectively for robust, appropriate and predictable funding.
In the meantime, our coalition of public university leaders is stepping up advocacy efforts – meeting with legislators in Springfield and in their districts and mounting grassroots campaigns that encourage students, alumni, faculty, staff and friends to join with us in articulating the value of public higher education for Illinois. I will provide updates as our efforts continue.
I want to assure you that the University of Illinois will continue to do whatever it takes to maintain, preserve and extend our reputation for excellence during this period of budgetary uncertainty and stress.
As always, I am deeply grateful for your commitment to the University of Illinois and for your patience, understanding and support during these uncertain times.
Sincerely,Tim"

Earlier this month, the University of Illinois Board of Trustees approved a policy requiring criminal background checks for new hires, to take effect on Oct. 5. Last week, our Academic Senate passed a resolution urging a delay in implementation of the policy.
U of I President Timothy Killeen conferred with the Board chair and trustees who chair the Board governance and academic affairs committees. On Friday, President Killeen notified the campus that he and the Board leadership agreed to extend the implementation deadline for the Urbana campus to Nov. 1. During this period, the Office of the Provost and the Senate Executive Committee will work together to ensure our background check implementation procedures will be fair and nondiscriminatory to applicants while protecting the safety of our students and employees. Going forward, we will be monitoring our implementation closely and assessing its impact on our hiring.
Please note that during the four-week period, subject to very limited exceptions, hires cannot be finalized on the Urbana campus unless a background check is conducted. If your unit has questions about the policy, please contact Elyne Cole in the Office of the Provost at 333-6677 or Deb Stone in Academic Human Resources at 333-7466. If you have questions about a specific position or search, please contact Yulee Kim in Academic Human Resources at 333-6747 or Chris Carr in Staff Human Resources at 333-2137.
In the meantime, Vice President for Academic Affairs Christophe Pierre will chair an ad hoc group with employees from all three campuses to review the policy and suggest potential revisions that could be recommended to the Board for consideration.
We want to thank the Board and President Killeen for responding to the Academic Senate in a manner that supports shared governance, and we thank the Senate Executive Committee in advance for collaborating with us to complete this work in time for the Nov. 1 implementation.
Sincerely,
Barbara J. Wilson, Interim Chancellor

As Chancellor, I am responsible for annually affirming our campus commitment to equal opportunity, affirmative action, and equal access.  This commitment is consistent with my unwavering belief that diversity is central to our mission.  Campus policies prohibit discrimination or harassment of any member of the campus community during any stage of the employment process.  Our affirmative action plan also requires the campus to undertake good faith efforts to increase the representation of women, minorities, persons with disabilities, and protected veterans.  In addition, as part of our compliance with Title IX, the campus prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in employment as well as in admissions, enrollment, and in the provision of all services, programs and activities. The Title IX Office in the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Access oversees and supports the campus commitment to responding to reported incidents of sexual assault, and as part of that process we have created a new website called WeCare (www.wecare.illinois.edu).
I encourage each of you to join me in supporting our campus commitment to diversity and to fostering a welcoming and inclusive community of students, faculty, and staff.  In that spirit, I hope you will participate in events and programs being held from September 26th through October 2nd as part of iunite/Inclusive Illinois week (https://oiir.illinois.edu/events/iunite2015).

Following yesterday’s meeting of the Academic Senate, I wanted to share a few of the points I made in my opening remarks.
As interim chancellor my goals for this year are pretty straightforward:
I will work to restore trust across the campus – among our faculty and staff, between faculty and campus leadership and between the students and those of us here to serve them.
I will communicate broadly and often and consult widely about the decisions we need to make together to keep the campus moving forward this year.
I want to see the AAUP censure lifted.
The development of the Carle Illinois College of Medicine will continue with the full support of the campus.
I will do everything in my power to ensure that we attract the best and most talented candidates to be our next permanent chancellor.
I know there are still plenty of issues on the horizon – the state budget situation being the most pressing among them – but I hope you get to see how much good news this campus has to celebrate.
We welcomed a bright and talented new undergraduate class this year.
Numbering 7,565, they are the second largest in our history.
More than 5,000 are Illinois residents – an increase of almost 600 in-state students over last year.
17.1% are from underrepresented minorities, with notable increases over 2014 in the number of African-American and Latina/o students joining our class.
More than one in five of our freshmen are first generation college students – continuing our long tradition of accessible educational opportunities.
And once again, they excel academically, bringing with them an average ACT of 28.5 and average SAT of 1361.

We welcomed a strong new group of tenure and tenure-track faculty, with more than 120 new hires joining our community. Looking ahead, 120 new and continuing searches are authorized for this year.
We saw our annual rank in the US News move up one place among all universities, putting us 11th among our national public peers.
The campus hosted visits by the U.S. Secretaries of Agriculture and Education in the space of one week.
This is a great university and the excellence here comes from the work you all do every day in the classrooms, laboratories, recital halls, libraries and throughout our communities.
Thank you for your optimism and your enthusiasm.
Best,
Barbara J. WilsonInterim Chancellor"

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes.
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes. We are not including certain details in this alert so as to avoid releasing identifying information about the victim.
The University of Illinois Police Department has received a report that a student was sexually assaulted Sunday, September 20, at an on campus apartment in Urbana by a person known to the victim.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to assist those involved in this incident and will continue to take actions to maintain the safety and security of the campus community.
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit WeCare.illinois.edu.
If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another person, intervene if it’s safe to do so or call for assistance.
While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. For more information about reporting rape, please visit WeCare.illinois.edu.
Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.
It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.

The following arson took place at 9:38 p.m. on Sunday, September 20, at Wardall Hall, 1010 W. Illinois St., (map) in Urbana: The Urbana Fire Department was dispatched to a small fire on the 8th floor of the building. Someone set papers on a cork board on fire.  The fire was extinguished by the time firefighters arrived. This is the second incident to occur on this floor within a week. 
At 9:45 p.m. on Monday, September 14, a small fire on the 8th floor of the building was extinguished by a resident.  Someone set papers in a recycling bin on fire.  Investigators believe both fires were set intentionally. No one was injured in either incident.
Anyone with information about these incidents is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216.

This is our community. Let's stay together.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University's Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan guidelinesprotect you from legal or disciplinary consequences when you take the appropriate action to ensure others' safety.
If you hear or see a fire alarm, leave the building immediately. Just because you cannot see flames or smoke does not mean you are safe – a fire or other hazard could be in another part of the building and rapidly spread to where you are.

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign recently completed a test of our emergency response and evacuation plans. The test included two components: a drill and an exercise. The drill (a test of our Illini-Alert emergency notification system) was initiated on Sept. 1 at 10:05 a.m. This drill was announced ahead of time by campus Massmail and an e-week notice. The Illini-Alert system sent an email to the illinois.edu addresses of all active faculty, staff and students. Those who have registered alternate email addresses also received an email notification. Those who have registered a cellphone number were sent a text message during this drill.
In an attempt to increase the speed and breadth of emergency communications, the campus increased Illini-Alert modes of emergency communication to include Facebook, Twitter and our Emergency Web Alert System. This multi-modal approach provides a robust communication engine that will continue to function successfully even if one system fails to work properly.
If you have not signed up to receive emergency messages through Illini-Alert, please visit http://emergency.illinois.edu/ to register.
The second component of the test was a tabletop exercise conducted Sept. 2 from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Illinois Fire Service Institute. The exercise was announced in advance via a campus e-week notice. The tabletop exercise involved an active shooter scenario that directly affected campus. The exercise scenario tested various components of the Campus Emergency Operations Plan, including evacuation procedures.
To view the University’s emergency response and evacuation procedures, please visit http://www.dps.illinois.edu/emergencyplanning/evacproc.html.
The Division of Public Safety hopes this information is useful to all those who work, study, and visit our campus community.

In May 2015, we announced that modifications would be made to our Smoke-Free Campus Policy in accordance with the State of Illinois Smoke-Free Campus Act (110 ILCS64/1-99).  This law requires all public institutions of higher education in Illinois to prohibit smoking on campus property and to enforce prohibition through disciplinary action and fines.
The University of Illinois Police Department (UIPD), along with campus security personnel under their supervision, will enforce the Smoke-Free Campus Policy as follows:
First violation: Written warning
Second violation: $25 fine. Note that this fine can be waived by completing an online educational program
Third violation: $50 fine
Fourth violation and beyond: $100 fine for each occurrence
To report violations, please call UIPD’s non-emergency telephone number at 217-333-8911 so that a patrol car may be dispatched.
As required by the act, the scope of campus property covered by the policy has been expanded. Smoking is now prohibited on all property owned, leased, occupied or controlled by the campus, including Willard Airport and other areas outside of the main campus.  Please refer to the Smoke-Free Campus map which illustrates campus property boundaries.
The University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign has been at the forefront of going smoke-free and we remain committed to building a culture of health and voluntary compliance.  Help is available for those who would like to quit tobacco and for smokers who need help managing tobacco cravings while on campus.  More information about these resources can be found on the Smoke-Free Campus website.
Thank you for your support of this policy and caring about the well-being of our campus community.
Sincerely,
C. Renée RomanoVice Chancellor for Student Affairs"

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This Campus Safety Notice is issued in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about crime to aid in the prevention of similar crimes and to assist in the identification of offenders.
This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, please visit CrimeReports.com.
The following attempted robbery took place at 2:39 a.m. on Saturday, September 5, 2015, near the intersection of Dorner and Gregory drives in Urbana (map): 
A group of people were walking north on Dorner Drive when they were approached by a small group of offenders who had been driving in a white, newer model four-door sedan (possibly a Pontiac) with a large sunroof. One of the offenders stopped one of the people and asked for his money. The offenders did not display a weapon. All of the individuals fled the area and were not injured.
The first offender was described as a heavyset black male with short hair, possibly 25 years old, 5 feet, 5 inches tall, weighing more than 250 pounds and was wearing a gray tank top. The second offender was described as a thin black male, about 25 years old, 6 feet, 2 inches tall, and wearing a white T-shirt. The third offender was about 5 feet, 11 inches tall, muscularly built and was wearing a dark-colored T-shirt.
Security cameras captured footage of the suspect vehicle. Images of the vehicle can be viewed at http://illinois.edu/lb/article/2668/94278/page=1/list=list?skinId=3365.
Information about the race or ethnicity of alleged offenders is provided only to aid detailed descriptions that include physical stature, clothing or unusual characteristics. Racial descriptions do not, by themselves, offer a meaningful picture of an individual’s appearance.
The University of Illinois Police Department has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area, and we are fortunate to have our force supplemented by the Urbana and Champaign police departments. Between these agencies, the Urbana campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 1,000 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS) or by visiting www.373tips.com. Anonymous tips may also be sent via text message by texting keyword ""CCTIP"" plus the information to 274637 (CRIMES).
This is our community. Let's stay together.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks  escort if you need one, or download the app for iOS or Android.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.
If you choose to consume alcohol, please be responsible. Remember your ability to respond is diminished by overconsumption of alcohol.

2015-09-03T17:18:00Z,2015-09-03,17:18,26365,Appointment of Edward Feser as Vice Chancellor for Academic...,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/27530.html,"Dear Colleagues,
I am very pleased to name Edward J. Feser, dean of the College of Fine and Applied Arts, as vice chancellor for academic affairs and provost designate. Dean Feser has the knowledge, experience, respect and demeanor necessary to help address the many issues before us.
As I told you earlier this week, I consulted broadly during the selection process, receiving input from more than 60 people – including 35 face-to-face meetings – with deans, institute directors, tenure-system and specialized faculty, administrators and students. Dean Feser’s name was suggested by many, and the qualities they see in him include:
an appreciation of the breadth and comprehensive excellence of the campus
a deep and sophisticated understanding of academic budgets
an ability to bring people with disparate views together
a calming demeanor
a fair approach to decision making
a keen ability to articulate the strengths of the campus
the wisdom and experience to guide several dean searches in the coming year
Dean Feser joined the university in 2004 as a professor of urban and regional planning, and he served as department head of that unit for several years before being recruited for an endowed faculty position in the Manchester Business School at the University of Manchester. The campus was fortunate to attract him back to Illinois in 2012 as the dean of our College of Fine and Applied Arts, a position he has held for almost three years. As dean, Feser has been a driving force in building and supporting innovation, collaboration and creative work in the College.
Dean Feser earned a bachelor of arts in government at the University of San Francisco (1989); a master's in regional planning at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (1995); and a doctorate in regional planning, also at UNC (1997).
Before coming to Illinois, Dean Feser was a faculty member in the Department of City and Regional Planning at UNC for seven years. He also was a visiting research fellow in the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and in the Center for Economic Studies in the U.S. Census.
His research focuses on technology-based regional economic development, institutional innovation in public sector organizations, and policies supporting urban and business development.   His work has been supported by the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Economic Development Administration, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He has authored more than 70 scholarly articles, chapters and technical reports. He has won several teaching awards and was named a University Scholar at Illinois in 2007.
Dean Feser has named Kathleen Harleman, director of Krannert Art Museum and faculty member in the School of Art and Design, to serve as acting dean until he is able to resume his duties at FAA. He also has named Kevin Hamilton, professor in the School of Art and Design, as senior associate dean to handle research support efforts, promotion, tenure and faculty affairs.
I am grateful to Ed for his willingness to take on the vice chancellor for academic affairs and provost designate position and I very much look forward to working with him. Together, we pledge to work tirelessly on behalf of the campus during this transitional period. 
Sincerely,
Barbara J. WilsonActing Chancellor"
2015-09-01T09:22:00Z,2015-09-01,9:22,17341,Update on Interim Provost,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/27527.html,"Dear Colleagues,
Since last week’s announcement that Provost Adesida was stepping out of his position, I have been working hard on selecting an interim. To help me with this crucial decision, I have been consulting extensively with deans, faculty, staff, administrators and students across the campus. I’ve asked them to offer their suggestions both on possible candidates as well as their perspectives on the key issues they believe our provost will need to address effectively this year.
So far I’ve consulted with more than 60 individuals who have offered ideas and guidance. Dealing with our budget, continuing to move forward on the new College of Medicine, finding ways to heal the divisions of the past year and ensuring continued progress in several upcoming dean searches are the key issues that are consistently emerging in these conversations.
I am benefitting greatly from these discussions and I hope to name an interim provost in the next few days. I hope you agree that it is critical to take the necessary time to ensure that we get the best person in this role to help the campus move forward.
Best,
Barbara J. WilsonActing Chancellor"
2015-08-28T14:07:00Z,2015-08-28,14:7,35222,Welcome Letter from the Dean of Students,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/27525.html,"Welcome new and returning students to the University of Illinois 2015-16 academic year. Because the University of Illinois cares about your health, safety and success, as well as the welfare of our academic community, we are concerned about those students who choose to engage in high-risk drinking. Such excessive alcohol consumption can lead to serious negative consequences, not only for those who are drinking but also for those around them.  
Surveys of Illinois students indicate that most students do not drink at all, or do so infrequently. However, we acknowledge that this community allows 19-year-olds to enter bars, even though Illinois’ legal drinking age is 21. We also know that some students develop a relationship with alcohol and other substances that may not serve them well, a relationship that may undermine their plans for the future. Because the university is invested in maintaining a safe and caring community for all, we would like to bring the following to your attention:
The university has developed a series of programs, policies, and services to address alcohol and other drug abuse,   including the first-year program Alcohol Culture Explored Interactive Theatre (ACE-IT). Please consult our new website “Rethink the Drink” at http://www.rethinkthedrink.illinois.edu for a list of resources available to students.
As students, you are expected to comply with the law and to adhere to the standards of the Student Code (http://studentcode.illinois.edu), both on and off campus. Violations of the law or of university policies governing alcohol and other drug use may result in citations or arrest by the police as well as disciplinary sanctions through the Office for Student Conflict Resolution.  
Please remember that the recreational use of marijuana remains illegal in Illinois and at the federal level on campuses throughout the U.S.
You may be aware that our campus has formal guidelines regarding medical amnesty and the actions of “good Samaritans.” This protocol provides the opportunity for you to call for medical help on behalf of yourself or others who may be in danger as a result of high-risk behavior. In doing so, the student will not be subject to university disciplinary action, but will still be expected to comply with the remaining components of our approach to high-risk behavior, possibly including an educational intervention. This protocol is intended to help students take the right action and call for help, for themselves or another person, without loss of standing with the university. To review this Call, Stay, Cooperate protocol in its entirety, please visit http://www.conflictresolution.illinois.edu/.
If you have questions about policies on alcohol use or our efforts to reduce high-risk drinking, contact the Counseling Center’s Alcohol and Other Drug Office (217-333-7557) or the Office for Student Conflict Resolution (217-333-3680).
The university takes your health, safety, and academic success very seriously. We are also serious about using every resource at our disposal to ensure that all students have a positive and healthy experience during their time at the University of Illinois.
We are excited that you are here, and we wish you every success in the 2015-16 academic year.
Sincerely
Ken Ballom
Dean of Students and Associate Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs"

With classes beginning, it is important that we all take a moment to review some basic guidelines that can help protect us while we’re on campus. Given that there have been several crimes reported near campus within the past two weeks, we want you to have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, please visit CrimeReports.com.
The Champaign Police Department has informed University of Illinois Police of the following off-campus incidents and recently requested that we issue this message to enhance your safety going forward.
At 5:03 a.m. in the 0-100 block of East John Street, Champaign, two men entered an unlocked apartment and took electronics and a wallet. One of the two men was arrested.
Sometime on Aug. 16 or Aug. 17 in the 100 block of East Chalmers Street, Champaign, a backpack containing a laptop and watch was stolen from an unlocked vehicle.
At 11:51 p.m. on Aug. 20 near Fifth and White streets, Champaign, a man shoved a woman to the ground, demanded money and then ran away.
A series of robberies were reported on Aug. 22. At 12:19 a.m. in the 400 block of East Stoughton Street, Champaign, a man came up from behind the victim, pressed an unknown object against the victim’s head and demanded money. The offender fled after the victim gave him cash. At 1:13 a.m. in the 300 block of East White Street, Champaign, an offender with a knife demanded money from a man and ran away after receiving cash. At 5:23 a.m. near Fourth and White streets, Champaign, a man approached a group of people and demanded money. The victims turned over a small amount of cash and the man walked away. No weapon was seen, but the man kept touching his leg as to imply he had a weapon.

2015-08-25T06:40:00Z,2015-08-25,6:40,56875,Welcome students,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/27518.html,"August 25, 2015
Dear students:
It is a pleasure and honor to join our three great campuses in welcoming you to the University of Illinois.
The start of a new academic year is a special time, when our campuses come alive again after the relative quiet of summer. This fall promises to be busier than ever. We expect nearly 79,000 students university-wide, a new enrollment record and more than the entire population of Illinois’ 12th largest city, Bloomington.
This year’s fall semester is especially meaningful to me. It is my first as president of this remarkable university, with roots that stretch back nearly 150 years to a stroke of President Abraham Lincoln’s pen that created public land-grant universities and made higher education in America a model for the world.
I came for the same reasons that attracted all of you – a chance to be part of a university recognized globally as a leader in education and discovery; a university that has helped fulfill the dreams of more than 700,000 living graduates whose successes are testaments to its excellence.
Students are the very core of our mission and my presidency is dedicated to all of you. With campus leadership, faculty and staff, I will work to ensure the educational experience that has been transforming lives for generations continues for generations to come and that a U of I degree is forever synonymous with pride, respect and opportunity.
Each of you will ultimately add to our rich legacy, through the talents you foster here. Take advantage of everything the university has to offer, in the classroom and out. What you learn here will serve you for a lifetime. Enjoy the ride, and don’t forget to have some fun along the way.
I wish you all the best and I thank you and your family for choosing the University of Illinois.
Sincerely,
Tim KilleenPresident"

I write to let you know that this morning Provost Ilesanmi Adesida has informed me that he will be stepping down from this role and returning to his faculty position in the College of Engineering on August 31.
I want to thank Provost Adesida for his tremendous dedication to this campus and for his visionary leadership over many years. I worked with him in the Office of the Provost for two years and for this past year as a dean. I have seen firsthand how much this university means to him and how much pride he took in seeing the successes of our faculty, students and alumni.
For almost three decades, Ade has been an integral part of this university. As a highly accomplished faculty member in engineering, the director of the Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory, as a dean and as provost, he has been a tireless advocate for Illinois. He has been a voice for us all across the nation and around the world. And closer to home, his leadership can be seen in everything from our ambitious plans to hire 500 new faculty members to this summer’s formal approval of the Carle Illinois College of Medicine to the plans for our new student design center.
Ade ranks among the most respected members of his profession in the world. He holds memberships in the most prestigious societies including the National Academy of Engineering and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He is a prolific scholar, a valued collaborator and an honored mentor and advisor.
Ade has left a permanent and positive mark on this university. He has my respect and my gratitude. Replacing him will be no easy task.
I will be consulting with the Council of Deans, members of the Senate Executive Committee and leaders across campus in the next few days for advice and guidance in selecting a candidate to serve in an interim capacity. This is a critical position for the campus that we must fill quickly, but a decision that I know must be made collaboratively.
Once again, I ask you to join me in thanking Provost Adesida for his service and wish him the best as he returns to his faculty position.
Sincerely,
Barbara J. WilsonActing Chancellor"

2015-08-24T12:30:00Z,2015-08-24,12:30,74838,Mumps Vaccinations - August 26 & 27,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/27515.html,"To the University Community,
Mumps infections among University students on this campus have occurred throughout the past summer, and additional cases continue to occur in our community. McKinley Health Center is concerned that the infection may spread further, potentially causing severe discomfort to individuals and interfering with the myriad of activities that go along with the start of another year on this great campus.
There are some steps each of us can take to protect ourselves and other members of our community.
Learn about mumps from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Seek care if you think you may have mumps. Students may call McKinley’s Dial-A-Nurse at (217) 333-2700 to talk about their symptoms or arrange a visit. Faculty and staff should contact their medical provider if care or advice is needed. 
If you have not already done so, all students should get a third MMR vaccination as soon as possible. Many students have two vaccinations, in compliance with Illinois state law regarding attendance at schools and universities, and this booster shot further decreases your likelihood of acquiring and transmitting the virus. (Such requirements vary in other states and countries.) 
The relatively few students who have an existing waiver for compliance with the required MMR vaccination should consider whether your reasons for seeking the exemption outweigh the significantly higher risk of severe illness that people with no previous vaccine face. 
Follow a few simple steps to limit the spread of infection. Wash your hands often. Avoid unnecessary physical contact (maybe hold off on the handshake for a while). Do not share eating utensils and common foods at events (especially no double-dipping). Try to maintain a six-foot distance from other individuals (which admittedly isn’t possible in many classroom environments), and always avoid individuals who are sick during times of outbreak. Likewise, cough etiquette is important. Avoiding unnecessary crowds is also helpful.
In order to make it convenient to receive the third MMR vaccination, McKinley is working with the Champaign Urbana Public Health District to provide a special two-day MMR vaccination clinic at the Illini Union Ballroom on Wednesday Aug. 26, and Thursday Aug. 27, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Students, faculty members and staff born after 1956 are encouraged to get the recommended third MMR vaccination if they have not already done so. University faculty and staff may also use the special vaccination clinic after consulting with their physician. The vaccination will be provided at no cost. Individuals wishing to participate should bring their U. of I. ID cards.
In consideration of the serious impact this outbreak poses to the campus, students who are considered to be at risk of infection as a result of potential exposure and who lack adequate vaccination protection are subject to restriction (exclusion) of activities within the community, including class, other events and housing for a period which may extend for several weeks.
Thank you for doing all you can to help manage this illness and to limit its impact on our daily lives.
Dr. Robert PalinkasDirector, McKinley Health Center

As most of you know by now, President Timothy Killeen has appointed me as the acting chancellor of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and acting vice president of the University. I will hold this position until a national search is conducted and our next permanent leader is in place. I also will continue to serve as dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences during this period.
As a member of the faculty here for the past 15 years, I am both personally and professionally invested in this university. I get to see, firsthand, every day, the amazing contributions and accomplishments of our students, faculty and staff. I am honored that President Killeen has asked me to serve in this transitional role. I also am fully aware of the difficult circumstances that led to this charge, and I understand the high expectations all of you have for anyone serving in this position.
My job now is to work with the entire campus community and with our alumni and friends to navigate this leadership transition in ways that are collaborative and collegial and that reinforce the traditions of shared governance that are Illinois hallmarks. Together, I hope we can ensure that this year is one that carries our momentum of accomplishments and innovations forward.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has never been about a single individual. Our presidents, chancellors, provosts and deans have changed over the years, but what has never wavered is the record of world-changing discoveries and educational excellence that are the hallmarks of this incredible university. We were founded with a spirit of optimism and the promise that a college education would be accessible to anyone who had the determination to learn.
Next week the energy and excitement of more than 45,000 students will launch our new academic year. Our students are among the brightest and most talented of their generation. They deserve nothing less than our very best efforts.
I look forward to working with you and I am grateful for the chance to serve as your acting chancellor this academic year.
Sincerely,
Barbara J. WilsonActing Chancellor"

I hope you will join me in welcoming Barbara Wilson on her first full day as acting chancellor of the Urbana-Champaign campus.
Dr. Wilson brings nearly three decades of experience in public higher education, including 15 years as a faculty member and administrator in multiple roles on the Urbana campus. Her superb talent, loyalty and willingness to serve make her an ideal leader at this important moment in time.
As an educator first and foremost, she understands the intersections among the disciplines and can fully represent a comprehensive, magnificent campus. I am deeply grateful for her willingness to share her talents as acting chancellor, while continuing in her role as dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, during our search for a permanent chancellor.
This change in leadership comes on the heels of difficult times. Over the last several months, the University has found itself in the news not always for its world-class excellence in teaching and research, but for a series of allegations and incidents that have been hard on all of us.
Such attention in no way reflects who we really are or the core missions that have earned us a place among the world’s most accomplished and respected universities. It misrepresents the day-in, day-out commitment of our faculty and staff, the success of our students and alumni, the loyalty of our friends and supporters, and our power to lead the way to progress.
We must, of course, learn from the lessons of our past. Our recent challenges also serve as an opportunity – a chance to reexamine our policies and processes, and rededicate ourselves to the guiding principles of integrity, transparency, service and excellence that built this great University.  It is a time to move forward – with ambition, with aspiration and with recognition of the sheer quality and substance that is the hallmark of the University of Illinois.
I am extremely optimistic about our future and have no doubt we will succeed. Often, the issue of the day may seem overwhelming, leading people to look backward rather than forward. But as I have come to know the University of Illinois in my 88 days on board, I have been struck by a common thread that runs deep among our many stakeholders and will move us ahead – enormous pride in our rich legacy and a passion for an even better tomorrow.
So, we are getting past our challenges and steering the ship on the right course, with excellence and integrity as our main sails.
My thanks again to Dr. Wilson for her leadership, and to all of you for your dedication and support. I look forward to working together as we begin a new academic year that will add to our standing as a global powerhouse – robust in service not only to its students, but to the public good, aiming high. 
Sincerely,
Tim"

The following news release was just issued by President Timothy Killeen, who has asked that it be shared with you.
-----
University of Illinois President Timothy L. Killeen today reassigned the chancellor of the Urbana-Champaign campus, Phyllis M. Wise, and Wise was informed that the Board of Trustees is initiating formal dismissal proceedings against her.
The moves came after the Board of Trustees’ Executive Committee voted not to approve Wise’s resignation and a revised employment agreement.
Killeen also appointed Barbara J. Wilson, dean of the campus’ College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (LAS), as acting chancellor, effective at the close of business today.
Killeen told Wise in a letter that her duties as chancellor and vice president of the University are reassigned effective at the close of business today and that until further notice Wise will report directly to the president as an advisor. The authority to reassign the chancellor is vested in the president by the University Statutes and General Rules.
“Your duties will be as prescribed by me,” Killeen said in the letter. Wise’s salary will be unchanged. “Simultaneously with this, I will be designating, subject to subsequent Board confirmation, an Acting Chancellor/V.P. to perform the duties of Chancellor/V.P. of the Urbana campus.”
In a separate letter signed by Board Chairman Edward L. McMillan, Wise was informed that dismissal proceedings against her are being initiated under Article IX, Section 10, of the University Statutes.
“In the near future, you will be receiving a statement of the reasons for your proposed dismissal as Chancellor, accompanied by the facts in support thereof and upon which such action is based, together with notice of the time and place of the hearing thereon,"" McMillan said in the letter. ""Please be advised that pursuant to Article IX, Section 10 you have the right to appear at the hearing, with counsel if desired, to comment on the reasons and to present evidence. The Board’s decision on this matter will be final.”
Wise, who has been chancellor of the Urbana-Champaign campus and vice president of the University since October 2011, announced her resignation as chancellor last week.
Killeen’s appointment of Wilson as acting chancellor will be considered by the board at its September meeting. Wilson also will continue to serve as LAS dean and said she would not be a candidate for the permanent chancellorship.
Killeen said a search for a permanent chancellor will begin immediately, and the process to assemble a diverse search committee is underway.
Wilson, 57, became the Harry E. Preble Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences in 2014 after having served since 2009 in the Office of the Provost. Her service there included two years as executive vice provost for faculty and academic affairs, providing campus leadership on strategic and financial planning.
Before joining the Urbana campus in 2000, Wilson was a member of the faculty at the University of California, Santa Barbara, for 12 years. A professor of communication, her academic research focuses on the social and psychological effects of media, especially on youth. Wilson is an elected fellow of the International Communication Association and her scholarly work is extensively published, with dozens of books, chapters and articles on a wide range of issues involving the social and psychological effects of media on children.
Wilson is a three-degree alumna of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she earned a bachelor’s degree in journalism and her master’s degree and Ph.D in communication."

Dear colleagues:
I write to make you aware that I will recommend College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (LAS) Dean Barbara J. Wilson as interim chancellor of the Urbana-Champaign campus during a special meeting of the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees scheduled for 2 p.m. today.
If approved by the committee, Wilson would begin her new duties today and would serve during a national search that will begin immediately for a permanent successor to Phyllis Wise, who announced last week that she is resigning as chancellor of the Urbana campus and vice president of the University effective today.
Wilson will continue to serve as dean of LAS and will not be a candidate for the permanent chancellorship.
She joined our faculty in 2000, and has served as dean of the campus’s largest college since 2014. I am deeply grateful to her for agreeing to share her experience and talents to guide the campus as we continue our efforts to make this great University the model for higher education in the 21st century
I am also deeply grateful to all of you for your dedication and support, and hope you will join me in thanking Chancellor Wise for her service and welcoming Dr. Wilson to this new, important role.
Sincerely,
Tim Killeen
President
 
News Release
 
Barbara J. Wilson recommended as interim chancellor of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus
LAS Dean to serve during search for permanent chancellor
August 12, 2015
Killeen said his recommendation of Wilson as interim chancellor followed consultations with representatives of key stakeholder groups that included deans and directors, shared governance bodies, faculty, students, staff, alumni, donors and community members.
Wilson, 57, became the Harry E. Preble Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences in 2014 after having served since 2009 in the Office of the Provost. Her service there included two years as executive vice provost for faculty and academic affairs, providing campus leadership on strategic and financial planning.
Before joining the Urbana campus in 2000, Wilson was a member of the faculty at the University of California, Santa Barbara, for 12 years. A professor of communication, her academic research focuses on the social and psychological effects of media, especially on youth. Wilson is an elected fellow of the International Communication Association and her scholarly work is extensively published, with dozens of books, chapters and articles on a wide range of issues involving the social and psychological effects of media on children.
Wilson is a three-degree alumna of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she earned a bachelor’s degree in journalism and her master’s degree and Ph.D in communication.
“I am honored to be asked to serve in this role,” Wilson said. “As interim chancellor, my focus will be on stability and continuity in the transition to a new permanent chancellor so our faculty, students and staff may concentrate on their work and the fulfillment of our missions.” 
“I look forward to working with the faculty, staff, students, alumni, President Killeen, the trustees and the entire University community to advance Illinois as the preeminent public university in America,” Wilson said.
A native of Appleton, Wis., Wilson and her husband, John Lammers, are the parents of daughters Isabel and Grace.
LAS is the Urbana campus’s largest college, with 11,000 students, more than 60 departments and academic units and a $232 million annual budget.
Established in 1867, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is one of three campuses of the university, which also includes the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and the University of Illinois at Springfield (UIS). The Urbana campus serves approximately 45,000 students through its 17 colleges and institutes and more than 200 undergraduate and graduate programs, with about 3,000 faculty, 8,000 staff and an annual operating budget of about $2 billion.

2015-08-04T11:26:00Z,2015-08-04,11:26,62688,Mumps Vaccinations,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/27499.html,"To Students, Faculty and Staff:
The Illinois Department of Public Health and Champaign-Urbana Public Health District have recommended that students at the University of Illinois at Urbana receive a booster shot of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine as soon as possible, even if they have already received one or two previous vaccinations with the MMR vaccine.
This recommendation is because of continued mumps infection in a number of students through the recent spring semester and summer sessions. Most cases on campus had two previous MMR vaccinations.
The goal is to maximize the number of individuals who have boosted immunity before the beginning of classes this fall. Students who are currently not on campus but planning to take classes on the Urbana campus in the fall should obtain the vaccine as soon as possible from their local provider or pharmacy. Immunity takes two weeks to develop after receiving a vaccination.
In order to facilitate access to this MMR booster shot, McKinley Health Center will operate a two-day special MMR vaccine clinic for students at the ARC Building on Thursday, August 6th and Friday, August 7th from 9 am to 3 pm. As an incentive to encourage a quick response, all University of Illinois students who present a valid ID card will be eligible to obtain the vaccine at that time at no cost.
Students who lack adequate vaccine protection, or those who are considered likely to pass mumps infection to other students, may be restricted from certain university activities, including classes.
For more information about mumps, please visit http://www.mckinley.illinois.edu/handouts/mumps/htm.
Faculty and staff born after 1956 may also choose to receive a booster MMR vaccination, subject to the opinion of their medical provider. Immunizations are generally covered expenses through the University’s employee health plans.
Champaign-Urbana Public Health District will be present at the ARC Building on Thursday, August 6th and Friday, August 7th from 9 am to 3 pm to offer this vaccination to faculty and staff at no charge on those dates.
Information about future vaccination opportunities through McKinley Health Center will be posted at the McKinley website http://www.mckinley.illinois.edu.

2015-08-03T09:37:00Z,2015-08-03,9:37,61352,Sharing the Results of Independent Review,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/27498.html,"Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:
I write to share the results of the independent investigation conducted by the firm of Pugh, Jones & Johnson into recent allegations of racism and abusive behavior within our women’s basketball program.
This investigation has concluded that these allegations are not supported by the information available. The review was extensive, far-reaching and careful – including examination of more than 18,000 documents, 33 interviews, the statements of eight former players, and review of game and practice video footage. A version of the final report (redacted only to protect private information of students and those not employed by the university) has been posted here.
The report does recommend actions for clarifying expectations regarding coaches' conduct, better defining the coach-parent relationship and enhancing resources for student-athletes to report concerns or complaints about their experience at Illinois. We will begin implementing these recommendations immediately.
These actions include implementing a formal coaches' code of conduct, improving processes for student-athletes to report concerns and complaints, and a policy establishing clearer lines for appropriate interaction between coaches and parents or others who act on behalf of student-athletes.
Going forward, we will ensure that our coaches and staff members have a clearer understanding of our core values and expectations, and that our student-athletes never ever feel they have nowhere to go when they have concerns.
Our first priority – in and out of the athletic department – is the health and well-being of our students. We can never have too many ways to help connect them with support.
This has been a challenging time for all of our student athletes, the staff of the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics and for all of us at Illinois. Allegations of this kind are troubling because they do not match our values and they do not align with the vision of this university we all share.
And that is why, when they surfaced, Athletic Director Mike Thomas immediately notified me and asked that the campus conduct this independent investigation.
Student-athletes are a part of our Illinois family and we want to ensure that their experience is fulfilling, and that they are able to work toward an Illinois degree, preparing them for lives of leadership and impact.
A separate evaluation of concerns related to the football program and sports medicine aspects of the women’s basketball program is ongoing and I will be sharing that report with you when I have it.
Sincerely,
Phyllis M. Wise Chancellor"

Dear Colleagues,
We are mid-way through the summer and nearly a month into fiscal 2016, and each week that passes without a state budget from Springfield clouds the near-term future and leaves us unable to finalize the University’s fiscal 2016 operating budget.
Normally by this point we would be completing budgets and plans for the new fiscal and academic year, a checklist that includes the annual salary program for faculty and staff. It is imprudent to determine a 2015-16 salary program without knowing the University’s state appropriation, and we do not know how long the Statehouse budget impasse will last. Nevertheless, we must proceed with the 2015-16 academic personnel appointments, to be presented to the Board of Trustees in September.
Therefore, we are temporarily deferring consideration of a 2015-16 salary program until after the state budget is settled and we know exactly what has been promised as our appropriation. Reappointments will be made at the current salaries. The salary program deferral applies to all personnel regardless of the funding line for the appointment. Once the state budget situation is resolved and the U of I deals with any adjustment in our spending plan that may be required, we will revisit the subject of salaries for 2015-16.
We hope that this period of uncertainty will pass soon. The University continues to respond to all inquiries from the Governor's office and the legislature, and continues to press the case for robust state support for public higher education at each and every opportunity.
Your patience and service to the University of Illinois is deeply appreciated.
Sincerely,
Tim KilleenPresident"

We would like to update you on a recent Crime Alert regarding an armed robbery which reportedly occurred June 29 in the 0-100 block of East Stadium Drive, Champaign. At the time, we told you that a victim was approached by a man who displayed a handgun and demanded the victim’s property.
On Tuesday, July 7, the person who reported the crime was interviewed again by detectives with the University of Illinois Police Department. The individual admitted to fabricating the details of the report. No armed robbery occurred, nor was there an offender armed with a gun. This person, who has no affiliation with the University, was issued a state of Illinois notice to appear in court for filing a false police report because of the resources expended investigating the claims.
While this particular incident was fabricated, it is still important for our campus community members to be observant, to report suspicious activity and crime when it happens and to take basic safety measures which can reduce their likelihood of being targeted by a criminal. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe.
Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks escort if you need one, or download the app for iOS or Android.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University's Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan guidelines protect you from legal or disciplinary consequences when you take the appropriate action to ensure others' safety.
If you choose to consume alcohol, please be responsible. Remember your ability to respond is diminished by overconsumption of alcohol.

For the short term, we have positioned ourselves to maintain operations and will continue to pay employees and vendors. Unlike agencies that are almost solely reliant on state funding, the University also receives revenue from other sources, which will be used appropriately and will help us weather this temporary interruption in state support. We also will continue to receive additional funding to meet our near-term obligations as the state pays the $114 million remaining on the University’s appropriation for the 2015 fiscal year that ended June 30. We expect those payments to continue into fiscal 2016.
Due to the uncertainty, however, consideration of a salary program for the coming year is on hold and will be revisited once a budget is approved.
For the longer term, we continue to advocate for adequate and responsible levels of future state funding that will preserve our excellence and maintain our service to our students and the state.
Our efforts in this regard have been vigorous and ongoing since the budget process began. I added to them with a message to the governor last week that highlights the University’s more than $10 billion annual impact on the state’s economy and the power it holds to produce the human capital and innovation that will lead Illinois forward.
I am confident that our message strikes a chord. Though the governor vetoed nearly all of a proposed state budget sent to him by the legislature, he did approve a funding increase for K-12 education. Public universities are part and parcel of the same purpose – to develop the highly skilled workforce that is critical for success in the 21st century.
In the meantime, we continue to examine our operations from top to bottom so that we are prepared to respond to the level of funding that is ultimately approved by the state.
I trust that the budget stalemate will be resolved to provide a much-needed sense of stability. Let us focus, though, on the job at hand, as we prepare to kick off the fall semester next month and welcome what we anticipate will be the largest-ever student enrollment on our three great campuses!
Thank you again for your commitment to the University of Illinois. Please enjoy your Independence Day weekend, and I will provide further updates as the budget process unfolds.

As you all know from previous communications and news reports, we face significant uncertainty regarding next year’s state funding for the university. Whatever the final numbers—and whenever we receive them—our collective focus must remain firmly where it has been for nearly 150 years: pushing the edges of exploration and discovery and educating the next generation of innovative and productive citizens of our state, nation, and world.
Adjusting to cuts in state funding and to broader changes in the higher education fiscal landscape is a significant challenge. But this university’s world class reputation has been built on a culture that seeks solutions to the most difficult challenges and embraces opportunities for dynamism and renewal.
In an effort to help us better align our long-term budgetary strategies with our goals and aspirations, we are convening a new Campus Budget Advisory Task Force (CBATF). Comprised of faculty, staff and students recommended by deans, the Academic Senate, and senior administrators, the CBATF will act as an advisory body as we work with the Council of Deans and through shared governance with the Senate to address the fiscal challenges we face. Specifically, we have asked the CBATF to:
Synthesize the breadth of financial and budgetary information and recommendations prepared by the colleges, academic units, faculty, staff and students across campus as well as from external stakeholders;
Review relevant reports and recommendations of standing committees and ad hoc working groups, such as the Campus Budget Oversight Committee, the Deans’ Budget Committee, and others;
Propose activities, operations and/or units for further budgetary review;
Assess the fiscal impact of proposed cost reduction strategies, revenue enhancement ideas and other strategic initiatives; and
Advise on data-driven long-term planning.
The work of the CBATF will inform our review of existing budget processes and the structure of standing campus budget committees. The aim is to ensure that we have an approach to ongoing budget review and guidance that is effective, efficient, and consistent with our shared governance principles. The primary charge of this task force is to help us create a more integrated and comprehensive set of longer-term budgetary priorities and plans that are faithful to our core mission and strategic goals. We ask the task force to emulate what we do every day in our classrooms, laboratories, and offices:  ask critical and searching questions, evaluate data thoughtfully, welcome different perspectives and creatively and consultatively help develop proposed solutions.
Professor Matthew Ando, Head of the Mathematics Department, has graciously agreed to serve as Chair of the CBATF. We have asked the members of the CBATF to begin work this summer. A CBATF web site with the formal charge, task force membership and an online form to solicit advice from the entire campus community can be found here: http://budgettaskforce.illinois.edu.

I write to address the June 13 vote by the American Association of University Professors to censure the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign administration. The censure is focused on the hiring decisions and processes involving Professor Salaita, as well as AAUP concerns about the application of a civility standard as a restriction on academic freedom. The full text of the resolution can be found on the AAUP web site. 
This decision, while disappointing, was not unexpected. The AAUP committee that formulated the resolution had announced several weeks ago that it would be putting the resolution forward for this vote.
We take this decision by the AAUP seriously.  We understand that it will have repercussions on the scholarly activities of many in our community, and we intend to address both the censure and the underlying concerns through our established processes of shared governance.
In the past year, we have taken several steps to move our campus forward and reaffirm our commitment to principles of academic freedom and shared governance. We have engaged in repeated and substantive attempts to reach a settlement with Professor Salaita. And throughout this time, we have also been in regular communication with the leadership of the national and local AAUP regarding these steps. We will continue that active engagement with them to determine avenues and actions to clear this censure as quickly as possible, and to minimize its impact on our educational and scholarly missions. 
As I have said many times, my August 2014 massmail was not intended to establish a policy on speech or a campus speech code. I believe any such code would be an unacceptable restriction on the academic freedom of our faculty. It was not my intention to make our campus a focal point for the complicated, nuanced and ongoing national debate on the nature of civility and higher education, and I sincerely regret that my message did so.
As we move forward, I am committed to working with everyone on this campus to continue to support the outstanding level of scholarship, teaching and engagement that our state, nation and world expect of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Sincerely,
Phyllis M. WiseChancellor"

Dear colleagues,
As the impasse over the state’s fiscal 2016 budget continues in Springfield, I want to update you on the University’s activities and address concerns expressed about news coming out of the Capitol.
The University, through my office and the Office of Governmental Relations, continues to advocate strongly for adequate and responsible levels of state support for the University of Illinois. We convened the presidents of the public universities and made advocacy visits to top legislative leaders and senior executive staff in the governor’s office. I met personally with the governor during the spring session. We provided testimony in budget hearings and to legislative budget working groups. We have generated “calls to action” to alumni, faculty, staff and students. We established a U of I legislative caucus that meets in the Capitol. And we are meeting regularly with community leadership groups around the state to articulate the central value proposition for public higher education as the engine for economic revitalization for Illinois.  
We continue to monitor the situation at the Statehouse closely and to provide information and assistance to the governor and lawmakers as needed and upon request. The U of I will participate in a special Senate hearing on college affordability next week.
The information coming out of Springfield at times like this can be confusing. Earlier this week, it was reported that the state might stop making payments on July 1, the start of fiscal 2016, if a new budget is not approved by June 30, and that state workers might begin missing paychecks on July 15. I want to assure you that the University of Illinois is planning to continue to pay its employees and vendors throughout this budget cycle, thanks to prudent fiscal stewardship.
We expect continued funding to meet the University’s obligations as the state pays the remainder of the University’s current fiscal 2015 appropriation. A prolonged budget impasse would be troubling and we are confident that the governor and legislative leaders will reach an agreement soon to fund operations of the state in the new fiscal year.
I want to thank all of you for your continued dedication to our University. I will provide further updates as needed.
Sincerely,
Tim Killeen
President"

As you may have seen in the media, the legislative session in Springfield reached its deadline Sunday without an agreement on a state budget for fiscal 2016, which begins July 1. The expectation is that lawmakers and Gov. Bruce Rauner will return to the Capitol as soon as this week to resume negotiations on the budget and other unresolved issues.
This development was not unexpected, and it’s not the first time a spring legislative session has gone into summer “overtime.”
I will be working with our governmental relations and budgeting staff in the coming weeks to continue to make the case for adequate, responsible state support of the University of Illinois, and for all of public higher education in Illinois. As recently as last week I convened a group of leaders from the state’s public universities to meet with legislative leaders and Gov. Rauner’s chief of staff to reiterate our collective value to the state as well as our nation. I am confident our message was heard, and we will continue the work to advance higher education as among the state’s priorities.

I want to thank all of you who joined us last week – in person or virtually – at the Town Hall and reception to welcome President Killeen on his first official day as president of the University of Illinois. From the talks by Tim Killeen, Chancellors Susan Koch, Michael Amiridis and myself to the student speakers, the performance by members of the Black Chorus and the conversation moderated by Dean Ed Feser – the event was a spirited beginning to a weeklong, statewide tour that included all three of our campuses and the medical campuses in Rockford and Peoria.
This was a wonderful opportunity for me to join President Killeen, and my fellow chancellors for this week of conversations with alumni, friends, stakeholders, editorial boards of major newspapers and television and radio outlets throughout the state. I learned a great deal about how much leaders and the citizens of Illinois care about us and how much they look to us for solutions to many of the grand societal challenges facing us. It was very clear just how broad, deep and critical our impact is. We are a massive driver of educational, social and economic development for the state. Together we are the largest provider of undergraduate education to our residents. We are major sources of direct and indirect employment and our research enterprise is a huge source of new federal and private investment in Illinois each year.
I was particularly proud to be the chancellor of the flagship campus in the University of Illinois system. Our campus alone accounts for approximately $6.5 billion of direct economic impact and touches the lives of millions of people across every single county. Together, we have brought more than $500M in federal grants and contracts to Illinois, and over the past five years, our researchers have filed almost 1,000 invention disclosures.
Our students come to Illinois to get a world-class education and become leaders in their communities, our state and the world. Be sure to read the brief summary of that impact by the numbers here.
While we face significant challenges, our campus remains one of the nation’s pre-eminent public research universities. We have tremendous opportunities and many reasons to be optimistic about the future of the University of Illinois. It is my pleasure to welcome Tim Killeen as our twentieth president.
Sincerely,
Phyllis M. WiseChancellor"

Dear colleagues and friends:
The University of Illinois is a very special place for a host of reasons, but largely due to the excellence and commitment of its people—students, faculty and staff, alumni and friends. That central truth was reinforced for me last week, my first official week on the job, when I had the opportunity and pleasure to meet and talk with so many of you.
I saw first-hand your creativity and incisiveness of thought, your enthusiastic spirit, and your deep commitment to service. These were just a few of the many qualities that stood out to me as the three chancellors and I traveled to Urbana-Champaign, Chicago, Springfield, Rockford and Peoria to meet the U of I family and host town hall conversations about our collective future. Along the way, we met with students, faculty, staff, alumni, local mayors, the media, community and business leaders.
Please accept my thanks to those who participated, followed on video-stream, and helped to plan and execute the week’s exciting 450-mile journey to five campuses. The experience reminded me why I’m so optimistic about the University’s future.
As I mentioned at all stops—and there are more visits in the works—this is just the start of a deep engagement that I believe will provide profound insights and will serve to develop new connections and collaborations across our University.
The conversation hasn’t ended, however, so please feel free to provide your thoughts, suggestions and comments using an online form. There will be many opportunities for further discussion when we kick off a University strategic planning process in June that will wrap up next March.
On Tuesday, I returned to the Capitol in Springfield to convene a meeting with presidents and board chairs from all the other public universities in Illinois to unite our voices in advocating for a robust level of state funding for public higher education and to restate our mutual commitment to responsible public service. Investing in public universities is an investment in solutions—and in the future of our state.
Thank you for your welcome to me as your new president and thank you—most sincerely—for all you do every day to foster the great mission of the University of Illinois.
Timothy L. Killeen President"

Dear colleagues and friends:
As I begin my first official day as president, I want you to know how profoundly honored and delighted I am to be joining you. I said on the day my appointment was announced last November that I was in awe of the University – I can honestly say today that the feeling of awe has only grown over the past six months.
The University of Illinois is a very special place, with wonderful students, fabulous faculty and staff, and three magnificent campuses that are respected across the state of Illinois and around the world as leaders and pioneers in teaching, learning, scholarship and discovery. There is an amazing legacy of success and contributions in all disciplines over nearly 150 years. There is also a critically important and vibrant commitment to shared governance and institutional advancement on the part of the faculty. So, I view the presidency as a sacred trust and I can promise you my very best efforts on behalf of the University and its many stakeholders.
I’m deeply grateful to President Emeritus Bob Easter for sharing his time and insights so generously during our transition. His many talents and contributions in positions from student to president have helped drive the university’s continued rise over the last four decades. I wish Bob and his wife Cheryl all the very best in retirement – but have also warned them that I still have their number!
I’m eager to get down to business, working with all of you to build on our legacy and make the University of Illinois the gold standard for higher education in the 21st century – with best-in-class academic and research programs that serve our students and the public good.
We have all of the tools. An experienced and dedicated leadership team. World-class faculty and staff. Great students. State-of-the-art facilities. Loyal alumni. Generous donors. And, together, they share a passion to be the very best.
As we push toward our common goal, we’ll face bumps, including budgetary business to attend to in Springfield. In March, the Board of Trustees directed me to develop a university-wide strategic plan that will become our roadmap to the future. The planning process will be inclusive – a collaboration with all of you, with our campuses and with our many stakeholders to forge a collective and shared vision that will guide us to an even better tomorrow.
Soon, I’ll be scheduling a series of meetings to collect your thoughts and ideas. In the meantime, I’m anxious to get to know all of you, so I’m hosting town hall-style events on each of our campuses this week to introduce myself and the leadership team of campus chancellors. Dates, times and locations are available here.
My wife Roberta and I are proud and honored to call the University of Illinois home. We look forward to meeting you, and to thank you in person for your commitment and loyalty to this great university.
Timothy L. Killeen

The Cozad New Venture competition for student entrepreneurs
The 17th annual Roger Ebert Film Festival

This work will be collaborative, and there will be multiple opportunities to share your ideas and suggestions, including interviews, on-campus focus groups, and online surveys. I hope you will engage with this process, as it is critical that we hear from the voices of the people who know the University best – students, faculty, staff, and alumni.
When I first came to campus, we launched the Visioning Future Excellence Initiative to align our aspirations as a University and to give broad structure to our research, teaching, and public engagement efforts. This marketing project is the next step in that process. As we look to the future and consider the pressures we face to fulfill our land-grant mission, we must amplify our voices and ensure that the unique value of the University is understood, appreciated, and supported.
Sincerely,
Phyllis M. WiseChancellor"

Dear colleagues,
Today, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously struck down a pension law that would have scaled back employee benefits, ruling that it violates a provision in the 1970 state constitution that says benefits shall not be diminished or impaired. A link to a Chicago Tribune story is here.
Now that the Supreme Court has spoken on the law’s constitutionality, we await the state’s reaction to the ruling. Although the ruling leaves the pension issue unresolved, it is an important next step and may provide guidance as elected officials consider other alternatives.
Adequate funding of Illinois’ public pensions is of great concern to University of Illinois employees and annuitants. Pensions are a key element in a competitive compensation program that is critical in recruiting and retaining faculty and staff.
The U of I will continue to track this important issue and provide its input and expertise to those who must chart a new path to a sustainable pension system.
Sincerely,
Robert A. Easter
President"

Your participation will help ensure that we have an accurate representation of the data in use on campus and where it resides.What you need to do:Go to: http://go.illinois.edu/dc_survey and complete the survey by May 15, 2015. The survey should take 5-10 minutes to complete. You only need to note whether you use any information in a particular category, and generally where you store information that you work with. You do not need to classify all of the pieces of data you work with.Why we are doing this:The university is responsible for a wealth of information stored in many different locations. This information is one of the university’s greatest assets, but it can also be a liability if it is not protected  appropriately.Knowing what information we have and where it resides is the first step to make sure the university is a good steward of its digital assets. Unfortunately, there is currently no comprehensive catalog of the pieces of information in use on campus or where they are stored.Some pieces of information requires higher levels of protection, either because of state or federal laws, industry regulations, or contractual agreements. We are particularly interested in where and how this information is stored on campus. Knowing this will help us determine if the storage locations and business processes for these are secure and follow best practices.Technical details:This survey is not anonymous.

Dear colleagues:
As I look ahead to retirement on May 17 after more than four decades with the University of Illinois, I’m reminded of a quote by A.A. Milne, best known for his Winnie the Pooh book series:
“How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.”
I could never have imagined the experiences ahead when Cheryl and I rolled our U Haul into Champaign-Urbana to begin my graduate studies back in 1973. This great University has been our home ever since, and I still marvel that I was given the opportunity to see it from nearly every angle – as a student, alumnus, donor, faculty member, department head, dean, interim provost and chancellor and, for the last three years, as president.
Over those years, the University’s growth has been remarkable – in enrollment, in facilities, in service to our students and our state, in research discovery, and in global prestige. It has risen to a place among the world’s best thanks to all of you – our students and alumni, faculty and staff, administrators and trustees, donors and friends – and it is our relationships with all of you that Cheryl and I will cherish most.
The University is currently at a crossroads. Government funding declines, online education and growing global competition have combined to threaten access, affordability and the excellence that is synonymous with the University of Illinois. 
But I’m confident that our future is bright. I have had the opportunity to work closely with President-designate Tim Killeen and he has the right kind of experiences to elevate our educational and research missions, a personality and collaborative style that fits the needs of the role, and a deep commitment to serving our students, our state and our nation.
He also has all of you. Your hard work, scholarship, integrity and passion lifted the University to where it is today and will help lead it to a new era of service that matches the legacy of its past.
Thank you for your support, your kindness and your dedication and loyalty to the University of Illinois.

As you know, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has prohibited smoking on campus property since January 1, 2014. Our smoke-free campus policy has contributed to making our campus a healthy place to learn, live and work and has set an example for other colleges and universities in Illinois and beyond.
The State of Illinois’ Smoke-Free Campus Act requires that all state-supported institutions of higher education prohibit smoking on campus as of July 1, 2015.
The act requires that each institution communicate to the campus community and guests the prohibitions on smoking set forth in the act. You can read more about the Smoke-Free Campus Act at: http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=098-0985.

After consulting with various stakeholders across campus, we chose Technology Services to bring clarity to our role at the University. Students and faculty, particularly those who are new to campus, often found the acronym “CITES” to be difficult to understand. As CITES, one of the most common questions that we received was “What do you do?”
Removing that immediate point of confusion is a crucial first step in transforming Technology Services into an organization focused on meeting the changing technology needs of students and faculty.
Sunsetting “CITES” across campus will take place over the summer.
The ways to contact our Help Desk will not change. You can still call 217-244-7000 or email consult@illinois.edu for assistance. We will launch a new Technology Services website over the summer as well.
I invite you to bring your thoughts and feedback about technology on campus to one of our two Technology Services Town Hall meetings. These events are a chance for you to learn more about the direction and vision of Technology Services at Illinois and have your questions answered.
Monday, May 4 in the Illini Union (Room C) from 3:00 - 4:00 pm
Wednesday, May 6 in the Animal Sciences Lab (Room 150) from 1:00 pm - 2:00 pm
If you are unable to attend one of these Town Hall meetings, I invite you to share your thoughts and feedback via email by sending a message to techservices@illinois.edu

2015-04-27T08:03:00Z,2015-04-27,8:3,30930,Student Absence Letter Policy Changes,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/27423.html,"Dear Student,
I am writing to inform you that The Student Assistance Center in the Office of the Dean of Students has revised our absence letter policy and the changes will take effect in summer 2015. The purpose of this communication is to alert you to the changes so that you will understand the conditions under which you will be eligible to be considered for an absence letter from our office.  
Absence letters from the Office of the Dean of Students do not excuse students from class; this authority rests with the instructor of the course. Our letters are intended to provide information to your instructors about absences which are due to a lengthy illness and certain emergency circumstances which they may use in their decision-making about excusing the absence and permitting make up work.
Key changes to the new policy are outlined here:
Effective summer 2015 
◊ Absence letter requests must be made once the student has resumed classes but no later than 10 business days after the last date of absence
◊ Brief, intermittent illness-related absences are no longer eligible for absence letters. Only requests for protracted illness of three days or more will be considered  
◊ Students may seek absence letters to be present during the serious illness of immediate family members only
◊ University policy and state law require that all instructors reasonably accommodate conflicts and work requirements resulting from a student’s religious beliefs, observance and practices. Students are required to submit the Request for Accommodation for Religious Observances Form to their professors and the Office of the Dean of Students to request accommodation by the end of the second week of the course
◊ Guidelines have been developed to provide students time to attend the bereavement services of family members. Students will experience other types of loss including the loss of personal and family friends, godparents, pets, etc…that are not addressed by these guidelines. Although these absences will not be eligible for an absence letter from the Office of the Dean of Students, students may discuss with their professors whether such absences will be excused; and students may need to make individual choices about taking time away that is consistent with their emotional needs.
◊ The Office of the Dean of Students has more clearly defined “serious and compelling circumstances beyond a student’s control” such that students and professors more clearly understand which circumstances meet this criteria and which do not. For example, students are not eligible for absence letters for job or graduate school interviews, family events such as reunions or weddings, or to be present with extended family members during illness.
To review this document online and those referenced therein, please go to: http://www.odos.uiuc.edu/ To view the new policy its entirety, as it will appear in Section 1-501 of the revised Student Code of Conduct. (http://odos.illinois.edu/studentAssistance/absence/revised_code.asp)
I hope this information will be helpful to you as you prepare for your summer semester and any subsequent semesters that you are enrolled at the University of Illinois.

This year the Illinois Student Senate has collaborated with the White House, the Women’s Resource Center, the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and several student groups to implement the It’s On Us campaign at Illinois. Students across the country have taken the pledge to intervene in situations where consent has not or cannot be given and work together at creating an environment in which sexual assault is unacceptable and survivors are supported.
Throughout the year we have held events on sexual assault, released public service announcements, hosted a Twitter town hall and had more students than almost any other university in the country to sign the It’s On Us pledge. We have been a model of campus sexual assault prevention and engagement for the entire nation.
But we’re not finished. Sexual assault is still a major problem on college campuses and we cannot let our momentum fade with the end of the school year. We must stay strong in our belief that It’s On Us to stop sexual assault. We must do everything we can to stop a sexual assault from happening.
In celebration of our work, to further this message and continue empowering our generation to stop sexual assault, I am proud to announce that the Vice President Joe Biden will join us next Thursday, April 23 for an It’s On Us rally. 
Upon the Vice President’s arrival, we will be hosting a renewed pledge drive and will distribute more It’s On Us t-shirts. Check out the Illinois Student Senate Facebook page for more information.

We are currently experiencing issues with wireless network connectivity throughout various campus buildings. You may be experiencing intermittent issues or may not be able to connect to wireless at all. We are aware of this problem and are actively working to resolve it.
This morning, a piece of hardware that helps provide wireless network connectivity to several buildings on campus started experiencing technical problems. As a temporary solution, we utilized a redundant backup device that should have held until we could work with our vendor to implement a permanent resolution. However, the temporary solution is not working as planned, resulting in the loss of IllinoisNet across several campus spaces.
We are currently working closely with our vendor to resolve this issue, and we will be sure to update the campus community on the status of this issue. Please check status.cites.illinois.edu to access these updates.
Please accept our apologies for this inconvenience.

2015-03-12T13:57:00Z,2015-03-12,13:57,61592,Crime Alert,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/27383.html,"Dear campus community member:
We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This information is being released in accordance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. The Clery Act requires colleges and universities to disclose information about crime on and near their campuses, including timely warnings of crimes that may represent a threat to the safety of students or employees.
The purpose of this message is to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions to help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes. This alert is being distributed with limited information so as not to release any type of identifying information about the victim.
Incident: 
The Champaign Police Department has informed the University of Illinois Police Department that a sexual assault occurred about 12:35 a.m. Thursday, March 12, in the 500 block of East Green Street, Champaign. The offender, a person unknown to the victim, was described as a white male in his early twenties with blonde hair, a half-inch scar near his right eye and wearing a blue and gold shirt. He was last seen running west on Green Street.
Police are investigating this crime. Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the Champaign Police Department at 217-351-4545. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS) or by visiting www.373tips.com. Anonymous tips may also be sent via text message by texting keyword ""CCTIP"" plus the information to 274637 (CRIMES).
Statistics:
It is estimated that nationwide 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their college years. Data reveals nearly 50 percent of transgender people experience sexual violence.
Acquaintance rape is much more prevalent than stranger rape. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
Safety information:
If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another student, intervene if it’s safe to do so, or call for support.
While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. For more information about reporting rape, please visit the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN): https://rainn.org/get-information/legal-information.
Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
While you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
Additional information:
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. It is a violation of University policy to engage in sexual activities without affirmative consent from your partner. Someone incapacitated due to alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity. This is reflected in Student Code of Conduct, Article 1, Part 3, Section 1-302(b): http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1_part3_1-302.html and in University policy: http://www.cam.illinois.edu/ix/ix-b/ix-b-3.htm.

I write to share the exciting news that the University of Illinois Board of Trustees voted unanimously today to establish the nation’s first college of medicine focused, from the beginning, on the intersection of engineering and medicine. This will be the first new college created on our campus in 60 years.
It will be a partnership between the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Carle Health System, and it is specifically designed to train a new kind of doctor and drive technology-based innovations in health care. This ground-breaking approach will integrate the university’s unparalleled assets in engineering, technology and supercomputing with Carle’s nationally recognized, comprehensive health care system. While infusing engineering with medicine is a distinctive facet of the proposed college, this new school also will tremendously benefit from leveraging expertise and knowledge from across the campus.
The professionals we educate will advance health care far beyond what we can currently comprehend. Not only will their patients benefit, but the impact they make will extend to countless others who will be healthier as a result of their medical discoveries.
The College of Medicine grew from recommendations in a 2014 economic development study conducted by the Research Park. Since that time, faculty and staff members from across campus have been working with Carle physicians and staff to develop business, governance and financing plans. I want to thank all of the faculty leaders, the Academic Senate and all campus deans who have been involved in the evaluation process. In addition, many community, state and national leaders have contributed critical thoughts that have been essential to establishing this truly unique college of medicine. Your advice and criticism have made our plan stronger, more strategic and a greater opportunity for broad collaboration with every academic unit across campus, with UIC and with other collaborators.
The college will be funded through a combination of revenue from new inventions, medical student tuition, corporate investments and private philanthropy.
The next steps toward making our shared vision a reality include seeking approval by the Illinois Board of Higher Education, recruiting a founding dean, securing financial support from donors and investors, and submitting material to seek accreditation from the Liaison Committee for Medical Education. As our vision continues to mature, I look forward to continued discussions on how the new college can truly reflect the breadth of excellence that is Illinois.

Phyllis M. WiseChancellor"

2015-03-03T05:08:00Z,2015-03-03,5:8,43001,Unofficial St. Patrick's Day,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/27369.html,"Dear Student, We are writing about the up-coming Unofficial St. Patrick's day, to encourage you to be safe, responsible and respectful in your choices related to this event. Students have often asked that they be informed of the consequences of inappropriate or illegal behavior, and that is the spirit behind this letter. At Illinois, we expect our students to take responsibility for their behavior and its impact on others.  Unfortunately, in past years, the event has led to serious injuries and at least two deaths. We want to make it clear that the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign does not sponsor or sanction Unofficial St. Patrick's Day nor any events or merchandise associated with it. On that day, as on other days, the University responds to all violations of the Student Code, regardless of where the behavior occurs. Such violations include consuming alcohol as a minor, providing alcohol to minors, damage and destruction of property, dangerous activities such as throwing items from balconies, and acts of physical violence and sexual aggression. The consequences for such violations will be assigned commensurate with the seriousness of the behavior. As a reminder, disciplinary records are subject to review in background checks by graduate schools and future employers. Students may be dismissed as a result of their dangerous behavior and irresponsible choices on Unofficial Saint Patrick's Day.   At Illinois, students who host guests are accountable for negative consequences incurred by those guests, including property damage or threats to others' safety. If a guest or visitor is cited or arrested for illegal activity, we will forward this information for disciplinary action to any college or university where that guest may be enrolled. Last year an amendment was enacted to the law which holds individuals (social hosts) criminally responsible for hosting an event or social gathering (party) where he or she knowingly authorizes or permits a residence which he or she occupies to be used for underage possession or consumption of alcohol. Violation of the law can lead to being charged with a Class A misdemeanor (which carries up to 364 days in jail and a $2,500 fine) or a Class 4 Felony (which carries up to 3 years in jail and a $25,000 fine). Hosts found serving or allowing minors to possess alcohol or charging admission will be arrested on state charges and transported to the Champaign County Jail.  
Please remember that your behavior during this event will reflect on you and on your university for years to come. For example, is a social media posting of you wearing an offensive shirt drinking alcohol the image you want to project to future employers, to your family or to the world?
 Given the serious consequences that could occur, we strongly urge you to choose responsible behavior and ask that you look out for the safety of yourselves and others, particularly in this cold winter weather we’re experiencing. Please be careful. Please be safe.  Sincerely, C. Renée Romano         Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Kenneth T. Ballom Dean of Students"

DATE:          Thursday, February 26, 2015
SUBJECT:   “Unofficial St. Patrick's Day” Friday, March 6 On Friday, March 6, 2015, many students and visitors will participate in an event known as Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. While the University does not support or condone this event, steps are being taken to ensure safety and to minimize disruption to classes and campus operations. The Champaign, Urbana, and University of Illinois police departments, assisted by other local and state agencies, will patrol the campus district on March 6. They will enforce all applicable ordinances in commercial and residential areas, and have authority to intervene if private parties threaten to disturb the peace. In addition, Champaign and Urbana officials will enact restrictions on liquor sales intended to curb overconsumption. Emergency medical personnel will be available to provide care. University police will continue to focus on protecting students, staff, faculty, and University property. Should you need to report an incident, call METCAD at 911 for emergencies, 333-8911 for non-emergencies.
As in years past, we have made clear to students that academic business will continue as usual on Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. That has helped to minimize disruptions. Instructors should not need to alter instructional plans. The Student Code http://www.admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/ addresses student responsibilities on campus. Sections 1-102(d) and 1-302(f) concern classroom conduct expectations, and section 1-307 focuses on alcohol consumption. The Code empowers instructors to ask disruptive students to leave class; after class, names of disruptive students should be reported to the Office of Student Conflict Resolution at 333-3680.  If asking a disruptive student to leave class could escalate into a confrontation, you may seek assistance. From 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on March 6, teams of Student Affairs and Academic Affairs professionals will walk through and around buildings with classrooms and lecture halls where disruptions were experienced in the past. Team members, wearing University IDs, may be summoned to help. Teams will be prepared to document apparent Code violations and to call University police, if necessary. Students will be asked not to bring any liquids into Foellinger Auditorium and Lincoln Hall Theatre. Longstanding policy prohibits liquids and food in these spaces. Students who interfere with the academic mission of the University will face serious consequences. Thank you for reinforcing this message before and on March 6."

2015-02-26T10:18:00Z,2015-02-26,10:18,17571,Moving Forward Together,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/27364.html,"Dear Colleagues:
In my time as your chancellor, I have come to understand that one of the most important qualities I can bring to the campus community is to be an active and careful listener. Over the past months, I have had many frank, open and productive discussions with faculty, staff and students across the entire campus around our hiring policies, better faculty communication, academic freedom and freedom of expression. Your concerns have been clear and they have led to actions.
A joint Academic Senate-Provost faculty committee has reviewed the current faculty hiring and appointment processes and submitted recommendations to improve them. One of these already being implemented will facilitate final faculty appointment approval by the Board of Trustees much sooner and well in advance of the arrival of potential new hires. This full report is scheduled for presentation to the Academic Senate at the March 9 meeting. 
To ensure that there is strong, consistent and open communication between our academic units and my own office, I will soon ask for nominations for new Chancellor’s Faculty Fellows in both the Humanities and in the Arts. Modeled after similar positions in the Provost’s Office, these fellows will facilitate frequent and rapid faculty guidance around critical campus issues. These will offer one more avenue to enhance the shared governance system that guides our campus.
I have met with the Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure (CAFT) to discuss its report and recommendations regarding Steven Salaita. After broad consultation across campus and in light of the Board’s clear statement that it will not reconsider its decision regarding Dr. Salaita, I have decided not to remand the decision to the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences for further consideration. While the employment decision is now in front of a federal court, I want to reiterate that we have undertaken significant and meaningful efforts to engage Dr. Salaita and his representatives in attempts to resolve this issue. 
I also wish to clarify the intent of my Aug. 22 massmail, which has generated so much debate around issues of academic freedom and expression in regards to civility. I want to make absolutely clear that my statement was not intended to establish a policy on speech or a campus speech code. I believe any such code would represent an unacceptable restriction on the academic freedom of our faculty. This is consistent with the principles described in the American Association of University Professors’ (AAUP’s) 1994 Statement “On Freedom of Expression and Campus Speech Codes.” These are foundational issues to American higher education and bedrock principles of our own university. It was not my intention in my message to make our campus a focal point for the complicated, nuanced and ongoing national debate on the nature of civility and higher education. Instead, I was using the term within my understanding of it in the context of the 1940 and 1994 AAUP statements. The purpose of my August message was to enunciate my aspirations for Illinois to be a community where respectful discourse is championed and where together, we recognize that intolerance may impede the educational experiences of our students. These are aspirations that can only be achieved by inspiring new ideas and new avenues of exploration.
I have valued the honest and open conversations I have had with many of you across campus over the past months. I offer my thanks to all who have taken the time to voice their opinions. These are exactly the kind of free discussions that we must have to bring us together and help us move forward to face the short-term challenges ahead and to seize the long-term opportunities that are opening up before us.
Sincerely,
Phyllis M. WiseChancellor"

There are some important announcements and opportunities I want to share with you.
Important Step to Keep MTD Buses Running
One of the best ways to stay warm in this frigid weather is taking the Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District (MTD) buses around campus. The current university contract with MTD will expire this summer and we need to renew the transportation fee to sustain the current level of service. Further, we have proposed a fee increase to improve service for central campus, FAR/PAR and VetMed. Please sign this petition to put these two items on the student elections ballot and keep buses running next year.
Teaching Excellence Awards
We need your help identifying exceptional professors and teaching assistants. Each year, the Illinois Student Senate hosts the Teaching Excellence Awards (TEA), a highly regarded award presented to premier instructors who are assets to our education and campus experiences. Please take a few minutes to appreciate your favorite professors and TAs by nominating them here.
Campus Committees
Is there a part of student life you want to improve? Join a campus committee. They bring student voice to every campus entity. From cultural center advisory committees to the Parking Appeals Board, and from the Krannert Center Advisory Committee to the State Farm Center Advisory Committee, there’s something for everyone. This is a great and manageable way to engage in campus decision-making and make every part of campus better! Apply here 
I wish you all the best with the rest of this semester.

On Wednesday, Governor Rauner proposed a 2016 budget intended to address the very serious financial situation facing our entire state. It recommends significant spending reductions across many state programs including appropriations to higher education.
I want to reiterate President Easter’s message that this is the first step in the legislative budget process. Provost Adesida, the campus administrative team and I are working closely with President Easter, President-designate Killeen and the University Administration to ensure that the governor and the General Assembly recognize the role our programs play in driving the economic and social advances of the state. In the past weeks, the governor has made it clear that this campus is one of the most valuable assets to our state and we are optimistic that this confidence will be reflected when a final budget is passed later this spring.
We must be guided by our vision statement: “We will be the pre-eminent public research university with a land-grant mission and global impact.” Our strategic plan sets forth a goal of stewarding current resources and generating new investment. We are committed to our plan and to identifying strategies that will enable us to remain competitive with our national peers. Clearly with the current economic conditions and the financial challenges facing our state, we must work even harder to move forward strategically and efficiently in a climate where state appropriations are tight. This is an opportunity for us to collectively reexamine and reevaluate our priorities, from the department and unit level up through our central campus administrative and service structures. We must be even more diligent and creative in ways to reduce our administrative overhead and streamline our processes and practices. We must look for new ways to generate revenue and savings that can mitigate potential cuts and be reinvested in our campus. We will also depend heavily on shared governance through the Academic Senate and faculty leadership across the institution to ensure that decisions we make together are for the greater good of the entire campus community. 
I want to thank all of the faculty, staff and students here at Illinois. The value of this university to our state and the contributions it makes in our world come from your hard work, your new ideas and your unyielding belief in the power of education.
I will share information about our budget future as we learn it.
Sincerely,
Phyllis M. WiseChancellor"

In his inaugural budget address today, Gov. Bruce Rauner recommended a 31.5 percent fiscal 2016 budget reduction for higher education – a proposal that, if enacted, would cut general revenue funding (GRF) for the University of Illinois by nearly $209 million.
It is important to note that this is the first step in the legislative budget process and we will work with the governor and members of the General Assembly to make what we believe is a strong case to support the University programs that help lift our state.
Our overarching goals are to sustain our academic quality and the value of University degrees; retain the faculty and staff who are the core of our excellence and our ability to recruit the world’s best; preserve our ability to conduct pioneering research that fosters innovation, economic growth and serves the needs of the citizens of our state and nation; and continue delivering critical services such as health care. A reduction in the appropriation at the magnitude proposed will certainly impact our core missions.
At the same time, reality dictates that we immediately begin preparing for the impact if the legislature ultimately approves a large-scale reduction in funding. We will work with our Board of Trustees, campus leadership, and our faculty and staff to look deeply at all that we do and make the difficult programmatic and organizational decisions that would be required.
The University stewards its financial resources carefully and has weathered past funding reductions with its quality intact. But we do not have the resources to overcome reductions of this magnitude without harm.
The University of Illinois is an investment that transforms the lives of students and drives progress for our state, and we will continue to vigorously advocate for its interests as the budget process unfolds.
My thanks to all of you for what you do each and every day to support this great university. And I will keep you posted throughout this eventful legislative session as developments occur.
 
Robert A. Easter

The University of Illinois Police Department issues Crime Alerts in accordance with the federal Jeanne Clery Act, which requires colleges and universities across the United States to disclose information about crime on and around their campuses. This notice aims to heighten your awareness of public safety issues in the area.
The University of Illinois Police Department committed to working with the campus community in identifying and arresting offenders, and is releasing this information to aid in the community’s protection.
INCIDENT:     Aggravated Assault/Possible Robbery

The Champaign Police Department has informed the University of Illinois Police Department of an aggravated assault and possible robbery that occurred around 12 a.m. Wednesday. According to the report, a student was walking near the intersection of Fifth and Daniel streets, Champaign, when he encountered two men who asked him where he was going. When the student answered, one of the two men hit him in the mouth. The victim momentarily lost consciousness and sustained minor injuries. He later discovered his cellphone was missing.
OFFENDER DESCRIPTIONS:
The offenders are described as males in their early twenties.
POLICE RESPONSE:
The Champaign Police Department is working to identify and apprehend the offenders and is asking the campus community to assist. Witnesses to this event or those with information are encouraged to contact the Champaign Police Department at 351-4545. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Crime Stoppers at 373-TIPS (8477), or by visiting www.373tips.com.

Yesterday, we told you of the tragic death of your fellow student, Vicente Mundo. Many in the U. of I. community have come together to mourn this loss.
Today, we can report to you that police have arrested two men who will be charged with homicide: Daniel Gonzalez, 21, of Cicero, and Reginald Scott, 21, of Champaign. Neither is a current U. of I. student.
The U. of I. Police, Champaign County’s Sheriff’s Office, Champaign Police, Champaign County Coroner, Champaign County State’s Attorney, FBI, and U.S. Marshals Service all worked together in making this arrest. But most importantly, the campus as a whole came together to support each other and ensure that the U. of I. community remains strong through this ordeal.
We know there’s still a long road ahead. The prosecution of these two men will occur over the coming months, and the pain felt by Vicente’s family and friends will never cease. But we hope this news brings some comfort and assurance that these two men are not a danger to others.
Sincerely,

We write unfortunately to inform you of a campus tragedy, the death of Vicente Mundo, an undergraduate student from Chicago studying Statistics. All of us are deeply saddened by this news, and our thoughts are with his family and friends. We are reaching out to make sure they have the support they need following this unimaginable loss.
Initial indications are that Mr. Mundo’s death was not an accident. We want to share with you the facts as we know them and remind you of the resources available to you on campus. We do not believe this to be a random act.
You may have heard or seen information recently about Mr. Mundo, who was reported missing last week. Many people in our campus community worked together to do everything they could to help find him, and are distraught to know that Mr. Mundo was found deceased several miles south of campus.
Though we believe that another person is responsible for his death, we want to assure you that we do not believe this presents an ongoing threat to our campus community. Investigators from U. of I. Police, Champaign Police, the Champaign County Sheriff’s Office, the Champaign County Coroner, the Champaign County State’s Attorney and the FBI are working together to find the responsible party. We plan to keep our campus informed of developments.
The community can assist in the investigation by clicking here to visit the U. of I. Police website.
At the U. of I. Police Department, we are deeply troubled any time harm comes to one of our students. We have a responsibility to Mr. Mundo’s family, his friends and our campus community to bring whoever is responsible to justice, and we will never give up on that promise until that happens.
We are a campus community, and now is a time to come together. In the coming days, we hope students will find support in one another, their families and mentors, but we also want to remind students of the counseling services on campus. The website of the Counseling Center with hours, location and services available is http://counselingcenter.illinois.edu/.
U. of I. Police has a full complement of officers patrolling campus, and we are going to be as visible as we can in the coming weeks. We always have police officers from the Champaign and Urbana police departments supplementing our force. We will be here for you when you need us. That has always been true, and it certainly is not going to change now.

Jeffrey T. Christensen

Dear Colleagues:
Since being sworn into office Jan. 12, Gov. Bruce Rauner has issued a series of executive orders and some of them affect public universities and their employees. Executive Orders 15-08 and 15-09, as well as the Governor’s Office of Management and Budget (GOMB) Guidelines for Compliance with EO-08, are the three actions with perhaps the greatest significance to the University of Illinois.
The executive orders and guidelines make changes in how state entities — including public universities — must operate and be accountable. Effective until the end of fiscal 2015 (June 30), E.O. 15-08 freezes discretionary spending and requires GOMB approval of certain contracts and expenditures using state-appropriated funds. E.O. 15-09 sets higher ethics and gift-ban standards, while also providing for GOMB pre-approval of “any employment contract.”
The university intends to fully comply with the orders and has already provided GOMB with initial reports in response. Representatives of the university have been in discussions with the Governor’s Office and GOMB to ensure that compliance with the executive orders does not hinder the university’s important missions in teaching, research, public service, and economic development. Some interpretive questions remain, and we are working with the Governor’s Office and GOMB to develop additional guidance with respect to compliance and implementation.   
For now, in light of the state’s current fiscal challenges, I expect everyone to follow the intent of the executive orders as issued. Deans and department heads should refrain from filling positions that are not mission critical and be frugal with travel and other expenses, relying on common sense solutions such as videoconferencing or using fleet rather than personal vehicles.  
Again, we are still in the process of developing a full understanding of the executive orders and their impacts and will keep you apprised of further developments.       Sincerely,
Robert A. EasterPresident"

The University of Illinois Police Department is issuing this public safety advisory at the request of the Champaign Police Department, which is seeking community assistance in locating 23-year-old Cristian Zamora, who has been missing since the evening of Dec. 31, 2014. Mr. Zamora is not a student, however he resides in the Campustown area.
Please click here for more information on Mr. Zamora.
Although the Champaign Police Department continues its efforts to locate Mr. Zamora, extreme cold temperatures and inclement weather increase the risk to Mr. Zamora should he be outdoors. As a result, police are asking residents of Champaign-Urbana to search their garages and property for any evidence of Mr. Zamora or his belongings.

To:  All Faculty and Other Academics
From:  Peter Schiffer, Vice Chancellor for Research
Subject:  Annual Message on Research Integrity Policies
Integrity is at the core of all of our research activities, and this e-mail is the annual reminder of University policies regarding our research integrity obligations and responsibilities. Almost every sponsor of research activity requires that all faculty, staff, and students engaged in sponsored research be informed regularly about campus policies on research integrity, so please share this message with all members of your research teams – including both staff and students.
The University-wide procedures for addressing particular instances of unethical conduct in research and publication are available on the Web at:
           http://www.vpaa.uillinois.edu/Policies/integrityresearch/index.cfm  
Under this Policy, all members of the University community are expected to observe high standards of academic integrity and ethical behavior in research and publication. Any practice or conduct by a member of the University community that seriously deviates from those ethical standards for proposing, conducting, and publishing research that are commonly accepted within the professional community constitutes academic misconduct in violation of University Policy.
Research misconduct includes, but is not limited to, fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results:
- Fabrication is making up data or results and recording or reporting them.
- Falsification is manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record.
- Plagiarism is the appropriation of another person’s ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit.
Other examples of research misconduct include:
- Intentionally misleading or deliberately false reporting of credentials and related information;
- Abuse of confidentiality with respect to unpublished materials;
- Misappropriation of research materials;
- Evasion, or intentional failure to comply after notice with research regulations, such as those governing conflict of interest/commitment, human subjects, laboratory animals, new drugs, radioactive materials, genetically altered organisms, and safety;
- Any other conduct that constitutes a serious deviation from accepted ethical guidelines and professional standards in scholarship and research.
Note that honest errors or differences of opinion are not considered research misconduct.

Campus snow removal is a carefully coordinated, cooperative effort involving multiple F&S departments and the cities of Champaign and Urbana.  
Links to city and state snow removal information, campus web cameras to view conditions, and parking information are available on the F&S website: http://www.fs.illinois.edu/services/maintenance/snow-removal.  If you have questions about snow removal, contact the F&S Service Office, 217-333-0340.
Your patience and assistance are appreciated while crews do their best to clear snow and work as quickly as practical to expedite its removal.   
Parking:If assigned parking areas have yet to be plowed, use designated priority lots (E14, B1, F27) and Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District (MTD) service. Please do not park in unplowed lots as it further complicates and delays snow removal efforts.
Sidewalks/Pathways: Typically, an initial clearing pass is made of all 80 miles of campus sidewalk by 8:00 a.m. Variable winter weather conditions can significantly impact locations across campus, forming persistent snow/ice in some areas and impeding the ability of the F&S Grounds department to maintain sidewalk and bicycle pathways cleared from edge-to-edge. University Housing and the Division of Intercollegiate Athletics perform some snow removal at campus residence halls and athletic facilities.
Pretreatment:Prior to winter weather events, F&S Grounds and Transportation crews will apply brine to streets, parking lots, and sidewalks to assist with melting snow and ice. This de-icing solution is an economical and effective way to pretreat large areas of campus without harming the landscape.
Road Salt: Due to repeated snow and ice events last winter, regional salt supplies remain at lower-than-normal levels causing some salt prices to more than double from last year. Current university reserves are sufficient for a winter with typical snowfall. F&S will continue to evaluate all available supply options and will stay in contact with the cities of Champaign and Urbana to coordinate snow removal.
Extreme Conditions:At any time, winter weather conditions may become so unusual or unexpected that F&S staff, in consultation with campus administration, may briefly order a departure from general snow removal procedures."

I'm excited to announce that the Illinois Student Senate (ISS) has partnered with The White House to launch the It's On Us campaign here at the Univeristy of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It's On Us focuses on changing the culture around the way studnets think, talk, and act about sexual assault. The campaign calls for students to take on the collective responsiblity to prevent sexual assault in any way possible.
We have launched a Public Service Annoucnement featuring student atheletes that have already taken the It's On Us pledge to stop sexual assault.
The pledge asks studnets to take four main actions:
To recognize that non-consensual sex is sexual assault.
To idenitfy situations in which sexual assault may occur.
To intervene in situations where consent has not or cannot be given.
To create an environment in which sexual assault is unacceptable and survivors are supported.
Join me, and thousands of other students at Illinois and across the nation, in taking the pledge to stop sexual assault at ItsOnUs.org.
After you take the pledge, make sure to share it on Facebook and Twitter and then share the PSA as well. Please also use our social media toolkit or join some of the events happening this week to help spread the campaign even further.
We must realize that no one person can stop sexual assault, but we must rather act together to be more than just bystanders—everyone plays a part in stepping up and intervening to stop sexual assault. You can help make a tremendous impact in our campus community by taking the pledge and spreading the It's On Us message. 
In Orange and Blue,
Mitch DickeyStudent Body PresidentUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"

OCCURRED: October 22, 2014
LOCATION: Quad
BRIEF DETAILS:
Multiple reports of knife-wielding assailants on the University of Illinois campus this week proved to be nothing more than bad judgment by a pair of brothers from Urbana, Illinois. Responding to 911 calls from campus Wednesday night, University of Illinois police approached the two siblings, ages 31 and 26, who were decked out in full horror movie costumes and carrying fake knives. The brothers, who have no affiliation with the U. of I., conversed with students and brandished the phony knives during those encounters.  While the brothers told police they were out to “have fun,” officers explained their actions were alarming to students and were not taken lightly in consideration of the enhanced awareness surrounding campus safety. The brothers were issued trespassing notices and are subject to arrest for criminal trespass in the event they venture onto campus again."

BRIEF DETAILS: 
The Champaign Police Department is investigating a string of batteries that occurred at various locations (see above) in the campus area on Saturday, October 11, 2014.
Between 3:30 a.m. and 4:10 a.m. there were four similar incidents where individuals (5 victims) who were walking in the campus area were approached and battered for no apparent reason. Based on the circumstances, it is possible that all victims were battered by the same group of suspects. In one incident, the suspects exited two vehicles, battered the victim and left the area in the vehicles. In the other cases it appears the suspects were walking together in a group just prior to battering the victims. During some of these encounters, the suspects would ask the victim for an item or verbalize general threats just prior to the battery.  One victim had a cell phone taken. None of the victims sustained major injuries, but some did seek medical treatment for cuts and bruises.
OFFENDER DESCRIPTIONS:
In all the cases, the victims described the suspects as a group of black males. The number in the group ranged from 6 to 8. One victim stated the suspects appeared around 25 years old and were dressed in tee shirts and jeans. Another victim stated the suspects exited two vehicles prior to the battery and described the vehicles as a SUV and a passenger car.

2014-10-10T06:21:00Z,2014-10-10,6:21,65441,Statement of Reaffirmation,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/27237.html,"Dear members of the campus community:
As chancellor, it is my responsibility to annually reaffirm our campus commitment to equal opportunity, affirmative action, and equal access.  This commitment is consistent with my unwavering belief that diversity, as part of a living, learning, and working community, is a cornerstone of excellence and a strategic imperative for us all in our effort to be a pre-eminent public research university with a land-grant mission and global impact.
The campus, as reflected by Inclusive Illinois, is committed to creating and maintaining a community that recognizes and values the inherent worth and dignity of every person, while fostering an environment of mutual respect among its members.  The campus takes seriously our responsibility to provide leadership in ensuring that equal employment opportunity, affirmative action, and equal access is our standard practice rather than an aspiration.  As such, university policy prohibits discrimination or harassment of any member of the campus community during any stage of the employment process.  This includes recruitment, selection, promotion, transfer, merit increases, salary, training and development, demotion, and separation on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, order of protection status, genetic information, marital status, disability, sexual orientation including gender identity and unfavorable discharge from the military or status as a protected veteran.  In addition, our affirmative action plan requires the campus to undertake good faith efforts to achieve the university’s affirmative action goals for women, minorities, persons with disabilities, and protected veterans.
In compliance with Title IX, the campus prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in employment as well as in admissions, enrollment, and in the provision of all services, programs and activities. The campus’s Title IX Office monitors compliance with this law and oversees the campus’s response to complaints of discrimination based on sex, including reported incidents of sexual assault.
The Office of Diversity, Equity, and Access (www.diversity.illinois.edu) is a resource for the campus and is available to address any campus concerns involving these matters.  Realizing our shared vision of an Inclusive Illinois requires that we all annually reaffirm our individual commitment to building a truly diverse, welcoming, and inclusive community of students, scholars and staff.
Sincerely,
Phyllis M. WiseChancellor"

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign recently completed a test of our emergency response and evacuation plans. The test included two components: a drill and an exercise. The drill (a test of our Illini-Alert emergency notification system) was initiated on Sept. 2nd at 10 a.m. This drill was announced ahead of time by campus Massmail and an Eweek notice. The Illini-Alert system sent an email to the illinois.edu addresses of all active faculty, staff and students. Those who have registered alternate email addresses also received an email notification. Those who have registered a cellphone were sent a text message during this drill.
In an attempt to increase the speed and breadth of emergency communications, the campus increased Illini-Alert modes of emergency communication to include Facebook, Twitter and our Emergency Web Alert System. This multi-modal approach provides a robust communication engine that will continue to function successfully even if one system fails to work properly.
If you have not signed up to receive emergency messages through Illini-Alert, please visit http://emergency.illinois.edu to register.
The second component of the test was a functional exercise conducted Sept. 9th from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 pm at the Champaign County Emergency Operations Center. The exercise was announced in advance via a campus Eweek notice. The functional exercise involved an F4 tornado that directly affected campus. The exercise scenario tested various components of the Campus Emergency Operations Plan, including evacuation procedures.
To view the University’s emergency response and evacuation procedures, please visit http://www.dps.illinois.edu/emergencyplanning/evacproc.html.

It’s a pleasure to welcome our students to the University of Illinois, whether you’re new and still finding your way around or coming back after a summer away.
The weeks, months and years ahead on our campuses will literally define your future – a time to explore career possibilities, lock in your goals and nurture the skills to achieve them.
Not that long ago, your time here would have been the capstone of your education, developing talents that would serve you for a lifetime.
But times have changed.
The University of Illinois is still a proven springboard to success, a premier university with a global reputation for excellence and more than 650,000 living alumni that include leaders at the very top of their fields. But today your education can’t end here. We now live in an era where lifelong learning is essential to keep pace with rapidly evolving technology that is redefining our workplaces, and to adapt as innovation creates career opportunities that were once unheard of and relegates others to memory.
So use your time here to learn not just the lessons at hand, but to ensure your education continues once you leave – fostering a sense of curiosity that keeps you looking ahead to the next hill rather than resting on the one you’ve already climbed.
This is truly a special place, a world leader in education and research, and I hope you seize the many life-changing opportunities it provides, both in the classroom and in your interactions with fellow students who will help you explore your newfound knowledge and expand your understanding of the world.
Again, welcome to the University of Illinois. I wish you a year filled with discovery and achievement, and be sure to have a little fun along the way.

2014-08-22T16:16:00Z,2014-08-22,16:16,72842,An atmosphere for learning,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/27181.html,"August 22, 2014
Earlier today, you received a thoughtful statement from Chancellor Phyllis Wise regarding the university’s decision not to recommend Prof. Steven Salaita for a tenured faculty position on the Urbana-Champaign campus.  
In her statement, Chancellor Wise reaffirmed her commitment to academic freedom and to fostering an environment that encourages diverging opinions, robust debate and challenging conventional norms. Those principles have been at the heart of the university’s mission for nearly 150 years, and have fueled its rise as a world leader in education and innovation.
But, as she noted, our excellence is also rooted in another guiding principle that is just as fundamental. Our campuses must be safe harbors where students and faculty from all backgrounds and cultures feel valued, respected and comfortable expressing their views.
We agree, and write today to add our collective and unwavering support of Chancellor Wise and her philosophy of academic freedom and free speech tempered in respect for human rights – these are the same core values which have guided this institution since its founding.
In the end, the University of Illinois will never be measured simply by the number of world-changing engineers, thoughtful philosophers or great artists we produce. We also have a responsibility to develop productive citizens of our democracy. As a nation, we are only as strong as the next generation of participants in the public sphere. The University of Illinois must shape men and women who will contribute as citizens in a diverse and multi-cultural democracy. To succeed in this mission, we must constantly reinforce our expectation of a university community that values civility as much as scholarship.
Disrespectful and demeaning speech that promotes malice is not an acceptable form of civil argument if we wish to ensure that students, faculty and staff are comfortable in a place of scholarship and education. If we educate a generation of students to believe otherwise, we will have jeopardized the very system that so many have made such great sacrifices to defend. There can be no place for that in our democracy, and therefore, there will be no place for it in our university.
Chancellor Wise is an outstanding administrator, leader and teacher. Her academic career has been built on her commitment to promoting academic freedom and creating a welcoming environment for students and faculty alike. We stand with her today and will be with her tomorrow as she devotes her considerable talent and energy to serving our students, our faculty and staff, and our society.
We look forward to working closely with Chancellor Wise and all of you to ensure that our university is recognized both for its commitment to academic freedom and as a national model of leading-edge scholarship framed in respect and courtesy.

As you may be aware, Vice President Christophe Pierre and I wrote to Prof. Steven Salaita on Aug. 1, informing him of the university’s decision not to recommend further action by the Board of Trustees concerning his potential appointment to the faculty of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
Since this decision, many of you have expressed your concern about its potential impact on academic freedom. I want to assure you in the strongest possible terms that all of us – my administration, the university administration and I – absolutely are committed to this bedrock principle. I began my career as a scientist challenging accepted ideas and pre-conceived notions, and I have continued during my career to invite and encourage such debates in all aspects of university life.
A pre-eminent university must always be a home for difficult discussions and for the teaching of diverse ideas. One of our core missions is to welcome and encourage differing perspectives. Robust – and even intense and provocative – debate and disagreement are deeply valued and critical to the success of our university.
As a university community, we also are committed to creating a welcoming environment for faculty and students alike to explore the most difficult, contentious and complex issues facing our society today. Our Inclusive Illinois initiative is based on the premise that education is a process that starts with our collective willingness to search for answers together – learning from each other in a respectful way that supports a diversity of worldviews, histories and cultural knowledge.
The decision regarding Prof. Salaita was not influenced in any way by his positions on the conflict in the Middle East nor his criticism of Israel. Our university is home to a wide diversity of opinions on issues of politics and foreign policy. Some of our faculty are critical of Israel, while others are strong supporters. These debates make us stronger as an institution and force advocates of all viewpoints to confront the arguments and perspectives offered by others. We are a university built on precisely this type of dialogue, discourse and debate.
What we cannot and will not tolerate at the University of Illinois are personal and disrespectful words or actions that demean and abuse either viewpoints themselves or those who express them. We have a particular duty to our students to ensure that they live in a community of scholarship that challenges their assumptions about the world but that also respects their rights as individuals.
As chancellor, it is my responsibility to ensure that all perspectives are welcome and that our discourse, regardless of subject matter or viewpoint, allows new concepts and differing points of view to be discussed in and outside the classroom in a scholarly, civil and productive manner.
A Jewish student, a Palestinian student, or any student of any faith or background must feel confident that personal views can be expressed and that philosophical disagreements with a faculty member can be debated in a civil, thoughtful and mutually respectful manner. Most important, every student must know that every instructor recognizes and values that student as a human being. If we have lost that, we have lost much more than our standing as a world-class institution of higher education.
As a member of the faculty, I firmly believe that a tenured faculty position at the University of Illinois is a tremendous honor and a unique privilege. Tenure also brings with it a heavy responsibility to continue the traditions of scholarship and civility upon which our university is built.
I am committed to working closely with you to identify how the campus administration can support our collective duty to inspire and facilitate thoughtful consideration of diverse opinions and discourse on challenging issues.
Sincerely,
Phyllis M. WiseChancellor"

We are pleased to let you know that in order to establish a more equitable distribution model, effective July 1, 2014, the standard distribution of Indirect Cost Recovery generated from sponsored research will be handled for most units as follows:
45% of indirect cost recoveries (ICR) related to facilities and administration (F&A) will be distributed to the college/department/principal investigator.  The division of these funds within each college will be based on the college’s policy for distribution.
75% of ICR earnings related to tuition remission will be distributed to the academic college of the student generating the remission. The division of these funds within each college will be based on the college’s policy for distribution.
Special F&A distribution policies were developed for units not fitting the standard distribution model.  This included the large multidisciplinary units such as Beckman and IGB, along with a number of other units. The special distributions were developed to avoid creating either windfalls or deficits for units.   For principal investigators whose appointment is in an academic college subject to the standard distribution above, ICR will be returned to the home college following the standard distribution above, regardless of where their grants are managed.  A summary of the ICR distribution policies can be found here.
This new policy reflects the recommendations of the 2012 Indirect Cost Recovery Steering and Working Groups. The committees included stakeholders from a number of campus units and their report can be found here. Additional policy documents and resources for business managers will be available soon. In the meantime, if you have questions, please consult your business staff.

In the last week individuals at the University of Illinois were targets of sophisticated phishing emails. Given the level of sophistication and corresponding with similar known phishing attacks experience by other Big Ten schools, the Office of Privacy and Information Assurance (OPIA) believes this attack was done in an effort to gather enough information to access University resources and to potentially change personal information, such as payroll direct deposit information. The message was allegedly from ""UIUC Human Resources"" and directed recipients to a copy of a University of Illinois Enterprise Authentication Login page, but had an additional field for their PIN.
This message did not rely on individuals replying with sensitive information, but instead directed them to a site designed to steal their information. To see an example from this latest phishing attack please visit: <https://security.illinois.edu/content/july-2014-phishing-attempt>. As a habit you should check the address bar of your web browser when you are online. You should only enter your University of Illinois username and password on sites that have illinois.edu or uillinois.edu at the beginning of the address. Any website that is asking for sensitive information should begin with HTTPS.
In response to this attack OPIA has notified the recipients of this message and is monitoring affected accounts for suspicious changes. In addition to responding directly to this incident OPIA and CITES are working on changes to better protect the University of Illinois and its members.
Given the growing trend for these attacks and the likelihood that this will not be the last time we will see an attack like this you should familiarize yourself on how to determine the authenticity of University emails and what is being asked of you. For more information about phishing and how to spot it please visit: <https://security.illinois.edu/content/spotting-phishing-attempts>. If you are unsure whether an email or phone call is from the University of Illinois, you can contact the CITES Help Desk by emailing consult@illinois.edu or by phone at 217-244-7000. When in doubt, please contact the Help Desk.
If you receive a phishing email claiming to be from the University of Illinois you can simply delete it, or you can inform CITES by emailing report-spam@illinois.edu. Please be aware that the University of Illinois will never ask you to reply to an email with your password or to update account information through email.

Interests and Needs Survey
High-performance computers have become essential to research in almost every discipline across the University campus. The Illinois Campus Cluster is a campus wide resource that meets this need for research computing cycles. The Illinois Campus Cluster Program (http://campuscluster.illinois.edu/) was initiated three years ago to meet this need for research computing cycles. 
As we continue to develop the Illinois Campus Cluster Program, we ask that you submit your technical requirements via our Interests and Needs Survey for the next instance of the shared campus research cluster. To date, the first and second instances of the Illinois Campus Cluster Program, Taub and Golub, have been quite successful and have been a very cost efficient solution for faculty with funds for investing in research computing resources. This survey is the primary mechanism by which we collect and understand the needs of the Illinois research community.
Intense study of the University's financial situation has led to recommendations for controlling operating cost while maintaining or enhancing our effectiveness in carrying out the institution's missions. Both the Stewarding Excellence Report (http://oc.illinois.edu/budget/projectteams.html#itatillinois) and the Administrative Review and Restructuring Report (http://www.uillinois.edu/arr/) point out an opportunity to improve our research capacity and competitiveness while decreasing total cost of research computing through the creation of a consolidated research computing cluster.
In support of this, the Illinois Campus Cluster Program has deployed the first and second instance of the Illinois Campus Cluster Program called Taub and Golub respectfully. These two instances are intended to be the first in a series of research computing resource deployments. Researchers are responsible only for investing in compute resources, storage, and specialized software licenses. As a result, researchers are able to:   * acquire up to 20% more resources with their available funding;   * allow faculty, research staff and graduate students to focus on their research and not be distracted with the responsibility of operating these resources;   * have the resources managed by a professional team providing support for security patches, attempted hacks, operating system upgrades, and hardware repair, operations and support;   * leverage university-supported infrastructure such as networking, racks, floor space, cooling, and power; and   * leverage the Campus Cluster Program staff efforts in working with vendors to obtain the best price for computing resources by pooling funds from different disciplines to leverage greater group purchasing power. If you need assistance in completing this survey to understand how best to express your needs, please feel free to contact our Illinois Campus Cluster User Services (staffed from the NCSA Consulting Office on the Urbana campus) at 217-244-1144 or via email at help@campuscluster.illinois.edu. We appreciate your time and input to make this program as successful and responsive to the needs of Illinois researchers as possible.  Your response to the Interests and Needs Survey  by August 15, 2014 will be appreciated.

I am pleased to inform you that the University of Illinois will provide a merit-based general salary program of 2.5 percent, effective with the new appointment year in August. The program was developed after consultation with the chancellors, provosts and vice presidents and will be applicable to all campus and University Administration employees, except for employees whose wages are set through the collective bargaining process. Because the salary program will determine raises based on merit and performance, a significant range of increases is expected within units.
A competitive employee compensation program is essential to recruit and retain the top faculty and staff who are the core of our excellence. It is among our highest priorities. Despite continuing uncertainty about the financial circumstances of the State, I am pleased that the careful stewardship of our resources has put us in a position to offer a reasoned salary program for our employees.
Thank you for everything that you do for the University of Illinois.

Dear colleagues:
We invite you to attend one of the town hall meetings that have been scheduled on each of our campuses this month to provide input for the committee leading the search to replace retiring President Robert Easter.
The open-microphone forums are an opportunity for faculty, staff, students, alumni and community members to share thoughts to help guide the search – from the challenges that a new president will face to the personal qualities needed for the position. Several members of the presidential search committee will attend each meeting, and input from the forums will be presented to the full committee.
Town hall meetings, by campus, will be held:
     Springfield – 11 a.m. June 23 in Room 3080 of University Hall
     Chicago – 2 p.m. June 24 in the Michele M. Thompson rooms at Student Center West
     Urbana-Champaign – 1 p.m. June 25 in the Beckman Auditorium
The Board of Trustees launched the presidential search in March, appointing a 19-member committee that will develop job qualifications and then identify and screen potential candidates. The committee will recommend finalists to the board, which intends to name a replacement by late this fall to ensure a smooth transition before President Easter leaves office.
We hope you can attend one of the town hall meetings, and look forward to your insights.Sincerely,
Pamela B. Strobel, member, Board of TrusteesDouglas H. Beck, professor of physics, Urbana campusCommittee co-chairs"

For the 2014 summer semester, the Student Health Insurance plan will continue to be administered by UnitedHealthcare. Students will have 24/7 electronic access to their student insurance coverage information at www.uhcsr.com/MyAccount. Following the Enrollment/Change period at the beginning of the semester, students that have not exempted out of the Student Health plan will be contacted by United Healthcare via e-mail with instructions on how to access their account information. Students who wish to access their information prior to the end of the Enrollment/Change period may do so by enrolling early, using the “enrollment form” found online at www.uhcsr.com/illinois, and then accessing their “MyAccount” at the web address listed above. Once you’ve created your account you will have the ability to:
Print your own ID card
Review Message Center electronic notifications
Check claims and Explanation of Benefits (EOB)
Review Claims Letters
Update personal information
Look up a network provider
Provide other insurance information, accident details, or Personal Representative Appointment
Add dependent information
What does this mean to you? 
As of August 21st, 2013, claims are no longer processed by the UIUC Student Health Insurance office. All NEW claims from the 2012-2013 plan year and onward must be sent to UnitedHealthcare for processing. The address for submission of claims is located on the back of your health insurance card.
All direct inquiries regarding NEW claims processed after August 21, 2013 should be directed to UnitedHealthcare at 888-224-4883 or claims@uhcsr.com.
Will the Student Health Insurance office remain on campus?
Yes, students will have the option to visit the current Student Health Insurance Office located at 506 South Wright Street, Henry Administration Building, Room 100A; e-mail the office at insure@illinois.edu or call 217-333-0165 for general questions and inquiries (e.g. assistance with printing ID cards, questions regarding plan exemption status, reinstatement or extension of coverage, claims processed prior to August 21, 2013, and general policy information).  
When is the Enrollment/Change period?
The Student Health Insurance Enrollment/Change period will run from 05/17/2014 - 06/16/2014 for the summer 2014 semester.  This is the only time during the summer 2014 semester that students can apply for reinstatement (further details below), add dependent coverage, or exempt from the student health insurance plan.  No applications will be accepted after the June 16, 2014 deadline.
How do I apply for an Exemption?
Students can apply for exemption from the Student Health Insurance plan online by visiting www.uhcsr.com/illinois .  Students who were approved for an exemption prior to the Fall 2013 semester are “grandfathered in”, and do not need to reapply; their exemption status will remain unchanged. All other students seeking an exemption for the first time after the Fall 2013 semester, must re-apply on an annual basis. To check your exemption status, look on your e-bill to see if you have been charged the UIUC Student Insurance fee (undergraduate fee $254.00, graduate fee $328.00). If you have not been charged the fee, you are not covered by this plan.  Some students may not qualify to be assessed the fee; these may include students registered in absentia, registered for no-credit courses, or registered for credit in an ""off campus experience"".  
What steps do I take to cover my dependent and/or spouse?
Students covered under the plan for the 2013-2014 plan year can enroll their dependents by first early enrolling using the “enrollment form” at www.uhcsr.com/Illinois and then accessing www.uhcsr.com/MyAccount and making the appropriate fee payment directly to UnitedHealthcare. Any and all payments must be submitted prior to the end of the Enrollment/Change period.  
I previously exempted out of the plan but need coverage this year, what do I do?
Reinstatement into the Student Health Insurance plan can be done in person at the Student Insurance office. Students seeking to reinstate must do so either:
1)     Within 63 days of the termination of their other insurance;
                                           or
2)     During the Enrollment/Change period, if a student does not reinstate within 63 days of the termination of their other insurance, their application will not be accepted after the Enrollment/Change period deadline.
For questions regarding the Student Health Insurance plan or the upcoming changes please contact the Student Health Insurance Office at 217-333-0165 or insure@uiuc.edu."

Dear colleagues:
As you have likely seen in the news, a Sangamon County judge yesterday postponed the scheduled June 1 implementation of the state’s new pension law until constitutional challenges can be decided by the courts. 
Judge John Belz recognized that members of the pension system could suffer “irreparable harm” if the law had been allowed to go forward before questions over its constitutionality are resolved. It is unknown how long the process will take, but legal analysts expect that the case will ultimately be decided by the Illinois Supreme Court.  There is a status hearing in the case scheduled for May 22.
Depending on how courts rule, provisions of the new law may still be implemented sometime in the future. But, for now, yesterday’s ruling preserves the current pension system as we know it, and provides some assurance for employees who were considering retirement before June 30, 2014, to avoid losing benefits they had already earned.
I hope that faculty and staff who were weighing retirement will now decide to stay on and share their talents to benefit the university, our students and our state.
Others have already tendered their resignations, fearful of its negative impact on their retirement benefits. If any of them now wish to return, the University will make every effort to consider their request.  Employees should contact their direct supervisor to begin these discussions.
My thanks to all of you for your patience and understanding amid the months of uncertainty over the new pension law, and for your loyalty and service to this great University.
Sincerely,
Robert A. Easter

Dear colleagues:
Yesterday, the board of the State Universities Retirement System (SURS) approved an emergency rule that will preserve benefits employees have already earned under the “money purchase” option.
The SURS board’s emergency ruling addresses an unintended glitch in the state’s new pension law, and guarantees that the retirement benefits employees have earned as of June 30, 2014, will not be reduced – even if they retire months or years later.
Before the ruling, those benefit levels under “money purchase” would have been locked in as of June 30, 2013, eliminating a year of contributions and interest, and creating an incentive for employees to retire, whether they wanted to or not.
More details are expected next week on the SURS website.
I hope that the SURS ruling provides assurance to employees who were considering retirement before June 30, 2014, to avoid losing benefits they had already earned. And I hope they will now stay with us – sharing the talents that are the heart of our excellence and our standing as a world leader in education and innovation.
Employees will receive an email from Human Resources with additional information.
Needless to say, the SURS ruling provides a fix only for the glitch in the “money purchase” option, and there are other provisions of the state’s new pension law that will negatively impact employees when it takes effect on July 1, 2014. Whether those provisions hold will ultimately be decided as legal challenges to the new law make their way through the courts.
I am grateful to the SURS board for its decision to correct the “money purchase” problem, and its efforts to curb large-scale retirements that would have cut deeply into the quality of our academic and research missions, and our service to students and the state.
I also want to thank House Speaker Michael Madigan, whose letter to SURS helped clarify the legislature’s intent to preserve money purchase benefits that have already been earned.
And I want to thank University of Illinois Board of Trustees Chairman Christopher Kennedy and Avijit Ghosh, my senior advisor, for their leadership on this critical issue and their commitment to our employees by personally attending the SURS board meeting and advocating on behalf of employees at the state’s public universities.

The University of Illinois is working to convince legislators to correct an unintended glitch in the new public pension funding law that could reduce benefits for some employees if they don’t opt to retire before June 30.
University officials, employees, and the Alumni Association’s Illinois Connection advocacy group are urging lawmakers to act swiftly to correct the error in the effective date for a change in the “money purchase” benefit calculation because there could be an exodus of employees potentially affected by the change.
University trustees heard from faculty and senior administrators on the unintended consequences—disruption of academic continuity, loss of research grants, costs associated with mass retirements and replacement hiring—at a special meeting on April 18. A video excerpt of remarks made during the meeting and a selection of recent news articles about the problem are included at the web page below.

As you probably know, for over three years we have been working on guidelines and policies to better recognize and support specialized faculty.
Earlier this month we released Provost communication No. 25 - Employment Guidelines for Specialized Faculty Holding Non-Tenure System Positions. The document provides employment guidelines and policies for specialized faculty related to titles, promotional tracks, hiring procedures, performance evaluations, unit involvement and profesional development (http://provost.illinois.edu/communication/25/ProvostCommNo25_SpecializedFaculty.pdf). I am writing to inform you of current activities that will move our campus forward on the principles spelled out in the Guidelines.
After benchmarking salaries for specialized faculty in a sampling of areas among peer institutions, we have determined that it is appropriate to set a minimum for non-visiting positions of $40,000/year for full-time 9-month appointments. We are working with colleges to implement any necessary adjustments to base salaries as soon as possible.
In addition, we are working with various departments and schools to revise their bylaws and current practices so as to be consistent with our goals.  Clarity regarding the roles, responsibilities and privileges of specialized faculty members, including a requirment for access to grievance processes, is a primary focus of this effort.
Specialized faculty members (""other academics"" as defined under the University Statutes) serve an integral part of the university function, through teaching and through research. These individuals may work for a single semester or may dedicate years of service to the University. Provost Communication No. 25 was created to recognize the value specialized faculty add to the institution.
In the coming months, I will share additional progress on the overall efforts to enhance support and employment matters affecting specialized faculty.
Best,

Dear colleagues,
I write today out of concern over an unintended glitch in the wording of the state’s public pension funding law that would significantly reduce pension benefits under the “money purchase” option if retirement-eligible employees continue working beyond June 30, 2014.
The wording was actually meant to preserve (or “hold harmless”) employee benefits when the new pension law lowers the interest rate used to calculate monthly annuities under “money purchase,” effective July 1, 2014. It sought to lock in annuities for retirement-eligible employees to the level they would receive on June 30, 2014, even if they retired months or years later.
But through an apparent drafting error, the clause set the guarantee date as June 30, 2013, rather than June 30, 2014. That eliminates a year of pension contributions and interest, and reduces benefits. For eligible employees it may be an incentive to retire even if they had not intended or wished to do so.
We have been in contact with the legislature to address this problem and I am hopeful a remedy will be approved in time to protect the benefits that our retirement-eligible faculty and staff have earned. But it needs to happen sooner rather than later; every day that passes, we face the very real threat of losing more of the faculty and staff who are the foundation of our standing as one of the world’s premier universities.
At a special meeting of the Board of Trustees last week in which trustees were briefed on the “money purchase” predicament, they urged us to redouble our push for a swift and immediate correction in the law. The meeting helped draw public attention to the threat posed by the drafting error, through extensive media coverage and editorials on the topic.
Trustees also encouraged faculty, staff, students, alumni and friends of the University to join us in voicing support for correction in the law. Alumni can communicate through the Illinois Connection program, the legislative advocacy unit of the Alumni Association.
Advocating for support of the University and its employees with respect to a correction of the law regarding the “money purchase” benefit option, either directly or through Illinois Connection, is not prohibited by university or campus policies or the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act. Employees should exercise care to ensure these activities do not negatively impact fulfillment of employment responsibilities.
We will continue our efforts to ensure that our benefits enable us to attract the best-in-class faculty and staff who have made the University of Illinois a world leader in education and innovation. Thank you for your patience, your support and your service to this great University.

2014-04-18T12:01:00Z,2014-04-18,12:1,15894,Sharing a feasibility study on a new College of Medicine,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/27112.html,"Dear Colleagues: As you may have heard, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the Carle Healthcare System jointly commissioned a study on the feasibility of developing a new medical college at Urbana-Champaign. We are pleased to share the results of this study with you. Our two institutions recruited Tripp Umbach to analyze the feasibility of developing an engineering-focused medical college jointly owned and governed by Carle and the university. Tripp Umbach is a national leader in feasibility analysis, economic impact studies and consultation services for universities, hospitals, academic medical centers and biomedical organizations.
We commissioned this feasibility study for two major reasons.
First, the U.S. healthcare system is undergoing historic transformation driven by an aging population with more chronic conditions, an influx of millions of new people into the healthcare system due to the Affordable Care Act, and a severe physician shortage.  In addition, the convergence of engineering, technology and medicine will lead to discoveries that will result in greater access to better healthcare at lower cost for more people. Studying how to best address this new reality is consistent with Carle’s mission to serve people through high quality care, medical research and education.
Second, the university’s Visioning Future Excellence initiative identified health and wellness, information and technology and economic development as three themes the university should focus its investments upon in order to meet society’s greatest challenges http:// http://oc.illinois.edu/visioning. The Business Cluster Development report identified biomedical and bioengineering as a technology cluster that would enhance economic development in our region http://go.illinois.edu/technologyclusterdevelopment. However, that report states that the lack of a full scale medical program prevents us from realizing the potential economic development impact of this cluster. Illinois and Carle each would bring unique strengths to a different model for a college of medicine:
There is no U.S. public research university better positioned than Illinois to leverage the convergence of engineering with medicine and be a leader in the transformation of health care research, education, practice and delivery. The Urbana campus already has the assets, including one of the nation’s top-five engineering schools and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. All of the top 10 medical schools in the country already partner with faculty members at the Urbana campus in the College of Engineering and the Computer Science and Genomics programs. Yet, the university does not have its own medical college on campus to take advantage of these opportunities. Additionally, the campus receives more annual funding from the National Science Foundation than almost any other institution.
As the only health system in Illinois that owns its own health plan, and one of the state’s largest providers of clinical care, Carle is a leader in high quality, cost-effective and better-coordinated patient care. That allows improvements in systems of care, rather than focusing in one area of healthcare delivery – a capability that has led to Carle being consistently recognized among the best in the state and the nation. This structure allows flexibility to rapidly advance care delivery through programmatic changes, early adoption of technology and research. As a physician-led and patient-centered organization, Carle can maximize this model to provide the best outcomes possible for patients.
Tripp Umbach reviewed many approaches and ultimately recommends developing a specialized engineering-based medical college in Urbana-Champaign that would be the nation’s first medical school designed for the express purpose of fusing engineering, computing, health sciences and medicine. It would train physician-scientists to shape the future of healthcare delivery, practice and technology. This specialized engineering-based medical college would advance health care and improve patient outcomes. It would grow the state’s biotech sector and serve as an international magnet for innovation and scholarship. Investment and new jobs would flow into Illinois at a faster pace.
We are excited by these findings and, in coming months, will analyze and interpret the initial recommendations along with additional information to be developed. As part of the process it will be necessary for our respective governing bodies to consider and approve the important initiative. We hope you will take time to review the report, which is available at: http://go.illinois.edu/collegeofmedicinestudy.

Through engaging with our colleagues and peers and sharing our voices—whether in a research lab, classroom, or over lunch on the quad—we are able to fully understand and appreciate the value of our diverse experiences, perspectives, and ideas.
I hope each of you—faculty, staff, and students—will join me in celebrating Inclusive Illinois week from April 7 to April 11. Share your voice as part of the #manyvoices event; attend FashionAble Fundraiser—a fashion show in support of the Division of Disability Resources and Educational Services at the University of Illinois; celebrate through exhibits, music, and food the amazing contributions of women on our campus; hear from a passionate advocate for same-sex marriage as part of the Chancellor’s Lecture Series on Diversity and Cultural Understanding; and end the week with your family and friends at the free tailgate and baseball game as part of Inclusive Illinois Baseball Day as Illinois takes on Michigan. For more information about Inclusive Illinois week, visit inclusiveillinois.illinois.edu.
Thank you for your commitment to an inclusive Illinois and celebrating the many voices that makes up our Illinois community.
Sincerely,
Phyllis M. WiseChancellor"

Dear colleagues:
Gov. Quinn unveiled his fiscal 2015 budget blueprint yesterday, and we are grateful that he is seeking alternatives to avert deep spending cuts for higher education and maintain funding at current levels.The governor’s proposal is predicated on making permanent the temporary increase in the state’s income tax that is set to expire at the end of the year. Without that revenue, the governor recognizes that extreme cuts in the state’s spending would be required, including a 12.5 percent reduction for the University of Illinois.The reduction would result in an $82.7 million loss of state support for the University and would cut deeply into our core missions of education, research, public service and economic development.  It would be felt in every phase of our operation – student tuition, class sizes, the quality of academic and research programs, medical services and education, our workforce, and the University’s ability to deliver the highly skilled graduates and leading-edge innovation that help drive progress and economic growth.  The potential 12.5 percent reduction would come on the heels of a decade that saw the University’s annual state appropriation decrease by more than $130 million, along with delays in payments from the state that have at times topped $500 million. Despite those challenges, we have managed to remain on firm financial footing, maintaining our value to students and society through prudent fiscal stewardship, ongoing efforts to control spending and tuition increases that have shifted more educational costs to our students. But we cannot absorb yet another reduction of this magnitude without considerable pain. We laid out the potential consequences last week during hearings before the House and Senate Higher Education Appropriations Committees and will do everything possible to prevent such an outcome.The governor’s proposal is the first step in the legislature’s budget process, and we will continue to champion the University’s best interests at every opportunity. Our goal is to hold state funding equal to the current fiscal year, providing the dollars that are so critical to meet the needs of our students, our employees and the state, and maintain the academic and research excellence that is synonymous with the University of Illinois.

Dear Colleagues,
As you probably are aware, many features of the retirement programs administered by the State Universities Retirement System (SURS) may change as a result of the enactment of PA 98-599, a comprehensive overhaul of public pension funding for the state of Illinois. Although the new law is being challenged in court as unconstitutional, it will become effective on June 1 unless a judicial stay is granted.
The changes mandated by the law will significantly impact faculty and staff retirement benefits, especially for those hired prior to January 1, 2011. SURS has prepared several informative resources to assist in understanding the impact of the new law. I encourage you to read http://www.surs.org/news-article/021314/learn-facts-about-pension-reform and an upcoming special edition of the SURS “Advocate” newsletter. SURS is also providing expanded counseling services for individual members. A list of available informational resources is provided later in this communication.We are keenly aware of the adverse impact of the pension funding changes in the new law for members of the University community. The Board of Trustees has directed the University to explore potential options, including supplementary programs, to ensure that our retirement system is competitive with those of our peers.
While we explore those options and confer with SURS and elected officials in Springfield, many employees are assessing the law’s impact on them. It is important to make informed decisions based on facts, which is why I urge you to utilize the resources listed here.
Sincerely,
Robert A. EasterPresident

The second annual Community & Campus Day of Service will be held on Saturday, April 5 at Memorial Stadium to kick off National Volunteer Week, April 6-12.  As you may recall from the inaugural event last April, more than 1,500 volunteers came together to participate in a number of service projects, including a food packaging project that eventually provided 146,000 meals to the Eastern Illinois Foodbank.  This year, I hope we will see even more volunteers and units involved in the Day of Service.  Please encourage those in your units to get involved either by volunteering for an existing project or by participating in some sort of community service on their own or as a unit during National Volunteer Week. 
Opportunities for volunteering will include:
A food packaging project on April 5 with a goal of providing 147,000 meals to Eastern Illinois Foodbank (1,000 meals for each year of the University’s public engagement mission)
Service projects throughout Champaign-Urbana as part of Austin's Day on April 12
Coming up with a unit volunteer project during National Volunteer Week (last year, Beckman and Fine & Applied Arts both offered projects open to volunteers inside and outside of the unit)
Visit CUVolunteer.org for additional volunteer opportunities (individual or group)
Please be sure to ask those in your unit to report any unit or individual community service so we can count the hours they spend in the Community & Campus Day of Service total throughout National Volunteer Week.  Remember that the projects are open to anyone in the community, and several are family friendly (children 5 years of age and up can participate in food packaging), so invite others to join you!  More information is available at http://go.illinois.edu/dayofservice, including registration and reporting for volunteer projects. 
Thank you for your support of this important annual event.  I believe it is so critical for us to demonstrate to our students the importance of service in their communities, and it is a great team building opportunity as well.

I am delighted to share with you that Professor David Eastwood, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom will offer a public talk on March 10 at 1:30 p.m. in room 1005 of the Beckman Institute, entitled ""Through a Glass Darkly: What the Future of Higher Education Might Be.""
Vice-Chancellor Eastwood’s talk will focus on how higher education is changing to address society’s changing needs. As we envision our campus 20 to 50 years into the future, we are exploring how to best position the university for continued relevance and impact. Vice-Chancellor Eastwood’s service on numerous national bodies and committees contributing to recent, often dramatic discussions and policy changes in UK higher education and research provide a unique perspective on this critical topic.
Dr. Eastwood has served as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Birmingham since April 2009, having previously served as the Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), the Vice-Chancellor of the University of East Anglia, and the Chief Executive of the Arts and Humanities Research Board. He held a chair in Modern History at the University of Wales, Swansea, where he also served as Head of Department, Dean, and Pro-Vice-Chancellor and co-founded the National Centre for Public Policy.
 In addition, he has served on numerous national bodies and committees influencing UK higher education and research, including as a member of the Roberts Review of the Research Assessment Exercise, the Tomlinson Group on 14-19 Education 2003-2004, and the Board of the Quality Assurance Agency.  He has chaired the 1994 Group of Universities, the UUK’s Longer Term Strategy Group, and the Westminster Education Commission. More recently he was a member of the Government's Independent Review Panel looking at Higher Education Funding and Student Finance. He is currently Chair of the Russell Group of Universities, a Director of Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), and a Board Member of Universities UK (UUK). He is also a member of the Advisory Board of the Higher Education Policy Institute.

Twelve years after the release of the Windows XP operating system, Microsoft is ending all support for Windows XP on April 8, 2014.
After this date Microsoft will no longer provide security updates to Windows XP. Any computer running XP will have a significantly higher risk of being infected with a virus or other malware, potentially exposing personal information or being used to attack other computers and websites.
To protect University users and resources and comply with campus policy [1], the Office of Privacy and Information Assurance (OPIA) will begin blocking computers with Windows XP from the campus network after April 8, 2014. A blocked computer will not be able to access the Internet, internal campus sites, or other campus resources.
This means that if you use a computer running Windows XP on-campus, either through a wired or wireless connection, or connect to campus resources through a VPN after April 8, 2014, the computer will be blocked. If you are using a computer running Windows XP from off-campus it will continue to run, but you will be putting yourself, and any information stored on the computer, at risk. Because of this risk, you should not store any university data on a Windows XP machine, even if it is located off-campus.

As responsible adults, students are asked to take responsibility for their behavior and its impact on others, particularly with respect to safety.  Unfortunately, in past years, the event has led to serious injuries and at least two deaths. We want to make it clear that the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign does not sponsor or sanction Unofficial St. Patrick's Day.  On that day, as on other days, the University responds to all violations of the Student Code, regardless of where the behavior occurs. Such violations include consuming alcohol as a minor, providing alcohol to minors, damage and destruction of property, dangerous activities such as throwing items from balconies, and acts of physical violence and sexual aggression. The consequences for such violations will be assigned commensurate with the seriousness of the behavior. As a reminder, disciplinary records are subject to review in background checks by graduate schools and future employers. Students may be dismissed as a result of their dangerous behavior and irresponsible choices on Unofficial St. Patrick's Day.   At the University, students who host guests will be held accountable for negative consequences incurred by their guests, with respect to property damage or threats to others' safety. If a guest or visitor is cited or arrested for illegal activity, the University will forward this information to any college or university where that guest may be enrolled for disciplinary action.  Additionally, there is an amendment, enacted last year, to the law which holds individuals (social hosts) criminally responsible for hosting an event or social gathering (party) where he or she knowingly authorizes or permits a residence which he or she occupies to be used for underage possession or consumption of alcohol. Violation of the law can lead to being charged with a Class A misdemeanor (which carries up to 364 days in jail and a $2,500 fine) or a Class 4 Felony (which carries up to 3 years in jail and a $25,000 fine). Hosts found serving or allowing minors to possess alcohol or charging admission will be arrested on state charges and transported to the Champaign County Jail.   Given the serious consequences that could occur, we strongly urge you to choose responsible behavior and ask that you look out for the safety of yourselves and others, particularly in this cold winter weather we’re experiencing.

While the University does not support or condone this event, steps are being taken to ensure safety and to minimize disruption to classes and campus operations.
The Champaign, Urbana, and University of Illinois police departments, assisted by other local and state agencies, will patrol the campus district on March 7. They will enforce all applicable ordinances in commercial and residential areas, and have authority to intervene if private parties threaten to disturb the peace. In addition, Champaign and Urbana officials will enact restrictions on liquor sales intended to curb overconsumption. Emergency medical personnel will be available to provide care as necessary.
University police will continue to focus on protecting students, staff, faculty, and University property. In case of emergency, call METCAD at 911. For non-emergencies, call 333-1216.
As in years past, we have made clear to students that academic business will continue as usual on Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. That has helped to minimize disruptions. Instructors should not need to alter instructional plans.
The Student Code http://www.admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/ addresses student responsibilities on campus. Sections 1-102(d) and 1-302(f) concern classroom conduct expectations, and section 1-307 focuses on alcohol consumption. The Code empowers instructors to ask disruptive students to leave class; after class, names of disruptive students should be reported to the Office for Student Conflict Resolution at 333-3680 or online at http://www.conflictresolution.illinois.edu/forms/incidentReport/form.asp.
If asking a disruptive student to leave class could escalate into a confrontation, you may seek assistance. From 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on March 7, teams of Student Affairs and Academic Affairs professionals will walk through and around buildings with classrooms and lecture halls where disruptions were experienced in the past. Team members, wearing University IDs, may be summoned to help. Teams will be prepared to document apparent Code violations and to call University police, if necessary.
Students will be asked not to bring any liquids into Foellinger Auditorium and Lincoln Hall Theatre. Longstanding policy prohibits liquids and food in these spaces.
Students who interfere with the academic mission of the University will face serious consequences. Thank you for reinforcing this message before and on March 7.

OCCURRED: Saturday, February 22, 2014 at 2:05 a.m.
LOCATION:  1100 W. Pennsylvania Avenue, Urbana (map)
BRIEF DETAILS:
On Saturday, February 22, 2014 at approximately 2:05 a.m. two females were walking near Pennsylvania Avenue and Dorner Drive in Urbana. The offender approached them and asked them for the time and then began to follow them. The offender followed the females to the area southwest of the Soybean Research Building (1100 W Pennsylvania Avenue) where he began groping and touching one of the females. He then pushed the female into a pile of snow and stood over her while he continued to grope her. The second female called 911 and the offender fled the scene.
OFFENDER DESCRIPTIONS:
The females described the offender as a multiracial (white/black) male with a light brown skin tone, approximately 5’04” - 5’08” tall, thin build, and thin mustache with no other facial hair. He was wearing a blue stocking cap, blue pullover windbreaker (no zipper or hood), blue spandex type running pants, and tennis shoes.
Information about the race or ethnicity of alleged offenders is provided only to aid detailed descriptions that include physical stature, clothing or unusual characteristics. Racial descriptions do not, by themselves, offer a meaningful picture of an individual's appearance.
POLICE RESPONSE:
The University of Illinois Police Department is working to identify and apprehend the offender. Witnesses to this event or those with information are encouraged to contact the University Police Department at 333-1216 or Crime Stoppers at 373-TIPS (8477).
SAFETY INFORMATION:
Members of the campus community are strongly encouraged to follow these safety tips to decrease their potential for becoming a victim:
Stay alert - call the police immediately to report suspicious activity and/or if this subject is observed.
Trust your instincts - if it does not feel right, call for help.
Avoid walking alone at night. Travel in groups when possible and always walk in well-lit, heavily traveled areas.
Turn down your electronic devices. Excessive volume or use of electronic devices (iPods, PDAs, cell phones, etc.) can distract you from potential safety hazards.
If you choose to consume alcohol, please drink moderately - remember your ability to respond is diminished by over-consumption of alcohol.

Community service represents a critical part of the University of Illinois culture. I am proud that so many of you take part in service activities through fraternities and sororities, registered student organizations, service learning courses and so many other avenues. This is just one of the things that brings our Illinois family together and makes our local community such a vibrant place to live.
The second annual Community & Campus Day of Service will be held on Saturday, April 5th at Memorial Stadium to kick off National Volunteer Week, April 6-12. Last year at the inaugural event, we had more than 1,500 volunteers for a number of projects, one of which eventually delivered 146,000 meals to the Eastern Illinois Foodbank for the hungry right here in our community. I encourage you to get involved in this year’s Day of Service with your friends, our faculty and staff, and members of our community.
Opportunities for volunteering will include:
Another food packaging project on April 5th with a goal of providing 147,000 meals to Eastern Illinois Foodbank (1,000 meals for each year of the University’s public engagement mission)
Service projects throughout Champaign-Urbana as part of Austin’s Day on April 12
Coming up with a service project of your own during National Volunteer Week
Visit CUVolunteer.org for additional volunteer opportunities (individual or group)
Please be sure to report any group or individual community service outside of the offered projects so we can count the hours you spend in the Community & Campus Day of Service total throughout National Volunteer Week. You can find information on how to add your service on the campus site linked below. Remember that the projects are open to anyone in the community, and several are family friendly (children 5 years of age and up can participate in food packaging), so invite others to join you! More information is available at go.illinois.edu/dayofservice.
Thank you for your dedication to service in the local community and beyond. I hope to see many of you take part in the Day of Service and National Volunteer Week activities this spring.
Sincerely,
Phyllis M. WiseChancellor"

Last fall nearly 600 of you -- faculty members, undergraduate and graduate students, academic professionals and civil service staff – took part in the first round of the Campus Conversation on Undergraduate Education.  In a series of small meetings you articulated a compelling vision of the Illinois graduate, and the educational experience that produces this ideal.  I am sincerely grateful to everyone who gave their time, thought, and enthusiasm to this project. 
A report on the fall Conversations is now available at http://provost.illinois.edu/docs/C-CUE_FA13_Report.pdf.  Please take a few minutes to see what your colleagues and classmates aspire to for undergraduate education at Illinois.
When I welcomed participants to these Conversations, I told everyone that we would put their best ideas into action.  To do that, for the spring semester we will appoint five Campus Conversation working groups:
Integrative, Interdisciplinary, and Experiential Curricula
Student Passion and Transformation
Growing the Professional Kernel
An International Campus in a Global World
Education for Society’s Grand Challenges
These groups will recommend initiatives that the campus can undertake in each area.  A steering committee will coordinate the groups, and also review our efforts on Access and Affordability.  More details are available in the report. 
I invite you to nominate colleagues or classmates for these working groups by going to http://go.illinois.edu/CCUENominations.  Self-nominations are also welcome.  Please submit your nominations by Wednesday, February 19. 
Providing a vibrant undergraduate experience is at the heart of our mission as a land-grant institution with global impact, and it is also a pillar of our campus strategic plan.  An Illinois education is already something we can all be proud of. Together we will make it even better.

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, along with many regional universities and municipalities in the Midwest, is dealing with the development of persistent ice conditions due to repeated snow events.
As another round of severe winter weather gets ready to impact Central Illinois, we request that when traveling on campus you take the proper precautions to address the potential for variable conditions. Portions of the campus may remain slick during freezing temperatures.
Facilities & Services crews are putting down salt, sand, and brine in affected locations and will continue to apply a mixture of salt and sand in critical areas such as roads and intersections. Brine is also utilized for the pre-treatment of roads, parking lots, and sidewalks. Building Service Workers will remove snow from facility entrances and spread ice melt on building steps and walkways. Please use caution when walking, biking, or driving on campus as extremely low temperatures can limit the effectiveness of salt and ice melt.
Facilities & Services will work as quickly as practical to expedite removal and keep the campus open and accessible for students, faculty, and staff. In a major snow event, the following university parking lots will be cleared first: http://www.fs.illinois.edu/services/maintenance/snow-removal.  Parking in unplowed lots further complicates and delays snow removal efforts.
If you have questions about snow removal, contact Facilities & Services, 217-333-0340."

As members of the Illinois community, we join the Student Body President, Damani Bolden, in supporting Chancellor Phyllis Wise and reaffirming our commitment to the values of Inclusive Illinois: one campus, many voices and the Diversity Values Statement. http://illinois.edu/emailer/newsletter/47047.html
Inclusive Illinois is about institutionalizing a climate of excellence and inclusiveness at Illinois. It is about the campus community -- faculty, staff, and students -- demonstrating its commitment to valuing and respecting the intersecting identities that we all share. Inclusivity can only be accomplished through respect, positive interactions, developing relationships, education, and the sharing of our voices and perspectives.
As evidence of our commitment, we uphold a standard of conduct and behavior that is consistent with the values of inclusivity. In an environment of inclusivity, there is no place for acts of hatred, intolerance, insensitivity, bigotry, threats of violence, harassment or discrimination.
Through our collective commitment to Inclusive Illinois and the Diversity Values Statement, we hope to create one campus, of many voices, that:
Fosters a generation of new leaders who appreciate the values of diversity and inclusivity to our society;
Forges relationships between and among groups and people of different backgrounds;
Creates an environment accepting of difference, including those based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, physical ability, religion, class, and national origin;
Encourages healthy and civil debate across viewpoints, ideas, and beliefs;
Celebrates what different groups bring to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign;
Educates our campus community on the history and legacy of diverse populations; and
Actively addresses issues of hatred and intolerance when and if they arise on our campus and have the misfortune of impacting our campus community.
We encourage a new commitment to the values of Inclusive Illinois:

This is a time for reflection. Actions and words of some of the members of the University of Illinois have brought disgrace to the institution. The response to an operational decision that kept the Urbana campus open during this week’s cold wave has brought unflattering and unwelcome attention to the University of Illinois. Thoughtless, mean-spirited, racist, and sexist comments by a handful in our community have put our University in the national spotlight for the worst possible reasons. Some might argue that the broad support that poured in after those hateful remarks were posted shows that online communication is self-policing and therefore no more needs to be said. But as an institution of higher education, we have the opportunity -- and the obligation -- to use this unfortunate series of events as a “teachable” moment. No one is entitled to go to the University of Illinois. Every student should think of it as a privilege. The reason students are admitted is because we think they have the potential to contribute to our efforts to mold citizens for our state and our country. We live in a multicultural democracy, and our first objective is not simply to produce great engineers, thoughtful philosophers, or great artists, but rather citizens for our country. We have failed in that effort if we produce students who think that the strongest form of argument is a personal attack.We embrace an open dialogue; in fact, we created structures to support it -- faculty Senates, student governments, and public comment periods at every Board of Trustees meeting. The University is about dialogue and discourse. At the University, the ability to question and disagree with decisions is an accepted right. However, the quality of that discourse is diminished by personal attacks, sexist statements, or racist comments. These have no place in our community. Civil discourse may be defined in many different ways, but we paraphrase the 17th century philosopher John Locke in saying that it means communicating thoughts and ideas by words which support the common good. Our expectation for our University community is that we all engage in civil discourse in our treatment of others. It is not only what is right. It is what the world expects of the University of Illinois. Christopher G. KennedyChairman, University of Illinois Board of TrusteesRobert A. EasterPresident, University of Illinois"

I would like to share a new report (“Identification of Technology Clusters for Economic Development”) recently commissioned by Research Park staff. As you recall, Economic Development emerged from our Visioning Future Excellence initiative as one of six themes the campus community identified as important societal challenges we will face in the next 20-50 years. This was an excellent opportunity for us to partner with the Research Park and with the consulting group they chose to learn how we could capitalize on the strengths of the University and the cities of Champaign and Urbana in collaborative ways to create a vibrant community.
Clearly, improving the quality of life in our community by focusing on learning, discovery, and engagement is our enduring mission. However, this study also makes it clear that as our community grows stronger, our ability to attract and retain outstanding faculty, to build broader collaborative networks, and to build our research infrastructure are also greatly enhanced. The report highlights three areas where the research enterprise of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign offers significant potential to fuel broad, positive economic and social growth in East Central Illinois. These  areas – Data Analysis, Data Management, and Computing; Biomedical and Bioengineering; and Energy – are among our campus strategic initiatives and are identified as likely to drive new opportunities in our region and the State of Illinois.
You can download the entire report here and I hope you will take some time to consider the study and the recommendations. I believe the report is yet another strong indicator of how closely our road to pre-eminence is tied to our success in building a strong and sustainable university-community partnership.

Across the University, a record 78,000-plus students were taught, a great deal of pioneering scholarship important to a myriad of audiences was completed, tens of thousands of patients received life-changing treatment through our hospital and clinics, and the needs of citizens across Illinois were served through countless programs that reach out into literally every corner of our state.Those a just a few of our many successes, all rooted in more than 35,000 faculty, academic and non-academic staff, and graduate assistants who go to work every day on our three campuses and add to our long legacy of excellence through their dedication, passion and vision. My thanks to all of you!Now, turning to the months ahead, there are several important initiatives to be done in my office, including a recently completed a review of University Administration. The review is aimed at containing costs and improving service, and we will continue to regularly monitor our operations in UA and on campuses to steward our resources wisely.Over the past few months, the University and University of Illinois Foundation also have developed an ambitious roadmap focused on systematically increasing the scale and effectiveness of our fundraising efforts. In an era of declining public resources, the role of private philanthropy is increasingly critical to our success as a world-class institution. I am personally committed to doing everything possible to make this effort successful.As we look to the future, it is also crucial that we clearly define the overarching goals of the University – our mission for the 21st century and how to achieve it. The Board of Trustees will begin that conversation in a day-long retreat on Jan. 22, where there will be discussion of strategies for advancing health-related education, research and patient services across the breadth of the three campuses and regional sites of the University. In addition to trustees, participants will include senior leadership from each campus, deans and some faculty members from the University Senates Conference. Another Board retreat is scheduled for July, focusing on strategic direction in the other major areas of University activity.Just three years from now, in 2017, the University will mark the sesquicentennial of its founding. When the time comes, we will celebrate not only a past that has made the University of Illinois a world leader in education and innovation, but also the decisions we are making today that will extend our land-grant mission to serve new generations.
Thank you again for your commitment and loyalty to this great University, and I wish you success in this spring semester.
Sincerely,
Robert A. EasterPresident"

January offers a number of campus programs and events celebrating the cultural history and diversity that have shaped the University of Illinois and the world.
“Honoring the Civil Rights Movement as the Struggle Continues: Empowering the Dream … Make It Your Own” is the theme of this year’s community-wide celebration of the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The calendar of events offers many great ways to honor his work and to reflect on the meaning of freedom for all of us today.
This year’s featured events include keynote addresses by Cheryl Brown Henderson and Dr. Francis Ihejirika; a revisiting of the film “Freedom Riders” hosted by the Department of African American Studies; a panel to discuss the diverse voices and perspectives of Civil Rights issues; and a collaboration of two of our own faculty to create a historical and musical experience of the Civil Rights Movement. And of course, one of the highlights will be the annual Community Celebration featuring Maggie Brown and a host of other local students who are winners of the MLK, Jr. Creative Expressions Contest.
A full list of these opportunities with further information can be found at:
http://www.inclusiveillinois.illinois.edu/mlk/calendar.html
We are fortunate to be part of a campus where the arts and education so easily and beautifully intersect to create new ideas and foster different perspectives. I don’t think we could find a better showcase of the creativity than we’ll see in these upcoming events.
Together, we are honoring an American icon and the legacy he set in motion with his words and his actions. I encourage you all to take part in as many of these programs as you can.
Sincerely,
Phyllis M. WiseChancellor"

UI LABS aligns the greatest resources of industry, academia and government to accelerate innovation and solve grand technological challenges in areas critical to the prosperity of Chicago, Illinois and the Midwest, such as advanced manufacturing, transportation, health care, food + agriculture, energy, and infrastructure. By curating University-Industry partnerships to address grand challenges, UI LABS will enhance Illinois and Chicago’s competitiveness as a global tech hub and destination for talent.Our University boasts a strong track record for developing partnerships with industry that result in real economic impact – including the UI Research Park, BP Energy Biosciences Institute, UIC Innovation Center, Abbott Center for Nutrition, Learning and Memory, among others. These close industry relationships and entrepreneurial culture – coupled with our mission of economic development – position us to play a leadership role in the creation of UI LABS. We believe that the federal government’s investment in research centers or hubs of excellence – like the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation – is necessary for our nation’s competitiveness, and the University of Illinois has long demonstrated its commitment to public-private partnerships to advance innovative technologies during the financially challenging early years of a startup. One recent example is the University’s support and investment in the launch the Illinois Manufacturing Lab at UI LABS in collaboration with the State of Illinois to aid small and mid-sized manufacturers in our state and advance our mission of economic development. Through UI LABS, the University is well positioned for the evolution in federal funding. New large-scale federal funding opportunities on the horizon will require broad industry engagement and multi-institutional cooperation, which will be facilitated by UI LABS.UI LABS coordinates the resources and talent of the University of Illinois and other educational institutions in technology, engineering, math, computing and information sciences, and other sciences with the resources and needs of government and industry. Through realizing the benefits of such coordination, UI LABS serves the needs of government and industry to solve society’s biggest technology challenges and promote economic development, while also developing and enhancing the resources and talent of the University of Illinois and other participating educational institutions.UI LABS brings the assets of the University side by side with industry to address grand challenges. It focuses on leveraging existing assets of world-class institutions like the University of Illinois, including our top-ranked engineering and computer science programs that currently train more students than the other top programs combined. Not only does UI LABS intend to grow the number of undergraduate and graduate students training in high-tech disciplines, but it also aims to better connect the existing base of students to local industry and startup opportunities.Numerous faculty have contributed to the conceptualization and planning of UI LABS. Applying the best features of historic and existing research enterprises, such as Bell Laboratories, Stanford Research Institute, and Xerox PARC, UI LABS aims to create a unique enterprise. In many ways, it aspires to be the “Bell Labs of the 21st century,” involving the University of Illinois and other educational institutions, industry, and government in a mix of interdisciplinary, theme-based partnerships to address grand challenges facing society. The nature of its thematic research and training programs will revitalize the spirit of institutions like Bell Labs, which embraced innovation as an interdisciplinary process linking technical challenges with industrial and government goals to enhance competitiveness.Sincerely,Christopher G.

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will resume normal operations tonight at 11. Employees are expected to make every reasonable effort to report for work.
Employees who do not work must use personal time (vacation, floating holiday, accrued compensatory time) or take an excused, unpaid absence.
I want to take this opportunity to thank you for your understanding throughout this weather emergency. I understand that instructing you to stay away from work can create a hardship for some employees. Please know that we have worked hard to provide a generous benefit package of vacation, holidays, sick and personal leave time well above the Big Ten average. Vacation and floating holidays provide for situations such as the one we faced this week.
We made the decision to limit campus operations, because despite the efforts to clear the campus, the community, county and state roads of the snow, the blowing wind and frigid temperatures made it unsafe to maintain normal operations.
Today, the Facilities and Services team continues working to clear streets, parking lots and sidewalks across campus. They expect to have that work substantially completed by the start of the work day tomorrow (Tuesday, Jan. 7). For information on parking options while lots are being cleared, go to: http://www.fs.illinois.edu/services/maintenance/snow-removal
To all of the employees who have been working to clear the snow and keep vital services in operation during the emergency, I offer my deepest thanks.

Congratulations on the end of another successful semester! As final exams are now underway, we wish you the best of luck and want to update you on the hard work your student government has done for you.This Fall, the Illinois Student Senate considered over 40 resolutions, all of which improved student life in various ways. Most notably was our push to bring awareness to the growing amount of student debt within our country through our Student Debt Awareness Week. We have continued to work on expanding our iRent Program that provides iClickers at no cost to students each semester. As well as established the Illinois Student Senate New Members Development Program, which is a hands-on leadership program open to all students.  Additionally, we sponsored several initiatives, and sometimes partnered with other campus and University student organizations and departments in doing so. We are proud to note, that the Illinois Student Senate continued its relationship with the Illini Union Board to provide students with fun and engaging activities unique to the Illinois experience. Furthermore, we allocated funds to Facilities and Services to renovate 1.2 miles of campus bike lanes. We also launched our “Tap That” campaign this semester in partnership with the Student Sustainability Committee to equip campus drinking fountains with water bottle filling nozzles.  Finally, the Illinois Student Senate advanced the students’ legislative agenda at the state capitol in Springfield by advocating for House Bill 2341 in partnership with State Representative Naomi Jakbosson. If passed, the bill will provide Good Samaritan protection to alcohol related incidents on college campuses and throughout Illinois.Though there is always more to be done, take pride in knowing your Student Senate is hard at work for you, and we are excited about doing more for you in the semester to come. If we can ever be of assistance to you please feel free to drop by our offices located within 253 Illini Union or by directly emailing your Student Senator at http://www.iss.illinois.edu/senatorsold.asp. Have a wonderful Winter Break and a Happy Holiday Season!

Gov. Quinn has signed the pension reform bill into law. The law raises many questions for every member of the campus community, current and retired. Unfortunately, the timing and the surprisingly fast progression from legislative introduction to final passage have made it difficult to find quick, clear answers. We understand the anxiety and concern this legislation is causing; as you know, we opposed the reform bill. However, the Legislature needed to take some type of action to protect the state’s financial future and its ability to fund pensions in the future. This was the course they chose.  One of our highest priorities going forward is ensuring that our benefits remain competitive among our peers throughout the nation. With that goal firmly in mind, please know that the campus is working with the university administration to explore a variety of supplemental programs and other options to mitigate the impact of this law on the financial future of our campus community. The earliest the pension changes could take effect is the summer of 2014. We expect that the State University Retirement System (SURS) will release more information within the next few weeks. Until then, we are working to understand the full implications of these changes and to develop solutions to alleviate them. We will share with you, at the earliest possible moment, what we know and what we propose to do. We encourage you to wait for accurate information from SURS and the university before making personal decisions based on the adjustments to the pension system. We believe that working together, we can and will find a way forward that is fiscally sustainable for the institution and that will keep the best and brightest faculty and staff members at Illinois.

Campus snow removal is a carefully planned, cooperative effort involving multiple F&S departments and the cities of Champaign and Urbana. This includes the application of brine to streets, parking lots, and sidewalks to help assist with melting snow and ice. All crews will work as quickly as possible to expedite removal.   
If assigned parking areas have yet to be plowed following a winter storm, please use the designated emergency lots and Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District (MTD) service (For a list of emergency parking lots see: http://www.fs.illinois.edu/services/maintenance/snow-removal). Please do not park in unplowed lots as it further complicates and delays snow removal efforts.
Your patience and cooperation are appreciated while crews do their best to clear snow. If you have questions about snow removal, contact the F&S Service Office, 217-333-0340."

Dear Colleagues,
As expected, the Illinois General Assembly on Tuesday narrowly passed a legislative overhaul of the state’s public pension systems, including the State Universities Retirement System (SURS), and the governor has promised a speedy signing of the new law.
A summary of the legislation was posted by SURS (http://www.surs.com/pdfs/legal/Pension-Reform-Summary-SB1.pdf) on Wednesday. It is likely to be challenged in court as unconstitutional and the judicial process could result in continued uncertainty about the timing and full impact of the changes.
The changes made to reduce the cost of the pension systems to the state and fully fund them within 30 years falls, to a large extent, on employees and retirees, including those of us at the University of Illinois. We are keenly aware of the negative impact of these changes for all of us in the university community and are committed to maintaining a competitive retirement program. To this end we are exploring potential options including a supplemental retirement plan offered by the University. We expect to be able to provide additional information in time for the Board of Trustees meeting in January.
In the meantime, we urge you to follow information provided by SURS and the State Universities Annuitants Association (SUAA) (http://www.suaa.org/).

We are writing with an update on our campus activities with MOOCs – Massive Open Online Courses. 
As you know, Illinois partnered with Coursera beginning in summer 2012 to offer MOOCs developed by our own faculty.  These courses have attracted more than 300,000 people so far, spreading the Illinois reputation for excellence around the globe.  Our MOOC activities have taught us a great deal about teaching and learning, and we continue to study the data from our course-takers.  We have used videos and online materials from our MOOCs to enhance our regular online and on-campus courses.  A second round of Illinois MOOCs is in the production pipeline and will start rolling out in January. 
To help our campus chart a course forward in this rapidly changing environment, last April we appointed a MOOC Strategy Advisory Committee.  This group of faculty leaders and online education experts has issued an interim report, which we want to share with all of you.  The report, now available at http://mooc.illinois.edu, discusses both policy and strategy issues.  You can also find a short news article at http://news.illinois.edu/ii/13/1121/mooc.html.  The advisory committee will continue its work through the semester. 
We are also pleased to announce a new Request for Proposals for faculty who would like to teach a MOOC on the Coursera platform.  First-round proposals will be due on January 21, 2014.  The full RFP is available at http://mooc.illinois.edu/faculty, along with other resources for interested faculty.
We are hopeful that our work with MOOCs will expand our reach as a pre-eminent public research university with a land-grant mission and global impact.  Please visit http://mooc.illinois.edu for updates and more information.

Dear Colleagues,
Members of the Illinois General Assembly as soon as tomorrow are expected to consider, and approve, a major overhaul of the state’s public sector pension systems—changes that as proposed would adversely impact public university employees, place higher education in Illinois at a competitive disadvantage, and ultimately weaken the state’s economy.
For these reasons, the University of Illinois is officially opposing the legislation and we are profoundly disappointed that in nearly three years of engaging the legislative process on this crucial issue, the state’s nine public universities’ counterproposals will not be included.
Details of the final legislative proposal (http://capitolfax.com/DRAFTSB1PensionProposal.PDF) have only just emerged; if passed, the governor has said he will sign it into law, and it is virtually certain to face a constitutional challenge in the courts. The proposed effective date is July 1, 2014. A brief letter from the state’s public universities’ presidents and chancellors expressing their collective opposition went to the legislative leaders and governor today.
In a statement regarding the public pension funding crisis a year ago, the University of Illinois called for a pension system that would be reasonable, responsible, sustainable, and competitive with those offered by our peer institutions.
In our view, the legislation under consideration fails to meet those basic principles. The likely changes arguably lessen the retirement commitments made to employees and retirees, and their net effect also will harm the public higher education sector in Illinois. We will make our opposition heard and monitor the pending legislation and will keep you informed of developments.
Sincerely,  
Robert A. Easter, President, University of IllinoisPhyllis Wise, Chancellor, University of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignPaula Allen-Meares, Chancellor, University of Illinois at ChicagoSusan Koch, Chancellor, University of Illinois at Springfield"

As you have probably heard, state lawmakers have reached a tentative agreement on a pension reform bill, and they are expected to vote on it this week. As President Easter told you last week, our analysts continue to examine the impact of the bill on our faculty and staff and to determine the longer term implications for the entire Illinois family. The campus administration will continue to work with President Easter to ensure that we remain competitive in hiring and retaining the very best faculty and staff.
We will share updated information with you as this process unfolds.

As we enter a season of Thanksgiving and holiday cheer, it gives me no pleasure to update you on what are expected to be proposed changes in the state’s public pension systems that the Illinois General Assembly may consider when it meets next week.
Although a conference committee and the legislative leaders have played it close to the vest in closed-door meetings on how to address the state’s pension funding crisis, information from reliable sources indicates the package that may emerge in Springfield on Dec. 3 would be onerous for public employees, including those of us at the University of Illinois. The proposals, which have not been publicly issued in the form of a bill lawmakers will be asked to consider, would affect current employees and retirees and would be effective July 1, 2014.
Among the anticipated changes to be considered are these:
C.O.L.A.—The automatic, compounded annual 3 percent increase in retirement annuities would be replaced by an annual increase equal to one-half of the increase in the consumer price index, but shall be no less than 1 percent and shall not be greater than 4 percent (a cap in the event of high inflation). Automatic annual increases received prior to the expected July 1, 2014, effective date of the legislation would not be diminished. For employees not yet retired, the C.O.L.A. would be increased biennially for a period of time based on age.
Pensionable earnings limitations—A cap would be placed on pensionable earnings based on the Social Security wage limit, and those currently receiving earnings in excess of that amount would have their pensionable earnings limited to essentially their current salary. In other words, for them future salary increases would not be counted toward pensionable earnings. For employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, the pensionable earnings limit would be applied based on the next collective agreement after the new pension law takes effect.
Other provisions expected to emerge next week include: a reduction in employee contributions for Tier I participants by 1 percent of earnings; a reduction of the “effective rate of interest,” used for money purchase calculations; and a stronger legal requirements that the state adhere to a funding schedule to eliminate the unfunded pension liability within 30 years.   
For the nearly three years now that the pension funding crisis has held center stage in Springfield, a team of University of Illinois advocates, including me, and our counterparts at other Illinois public universities have worked with lawmakers to consider a range of options for solving the pension funding crisis and mitigating its impact on our employees, who are victims and not the cause of the funding shortfall. We will continue to do so in the coming week, and then we will analyze the impact of whatever emerges. I know that many of our employees and retirees have been in touch with legislators, too, and will continue to make themselves heard—on their own time—in the coming weeks.
We will keep you updated in as timely a manner as we can, and following media reports is a good way to stay abreast of developments. I thank you for your dedicated service to the University of Illinois.
Sincerely,
Robert A. EasterPresident"

On November 21, 2013, at approximately 6:28 PM the victim was returning to his apartment at 510 E. Stoughton St., Champaign when two males approached him. Offender #1 placed his hand over the victim’s mouth and placed a silver pistol against his rib cage. He then told the victim to empty his pockets and grabbed the victim’s backpack. Offender #1 then ordered the victim to open his apartment and both offenders entered. Both offenders then ran out of the apartment and fled in an unknown direction.
OFFENDER DESCRIPTION:
Offender #1
The victim described Offender #1 as a dark skinned black male in his early 20’s, approximately 6 feet tall, average build, and “low” voice. He was last seen wearing all black clothing with a black bandana covering his face.

2013-11-19T08:11:00Z,2013-11-19,8:11,64833,Smoke-free Campus,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/26974.html,"Dear Colleagues:
In order to promote a healthy living, learning, and working environment, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will become smoke-free beginning January 1, 2014. The new policy will apply to everyone – students, faculty, staff and visitors. It will include all forms of burning tobacco, including cigarettes, cigars, pipes, hookahs, cigarillos. It will ban smoking on all campus-owned property – indoors and outdoors, as well as the use of e-cigarettes on campus-owned property and smoking in private vehicles parked on campus-owned property.
To help faculty, staff and students adapt to the new policy, the campus will continue offering a variety of tobacco-cessation programs through McKinley Health Center and the UI Wellness Center. In addition, nicotine-replacement products will be sold at many campus locations, including the Illini Union, State Farm Center, the Activities and Recreation Center, Campus Recreation East, the Ice Arena and some residence facilities after January 1.
On Thursday (November 21), the campus will observe the Great American Smoke-Out. Four smoke-free stations will be located across campus. Faculty, staff and students can pick up quit kits, talk with cessation experts, and learn about the smoke-free policy. For more information about this and other smoke-free resources, visit http://go.illinois.edu/smokefree.
The campus is implementing its smoke-free policy to protect the campus community from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke has been determined unsafe at any level. In addition to the long-term effects of secondhand smoke exposure, many nonsmokers exposed to outdoor tobacco smoke suffer immediate symptoms such as breathing difficulties, eye irritation, headaches and nausea.
I ask everyone to respect our new policy to create a healthful environment for all members of our community.
Sincerely,
Phyllis M. WiseChancellor"

We're in the final days of the 2013 Campus Charitable Fund Drive. While the officially-designated donation period has ended, we will continue to accept contributions through Wednesday, November 27. You still have time to make a difference with your donation.
To contribute go to http://www.ccfd.illinois.edu, click on the ""Donate Here"" button and follow the easy steps. It is simple and quick to make a gift that will have an impact all year long.
For everyone who has given this year, I want to thank you for your generosity. I'm always amazed at what can happen when the Illinois family bands together for a cause.
This year's drive has been immensely successful but we are still short of our ambitious $1.4 million dollar goal. I hope you will consider adding your name to the long list of our 2013 donors and help us reach that target in these final days.
And I hope we all remember that this project is really all about the positive impact we can have here in our own community. More than merely meeting goals and figures, we have a real opportunity to change both the lives of our neighbors and our own.
Your donation might help a victim of domestic abuse escape to a safe home, or to feed a hungry child or awaken the love of reading in a struggling student. And that's the most exciting thing about the Campus Charitable Fund Drive – you never know just how your gift might touch a life.
Time and again I have witnessed how a small act of generosity by one person can effect a big change in the lives of many. What we do really matters and your gift makes a difference.
With gratitude,
Phyllis M. Wise Chancellor"

To:  All Faculty
From:  Peter Schiffer, Vice Chancellor for Research
Subject:  Annual Message on Research Integrity Policies
Integrity is at the core of all of our research activities, and this e-mail is the annual reminder of University policies regarding our research integrity obligations and responsibilities. Almost every sponsor of research activity requires that all faculty, staff, and students engaged in sponsored research be informed regularly about campus policies on research integrity, so please share this message with all members of your research teams – including both staff and students.
The University-wide procedures for addressing particular instances of unethical conduct in research and publication are available on the Web at:
           http://www.vpaa.uillinois.edu/Policies/integrityresearch/index.cfm  
Under this Policy, all members of the University community are expected to observe high standards of academic integrity and ethical behavior in research and publication. Any practice or conduct by a member of the University community that seriously deviates from those ethical standards for proposing, conducting, and publishing research that are commonly accepted within the professional community constitutes academic misconduct in violation of University Policy.
Research misconduct includes, but is not limited to, fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results:
- Fabrication is making up data or results and recording or reporting them.
- Falsification is manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record.
- Plagiarism is the appropriation of another person’s ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit.
Other examples of research misconduct include:
- Intentionally misleading or deliberately false reporting of credentials and related information;
- Abuse of confidentiality with respect to unpublished materials;
- Misappropriation of research materials;
- Evasion, or intentional failure to comply after notice with research regulations, such as those governing conflict of interest/commitment, human subjects, laboratory animals, new drugs, radioactive materials, genetically altered organisms, and safety;
- Any other conduct that constitutes a serious deviation from accepted ethical guidelines and professional standards in scholarship and research.
Note that honest errors or differences of opinion are not considered research misconduct.

2013-10-22T05:04:00Z,2013-10-22,5:4,11026,Your Obligations to Ensure Research Safety,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/26952.html,"Dear Colleagues:
All University faculty and academic professionals involved in our research enterprise have a responsibility to provide for the safety of our students and employees.   We are writing to remind everyone of our obligations – both legal and ethical – to ensure that we all work and learn in the safest possible environment. Recent incidents at several universities have revealed a general lack of safety awareness and enforced safety standards in academia. It is important that we understand our personal responsibilities for workplace safety and are aware of campus resources to help us meet them.
As a faculty member or principal investigator for a research program, you are responsible for promoting safety and ensuring regulatory compliance in your research area (see http://cam.illinois.edu/ for details). To fulfill this responsibility, you must:
1.   Keep laboratory, experimental, or other workspaces assigned to you safe.   Biological, chemical, and radiological hazards should be identified and safely managed in compliance with regulatory requirements. Safe work practices that eliminate or effectively reduce the risk for exposure to harmful substances should be developed and established. Inspect assigned space for mechanical, electrical, environmental or other hazards and promptly address all unsafe conditions. The Division of Research Safety and the Division of Safety and Compliance can provide guidance and assistance to you in identifying, assessing, and mitigating hazards.
2.   Provide and document appropriate safety and health training for students and employees under your direction or supervision. Guidance on training requirements is available at http://www.drs.illinois.edu/training/. Be sure that everyone who works in your laboratory completes the online General Laboratory Safety course, and remember that alternative or additional training may be necessary, depending on the individual’s specific duties. All training should be documented.
3.   Provide appropriate personal protective equipment to students and employees under your direction or supervision. Review and monitor use of proper personal protective equipment. If you have a laboratory, verify that you have a lab-specific Chemical Hygiene Plan, which is required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). A template is available at http://www.drs.illinois.edu/css/guidesplans/chyp/. Chemical hazards outside of a laboratory require that you have a Hazard Communication plan http://www.drs.illinois.edu/css/guidesplans/hazcom/index.aspx.
4.   Be sure that people and activities under your direction comply with all applicable federal, state and campus regulations.
The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research (OVCR) and Facilities and Services provide a number of safety resources that are listed below. Furthermore, many campus units have knowledgeable safety groups or committees. In particular, unit safety offices and their directors can help guide you, working with you to coordinate interactions with the various campus-level safety groups identified here.
Please periodically review safety issues with your students and employees, and if you have comments or concerns, please feel free to contact Jan Novakofski in OVCR (jnova@illinois.edu), Peter Ashbrook, in the Division of Research Safety (peteash@illinois.edu), or Maureen Banks in the Division of Safety and Compliance (maubanks@illinois.edu).
Sincerely,
Peter Schiffer, Vice Chancellor for Research
Allan Stratman, Executive Director of Facilities

As you may have heard, a traffic accident yesterday in Urbana killed a student and injured another. In these terrible situations, we normally reach out directly to the people who have been closest to the tragedy, to offer support and assistance. However, this accident happened on a busy street when many people were walking to and from classes. Because we cannot determine who might benefit from our services now, I am reaching out to ensure that everyone knows where to find counselors.
Our Counseling Center staff members are available for walk-in emergency consultations whenever students need them. Students can go to the Counseling Center at 610 East John Street, Champaign, during business hours, or they can call them at 333-3704. After hours, they can reach out to us at 359-4141.

As chancellor, it is my responsibility to annually reaffirm our campus commitment to equal opportunity, affirmative action, and equal access. This commitment is consistent with my unwavering belief that diversity, as part of a living, learning, and working community, is a cornerstone of excellence and a strategic imperative for us all in our effort to be a pre-eminent public research university with a land-grant mission and global impact.
The campus, as reflected by Inclusive Illinois, is committed to creating and maintaining a community that recognizes and values the inherent worth and dignity of every person, while fostering an environment of mutual respect among its members. The campus takes seriously our responsibility to provide leadership in ensuring that equal employment opportunity, affirmative action, and equal access is our standard practice rather than an aspiration. As such, university policy prohibits discrimination or harassment of any member of the campus community during any stage of the employment process. This includes recruitment, selection, promotion, transfer, merit increases, salary, training and development, demotion, and separation on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, order of protection status, genetic information, marital status, disability, sexual orientation including gender identity and unfavorable discharge from the military or status as a protected veteran. In addition, our affirmative action plan requires the campus to undertake good faith efforts to achieve the university's affirmative action goals for women, minorities, persons with disabilities, and protected veterans. 
The Office of Diversity, Equity, and Access (www.diversity.illinois.edu) is a resource for the campus and is available to address any campus concerns involving these matters. Realizing our shared vision of an Inclusive Illinois requires that we all annually reaffirm our individual commitment to building a truly diverse, welcoming, and inclusive community of students, scholars and staff.

Robbery #1
On September 13, 2013, at approximately 1:00 AM the victim was walking on the sidewalk near 105 E. Daniel St., Champaign when two males approached her.

Male #1 is described as white, wearing a light colored shirt and khaki shorts. Male #2 is described as black, wearing a navy blue shirt and khaki shorts.
Robbery #2
On September 13, 2013, at approximately 1:40 AM the victim was walking near the intersection of Third St. and Daniel St., Champaign when two males, she did not know, approached her and asked if she needed someone to walk her home.   The two males told her it was not safe for her to walk alone so she allowed them to walk with her. As they were walking through the St. John’s Catholic Newman Center parking lot (1005 S. Fifth St., Champaign), Male #1 pushed the victim to the ground. He then grabbed the victim’s purse and wrestled it away from her. The two males ran westbound and were last seen at Chalmers St. and Fourth St., Champaign.

Today marks the 50th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. This speech and that historic March on Washington in 1963 are truly defining moments in our nation’s history. Indeed, a number of our own campus and community members experienced in person those remarkable moments on the National Mall. For many, that speech and the events that inspired it were a turning point for civil rights and social equality in this country. But there is also an open and continuing debate about how far we have come on the road to realizing the dream Dr. King so brilliantly etched into our national memory. It is a debate we see nationally, regionally, and even here locally. 
At Illinois, a public university founded on the promise of educational access and opportunity, we may debate how far we’ve come and how far we have to go. But we can all share the goal of a community where diverse perspectives and backgrounds are all welcome and where all ideas have a place in the discussion.
For us, excellence is tied inextricably to diversity. When people on our campus are more diverse, the conversations in the classroom, in the lab, in the studio, and in the residence hall are richer and the solutions are better. This is reflected institutionally in our Diversity Values Statement adopted last year by the Academic Senate and it can be found in our Inclusive Illinois: one campus, many voices initiative.
Dr. King’s words are so eloquent and moving it is no wonder that even those of us who have heard them many times are still so awed by them.
And while none of us may match that eloquence, we can all understand his message.
Together, all together, we are simply a better university and a better community.

Since August 23, 2013, the department has received six robbery reports; three involved handguns. Detectives are currently investigating these crimes to determine if any are related. The robberies occurred between the hours of 9:30 PM and 3:00 AM and in the following areas:
Green and Neil Streets
Second and Daniel Streets
300 block of E. Springfield Avenue
400 block of S. Second Street
500 block of E. Stoughton
700 block of W. Church Street
The Champaign Police Department is currently searching for a suspect in connection with the armed robbery that occurred today at 12:30 AM, in the 500 block of E. Stoughton Street. A 25 year-old male reported locking up his bicycle at a bicycle rack in the area, when two males approached him. One of the males placed the barrel of a gun to the victim’s forehead and demanded his property. The victim refused, but later turned over cash to the suspect.
The suspect then struck the victim in the head with the gun, which caused him to fall to the ground. Later, a University of Illinois police officer found the victim lying on the ground unconscious and bleeding. He was transported to a local hospital for treatment of injuries sustained during the robbery. At the hospital, the victim reported to police that he was also missing a laptop computer, credit cards and other personal items. The armed suspect was described as a black male, approximately 5’7” tall; no additional descriptions were provided to police.
In response to the robberies, the Champaign and University of Illinois Police Departments have increased patrols in and around the campus area, to include plain clothes police officers. The public is reminded to remain alert, especially when walking alone; it is best to travel in pairs. Refrain from being distracted by cell phones or other electronic devices; two of the victims reported talking on a cell phone or using headphones when they were approached. Always travel in well-lit areas, when possible.
The public is urged to contact law enforcement with any information. Information can be reported to the Champaign Police Department by calling (217) 351-4545, or callers can remain anonymous by calling Crime Stoppers at 373-8477 (TIPS).

2013-08-23T10:10:00Z,2013-08-23,10:10,64347,Fall Welcome,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/26887.html,"August 23, 2013
 
As we look ahead to a new academic year, I also want to reflect on the state of the University – our strengths and successes, our challenges and our future.
From my vantage point, the University of Illinois stands rock solid, globally respected and deeply committed to its historical missions of teaching, research and service. The University and its three campuses are forward-looking, resilient and prepared to overcome the challenges we face in both the short and long term. And we are poised to build on a nearly 150-year legacy of excellence that has made the U of I a world leader in education and innovation.
My confidence is firmly grounded in our people – talented, hard-working faculty and staff who are unquestionably among the best in world; dedicated, visionary leadership on our campuses and on our Board of Trustees; and loyal, generous alumni and supporters. They share an unwavering commitment to the University’s success, and I am privileged to work with them.
Together, we face challenges that are well known. The state of Illinois struggles to provide the funding needed to both operate the University and to provide pension and health benefits for employees. Though overall support has declined significantly over the last 30 years, it is important to remember that the citizens of Illinois remain generous partners, providing about $669 million in operating funds for fiscal year 2014 and more than $1 billion to cover benefit costs – or a third of our $5.6 billion budget.
Over the last decade, we have plugged the gap through steep increases that have more than doubled annual tuition costs. In fiscal year 2014, tuition revenue will contribute more than $1 billion to the University’s budget, about $396 million more than our state appropriation.
Those dollars have been critical to support our world-class academic and research programs, along with the costs of major remodeling and building maintenance projects that were once funded by the state through capital appropriations. In fiscal year 2014, those bricks-and-mortar costs will total more than $35 million.
But substantial tuition increases threaten student access – a core of our land-grant mission – and simply cannot continue. As a result, the Board of Trustees adopted a policy three years ago that seeks to hold tuition increases to the rate of inflation, and the 1.7 percent increase for incoming freshman this fall is the smallest in nearly two decades.
The policy is essential to ensure that students have the opportunity to achieve their dreams, but it will curtail a crucial revenue stream as new financial pressures loom. While a solution to the state's pension crisis has yet to be reached, the U of I and other public universities in Illinois have agreed to directly absorb over time the employer’s portion of employee normal payroll retirement costs, a move that could add up to $200 million to the University’s expenses if adopted.
Through careful stewardship of our resources, I believe we can sustain the excellence that has made the University of Illinois one of the world’s premier public research institutions. It will require a renewed focus on private giving and a continued push for our fair share of state and federal funding. And it will require sacrifice, tough decisions and an ongoing review of our priorities, programs and operations.
One of those in-house assessments is currently nearing completion. Last year, I authorized a review of all units in University Administration to ensure they are operating efficiently and serving the needs of our campuses.
Along with finances, the University also faces other challenges. The paradigm of higher education is changing, a byproduct of rising tuition, new technology and increasing competition. Today, more students are using community colleges as a less-expensive gateway to degrees. The higher education landscape is also growing, with the rise of online education and a fourfold increase of private, for-profit colleges since 1990.
In the face of those pressures, are the University of Illinois' best days behind it? I wouldn't be here if I thought so.
The promise of our future rests on the same firm foundation that built our past – the scholarship of our faculty and staff, and their unending push to expand the boundaries of knowledge and innovation.
They are the cornerstone of highly ranked academic programs that continue to attract students in record numbers and of a nearly $1 billion research portfolio that includes a U of I record $813 million in federal funding, which ranks sixth best among university systems nationwide.
Their teaching transforms lives, producing the highly skilled graduates who are so critical in today's rapidly changing, increasingly global workplace. Their groundbreaking research fosters progress and economic growth, advancing humankind and creating new jobs in fields that were once unimaginable.
As I consider the challenges we face, I am reminded of President Abraham Lincoln's inaugural State of the Union address, delivered on the brink of a Civil War that threatened to divide our nation. ""The struggle of today is not altogether for today,"" he said, ""it is for a vast future also.""
So it is for all of us. The decisions we make now will define the future of both the University of Illinois and its life-changing impact on our students, our state and our nation. If we are as nimble and creative as our history suggests we can be, I have every expectation that the best days for the University of Illinois are still to come.
The road we take to get there won't be guided by a single person at the top with a great vision. Instead, it will be the work of thousands – faculty, staff, alumni and supporters who share their expertise, creativity and love of the University to ensure that its greatness never wanes.
In the end, we may look different and we might go about our work differently. But we will hold true to the core of our mission – discovery, transferring knowledge, transforming lives and leading the way to progress and prosperity.
Thank you for your dedication and loyalty to the University of Illinois, and I wish you all the best in the year to come.
Sincerely,
Robert A. EasterPresident"

2013-06-21T13:04:00Z,2013-06-21,13:4,15139,Testimony in support of six-step pension plan,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/26855.html,"June 21, 2013Dear Colleagues,The Illinois General Assembly reconvened in a special session this week to deal with the state's public pensions funding crisis, and a plan unanimously endorsed by presidents and chancellors of the public universities appeared to get some traction at a Senate hearing in Springfield.Cost savings in the universities' ""Six-Step Plan"" (http://igpa.uillinois.edu/node/1814) reduce the unfunded pension liability of the State Universities Retirement System (SURS), which covers public university and community college employees, achieving a 100 percent funding ratio by 2044. Since SURS represents nearly one-quarter of the state's total unfunded pension liability of approximately $97 billion, the plan represents a significant step if taken alone, or as a model for the other pension systems as well.Key features of the plan include: a cost shift from the state to the universities and colleges, phased in at one-half of 1 percent-per-year; a 2 percent increase in pension contributions by Tier 1 employees (those hired before Jan. 1, 2011), phased in at one-half of 1 percent per year; a compounded cost-of-living allowance (COLA) of one-half of the consumer price index (CPI) for annuitants to cope with inflation; and a new defined benefit/defined contribution hybrid plan for new employees (hired after the law goes into effect), with no additional cost to the state. It also calls for revisions in state procurement; hiring and inventory controls to optimize operational efficiencies; measures to ensure enforcement of state and employer funding; and university representation on the SURS board.Importantly, an analysis by SURS indicates this plan can achieve approximately the same cost savings as other plans being considered, most of which include rather severe benefit reductions: a cap on pensionable income; no compounding of COLA, or a choice between COLA and state-funded health care; and a higher retirement age, to name a few. Furthermore, the Six-Step Plan is a strong contender to withstand the constitutional test that pension benefits ""shall not be diminished or impaired.""Although there is not universal agreement across our campuses, the plan has been endorsed by U of I annuitants groups. Our university senates conference has sympathetically reviewed the plan and supports the effort of establishing a sustainable pension system that will allow colleges and universities to stay competitive in the recruitment and retention of faculty and staff.As I testified to the Senate Executive Committee, the simple reality is that the pension funding crisis has reached the point when action must be taken, and the public universities' plan is the best alternative to get the job done for our people and the state of Illinois. I was joined at the hearing by the presidents of Governor's State, Northern Illinois, and Southern Illinois universities. Also there to endorse it was the community colleges trustees' organization. We were gratified by the welcoming response to the Six-Step Plan by several senators on both sides of the aisle. Although the questioning was incisive and all of the more severe options remain on the table, the lawmakers were receptive to elements of our plan. Senate President John Cullerton noted that resolving the state's $100 billion pension underfunding problem would free up state revenue to increase the appropriations to public universities, reducing the pressure to raise tuition. A legislative conference committee was empaneled to review the competing plans for funding Illinois' public pension systems and develop a compromise bill capable of winning approval. The Six-Step Plan endorsed by the state's public universities is a good starting point for the pension conferees, and we will work through the summer to monitor its progress.       Sincerely,Robert A. EasterPresident, University of Illinois"

2013-06-05T05:04:00Z,2013-06-05,5:4,15108,End of legislative session update,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/26844.html,"June 5, 2013Dear Colleagues,The spring legislative session of the Illinois General Assembly wrapped up last Friday evening, and the outcomes were decidedly mixed.  On one hand, lawmakers kept the upcoming fiscal 2014 appropriation for public universities at current levels, averting a proposed cut. On the other, they couldn't agree on a plan for revamping Illinois' underfunded public pensions systems, an issue of critical importance to all of us and to the state.And while the legislature made changes in Medicaid provisions that should help the University's hospital and health care system and exempted our campuses from a law that permits the concealed carry of firearms, time expired before final consideration of our negotiated changes to procurement reform and to regulations for re-employment of retirees.It remains to be seen whether the governor and legislative leaders will call a special summer session to act on ''unfinished business,'' or wait until the regular fall session in November. Gov. Pat Quinn, who had proposed a 5 percent ($32 million) reduction in the fiscal 2014 U of I appropriation, has the summer to deliberate on the budget approved by legislators and whether he will make amendatory vetoes to it.The appropriation of approximately $664 million for the fiscal year beginning July 1 marks the first time in three years that direct state revenue support for the University wasn't cut. This outcome reflects a unified voice among public universities in Illinois and advocacy by the U of I -- including our grassroots Illinois Connection supporters -- to hold the line on state support given financial efficiencies we've made and an increasingly untenable tuition burden on our students. I thank the legislators for recognizing these efforts and continuing our level of funding.Similarly, a core U of I mission -- medical teaching and healthcare for underserved communities -- was a legislative priority that won support. Changes we advocated in Medicaid reimbursement, eligibility and services were approved and should allow our hospital and clinics to better provide preventative services and care to our communities when the Affordable Care Act takes effect.The greatest frustration of the session, of course, was the legislature's failure to solve the benefits-and-funding puzzle for the state's public pension systems, including the State Universities Retirement System (SURS). A responsible and reliable pension system is imperative if we are to recruit and retain the best faculty and staff. Public universities, again, took a united stance in advocating on behalf of what we considered reasonable changes to keep the systems viable, but ultimately neither legislative chamber could agree on the other's approach.  Consequently, changes we negotiated to reduce regulatory red tape in University procurement for research and health care, as well as in implementation of a retiree ''return to work'' law that now will go into effect Aug. 1, were caught up in the pensions logjam and were not voted on by legislators.Our elected officials in Springfield acknowledged that they have work left unfinished. The U of I team will continue to be there with them, providing our expert analysis, information, and advocacy.  Sincerely, Robert A. EasterPresident, University of Illinois"

My new view of our University's three campuses and health-care system has only served to reinforce what I have long known -- that our greatness is rooted in the commitment and excellence of our nearly 23,000 employees. As we close another academic year and prepare for the next, I'm proud to express my deepest thanks to all of you for your dedicated service to our students, to discovery and to our society. You are the foundation behind our ongoing growth in enrollment, in degrees awarded, in student applications, in research funding, and in respect from our peers around the world.Our Board of Trustees and University leadership are committed to recognizing your loyalty and devotion. We will continue our push to support the issues that are most important to you -- funding to advance our world-class programs, a competitive salary program that allows us to recruit and retain top faculty and staff, an equitable and sustainable pension funding scheme, and relief from regulatory red tape that while well-intentioned sometimes becomes counterproductive to our teaching and research missions.Your work is crucial to the social and economic progress of our state and nation. Working together, we will build on our rich legacy of service, and ensure that the University's best days are still to come.Thank you again for everything you do for the University of Illinois.

We are so proud of you. As you commemorate this milestone in your life, we know many of you miss the iconic Alma Mater sculpture as a backdrop for Commencement photographs.With that in mind, we have created several options for you, the most innovative of which is the Augmented Reality Alma Mater. Graduates and guests can have their picture taken with a three-dimensional, life-sized virtual rendering of the Alma Mater sculpture atop its pedestal at the corner of Green and Wright streets from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Thursday, May 9, through Saturday, May 11.Using a special app running on iPads provided at the site, and a target image mounted on the pedestal, you will be able to walk around the front and sides of the virtual sculpture and see it from different perspectives. The rendering was created using high-resolution, three-dimensional surface scans of the physical sculpture at a Chicago-area studio, where conservation work is being performed.This will be the first time anyone will be able to see Alma's new bronze appearance. Participants will be able to view and download pictures online.Wireless access will be available at the site. Signs with links to mobile-friendly videos about the sculpture and project will be present for those waiting to be photographed who wish to learn more about the famous sculpture, conservation efforts, and this project.More information about the Augmented Reality Alma Mater is available at http://go.illinois.edu/aboutalma.Additional Alma photo opportunities include a project by students at the School of Art and Design. They are creating plaster replicas of Alma that will appear at some of the more heavily traveled areas on campus over Commencement weekend, including the Beckman Institute, the Alumni Association building, the Art and Design building, Assembly Hall and the Main Quad. For a map, go to: http://www.fs.uiuc.edu/pdfs/sas/crc/crcnews/photoopps/index.html. Foellinger Auditorium will have bunting added that features school colors, and the Hallene Gateway will have special landscaping added. The Illini Union will have a photo booth with a special backdrop will give graduating students a chance to snap photos with a ''virtual'' Alma on Thursday and Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The Alumni Association will host GradFest on Sunday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., featuring a ''green screen'' Alma background. Members of the 1867 Society will stroll campus wearing Alma, Labor and Learning costumes and will be available to pose for pictures with graduates.We wish you a wonderful Commencement weekend, and we hope you will come back to visit your Alma Mater and the original Alma Mater sculpture many times in the coming years.Best wishes,Chancellor Phyllis WiseProvost Ilesanmi  Adesida"

The University of Illinois will continue to be engaged in the process until work on this issue so critical to our employees is completed.On Thursday, the Illinois House passed a comprehensive pension funding plan sponsored by Speaker Michael Madigan a little more than 24 hours after the nearly 300-page initiative was publicly introduced. It effectively substituted the Madigan plan for provisions of Senate Bill 1, a comprehensive plan sponsored by Senate President John Cullerton and passed by the Senate in April. The competing measures now must be reconciled by both chambers to pass legislation for Gov. Pat Quinn's consideration.The fluidity and uncertainty of the situation in the face of a looming deadline affords an opportunity for renewed consideration of other ideas that have been proposed. Among them is a six-point plan published by the U of I Institute of Government and Public Affairs (IGPA) and championed by all of the state's public universities' presidents and chancellors. The six-point plan this week received an analysis by SURS (the State Universities Retirement System) that concluded it would provide a comparable level of savings as several of the other proposed plans for resolving the pension funding shortfall. It does so without some of the provisions now contained in SB 1, such as the cap on pensionable income.Please see http://go.illinois.edu/PensionUpdate for these documents and communications.We will continue to make the case for our very reasonable and responsible alternative in the coming weeks as the various parties in Springfield seek a workable compromise. The U of I has been engaged in these deliberations since the very beginning''sharing the research and analysis of our experts, testifying at hearings, and meeting face-to-face with legislative leaders and their staff.We understand that to recruit and retain the best people, the University must have a competitive and sustainable compensation and benefits package, including our pension program, and we are advocating to fulfill that objective. I urge you to stay abreast of developments through the media and online resources provided above.Sincerely,Robert A. Easter, President"

2013-04-09T15:05:00Z,2013-04-09,15:5,15250,Pension update: leaders endorse plan,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/26810.html,"April 9, 2013Dear Colleagues,Proposals for addressing the public pension funding crisis in Illinois are expected to take center stage in the Capitol during the next seven weeks, and the presidents and chancellors of the state's 14 public universities have endorsed a six-point plan recently published by the University of Illinois' Institute of Government and Public Affairs (IGPA).This unanimous agreement on how to address the pension crisis as it applies to the State Universities Retirement System (SURS) was conveyed to Gov. Pat Quinn and the four legislative leaders in a letter last week. The chancellors of all three U of I campuses and I signed the letter. 'We look forward to working with you and the others in the General Assembly to translate these ideas into legislation,' the letter said, a reiteration of the presidents' and chancellors' collective willingness to participate in a process toward a solution that is 'financially prudent and consistent with the principles of constitutionality, fairness, and equity.'Proposals for solving the pension funding crisis have advanced in the early stages of the legislative session but the Governor and lawmakers continue to seek a consensus solution. The package of steps described in 'Six Simple Steps: Reforming the Illinois State University Retirement System' is a viable option for SURS, the university presidents and chancellors agreed.The IGPA position paper is online (http://igpa.uillinois.edu/node/1753), as is the letter from the presidents and chancellors (http://go.my.illinois.edu/pensionletter). A summary of current legislative proposals prepared by SURS can be found at http://www.surs.org/pdfs/advocate/legislativeadvocateapril2013.pdf  and http://www.surs.org/legislation.The six points of the plan are as follows:* Change the annual cost of living adjustment (COLA) to link it to the consumer price index.* Rationalize administrative rules for calculating the rate of interest used to determine a range of benefits, refunds and service credits that is set each year by the SURS Board and the State Comptroller.* Over time shift responsibility for paying a portion of the annual pension cost of SURS to universities and colleges.* Increase contributions by Tier I participants from 8 percent to 10 percent of pay over a two-year period in exchange for granting the appropriate legal rights to participants to hold the state accountable for its funding commitments.* Require the state to agree to a schedule of payments to steadily reduce SURS' unfunded liability.  * Replace the Tier II plan for new employees with a new 'hybrid' plan for new employees that combines features of both defined-benefit and defined-contribution programs.In the letter to the governor and legislative leaders we have acknowledged and accepted the additional financial burdens of paying a portion of the normal cost. 'The cost shift will be feasible only if phased in slowly, as recommended in the paper, and made concurrent with a stabilization of general revenue appropriations during the transition,' the letter asserted. 'We also realize that linking cost of living adjustment to the CPI will reduce retiree earnings in the short term. But this change also provides long-term insurance against high inflation, a valuable benefit for participants.'One cannot predict the outcome of the pension funding issue in this legislative session, but I believe the state's public universities throughout the process have contributed reliable information and options that are consistent with principles espoused by the presidents and chancellors. Our desire is that the conversations underway in Springfield result in a pension program for SURS that is sustainable, competitive with the programs offered by our peer public research universities, and provides retirement security for employees and retirees.Sincerely,Bob EasterPresidentUniversity of Illinois"

Instead of sending daily mass mail updates, we will be updating the illinois.edu website accordingly, and we will send any major updates via email to campus as they unfold. The initial phishing attacks caused the University of Illinois to be placed on the blacklists of several email filtering services. Any company or university using these filtering services could not receive email from @illinois.edu addresses while the University of Illinois was blacklisted. As a note, if you do send an email to a company or university that is using an email filtering service that has us currently blacklisted, you will receive notice that your email did not reach its intended destination.The efforts of CITES and email users at the University have yielded successes in getting removed from many of these blacklists. What we are doing to address this serious issue:- CITES has added extra automated reviews of outgoing email to double check that Illinois email accounts are not being used to send spam. As a matter of necessity, these additional reviews of outgoing email can sometimes delay the delivery of messages. Typical delays have not exceeded 30 minutes.- We are contacting users of compromised accounts and requiring them to reset their passwords.What you can do to protect your account:- Change your @illinois.edu email password to improve your account's security and help protect that of others. Passwords can be changed by using the CITES Password Manager located at: http://passwords.cites.illinois.edu- Continue to check the CITES web site for more information about the phishing attacks and the state of our email service. We thank you all for your understanding and your continued efforts to help keep our Illinois account information secure.Sincerely,Greg Gulick, Deputy CIO, University of Illinois, Urbana/Champaign and Executive Director, CITESMike Corn, Chief Security Officer, University of Illinois, Urbana/Champaign"

The relationship calls for adequate communication among these components, and full opportunity for appropriate joint planning and effort."" (http://www.aaup.org/report/1966-statement-government-colleges-and-universities)The Senate of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign is committed to fostering the conditions that make such joint decision-making effective. However, these processes exist not only at the campus and university levels. They are also implemented - and for most faculty most directly experienced - at the department and college levels. Therefore, the Senate is conducting a general survey of shared governance processes within departments and colleges. These questions are loosely adapted from a similar survey developed by the AAUP.This survey is confidential: your identity and that of your department and college are protected.If survey results indicate that further, more detailed inquiry is justified, we recommend that the Senate Executive Committee work with the Office of the Provost to develop a follow-up process that would identify particular units and outline steps for improvement where needed.The survey has ten items and takes only a few minutes to complete. The closing date for submission of a survey is April 26, 2013. Click the following link to begin the survey: https://illinois.edu/sb/sec/664867Thank you for your participation!Matthew B.

In order to help us address the issue, please review the information provided here. Additional information can be found by reading the ""Phishing Alert"" news item on the campus and CITES homepage.In recent weeks there has been an uptick in malicious email attacks that attempt to trick individuals into logging in to malicious websites, thereby collecting their login and password. Some of these ""phishing"" attacks were emails that used University of Illinois branding, lending an air of legitimacy to them.Unfortunately, the attacks were able to use advanced phishing techniques to trick a number of users into revealing their University account information (NetID and password). These compromised accounts are now being used to send more spam and phishing messages, which is negatively impacting normal email communications that the campus relies upon to conduct business. Because of the increased volume of spam and phishing messages sent to off-campus email addresses (e.g. gmail.com, hotmail.com) from compromised Illinois.edu addresses, certain spam control services around the world have blacklisted all email messages that originate from Illinois.edu email servers. This means that emails sent from an Illinois.edu address to schools and companies using these spam control services will not reach their intended recipients.Please be aware that the University of Illinois will never ask you to reply to an email to with your password or to update account information through email.CITES apologizes for the problem and is working on technical solutions to minimize the impact of these phishing scams, but no technical solution is foolproof. It is vital to the University that all university members pay closer attention to potential phishing attacks, particularly fraudulent emails. We are making changes in the email system today that will reduce the impacts of the attacks and will begin to reduce the number of external sites that are blocking university email.For additional information on recognizing phishing emails, what CITES is doing to address this problem and how that might affect your use of email, please visit the campus home page or the CITES website for detailed information.Thank you,Greg Gulick and Mike Corn"

She will also receive the Presidential Award and Medallion in recognition of her life of activism for social justice and her service to humanity.Although she is widely known as the widow of Medgar Evers,Dr. Myrlie Evers is a woman whose sharp intellect, deep commitment, numerous contributions, powerful voice, and shining example have earned her a well-deserved reputation for outstanding national leadership in her own right. Between 1954 and 1963, she worked as a field secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Jim Crow, Mississippi. Among her responsibilities were voter registration drives, civil rights demonstrations, campaigning for the desegregation of the University of Mississippi and Mississippi public schools, advocating for equal access to public accommodations in the wake of the Brown v. Board of Education decision, and educating the everyday citizen of their civic rights and responsibilities.  Following her husband's assassination in June 1963, Dr. Evers continued to engage in social justice endeavors to secure funding and better opportunities for the poor, the homeless, and for organizations such as the National Woman's Educational Fund. She played an active role in the NAACP, including serving as the first woman to chair the organization from 1995 to 1998.  After leaving her post as chairperson for the NAACP,Dr. Evers established the Medgar Evers Institute in Jackson, Mississippi, which continues to promote the values of democracy, freedom, and justice.The culminating event on February 27 includes musical performances by the Black Chorus, the Men's and Women's Glee Clubs, and the Wind Symphony, which will be performing the Lincoln Portrait. There will also be a special commissioned piece in memory of Medgar Evers.  I look forward to seeing you at this important campus celebration.  Sincerely,Phyllis M. WiseChancellor"

Such violations include consuming alcohol as a minor, providing alcohol to minors, damage and destruction of property, dangerous activities such as throwing items from balconies, and acts of physical violence and sexual aggression. The consequences for such violations will be assigned commensurate with the seriousness of the behavior. As a reminder, disciplinary records are subject to review in background checks by graduate schools and future employers. Students may be dismissed as a result of their dangerous behavior and irresponsible choices on Unofficial Saint Patrick's Day.  At the University, students who host guests will be held accountable for negative consequences incurred by their guests, with respect to property damage or threats to others' safety. If a guest or visitor is cited or arrested for illegal activity, the University will forward this information to any college or University where that guest may be enrolled for disciplinary action.  Additionally, there is a new amendment to the law which holds individuals (social hosts) criminally responsible for hosting an event or social gathering (party) where he or she knowingly authorizes or permits a residence which he or she occupies to be used for underage possession or consumption of alcohol.  Violation of the law can lead to being charged with a Class A misdemeanor (which carries up to 364 days in jail and a $2,500 fine) or a Class 4 Felony (which carries up to 3 years in jail and a $25,000 fine). Hosts found serving or allowing minors to possess alcohol or charging admission will be arrested on state charges and transported to the Champaign County Jail.  Given the serious consequences that could occur, we strongly urge you to choose responsible behavior and ask that you look out for the safety of yourselves and others.  Sincerely,C.

Instructors should not need to alter instructional plans.The Student Code http://www.admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/ addresses student responsibilities on campus. Sections 1-102(d) and 1-302(f) concern classroom conduct expectations, and section 1-307 focuses on alcohol consumption. The Code empowers instructors to ask disruptive students to leave class; after class, names of disruptive students should be reported to the Office for Student Conflict Resolution at 333-3680 or online at http://www.conflictresolution.illinois.edu/forms/incidentReport/form.asp.If asking a disruptive student to leave class could escalate into a confrontation, you may seek assistance. From 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on March 1, teams of Student Affairs and Academic Affairs professionals will walk through and around buildings with classrooms and lecture halls where disruptions were experienced in the past. Team members, wearing University IDs, may be summoned to help. Teams will be prepared to document apparent Code violations and to call University police, if necessary.Students will be asked not to bring any liquids into Foellinger Auditorium and Lincoln Hall Theatre. Longstanding policy prohibits liquids and food in these spaces.Students who interfere with the academic mission of the University will face serious consequences. Thank you for reinforcing this message before and on March 1.Office of the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and ProvostOffice of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs"

Such changes include direct elections for the President, Vice-President and Treasurer. Additionally, the Illinois Student Senate is seeking to shift the collection of the government's budget from the administration directly to the Student Body. The Senate, by large margin, approved of these proposals and must now gather signatures from the Student Body in order to place the questions on the ballot. Please note that these are two separate proposals and may be voted upon independently of one another.The Illinois Student Senate would greatly appreciate your support for plans to revise the composition of the student government. If you have not already, please Sign the Petition (https://illinois.edu/fb/sec/632204). Signing the petition simply means that you would like to see it on the March election ballot, and does not say that you support the proposed revisions.

It is my hope that this will become a new tradition here on our campus.On Saturday, April 20th, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will kick off National Volunteer Week with our inaugural Community-Campus Day of Service.  Units are encouraged to participate in or hold activities that benefit the local community on this day or at any time during the week.  One of the projects that is already being planned  on April 20th will involve packaging 146,000 meals - one thousand for every year since the University was chartered - that will be donated to local food banks and distributed to the many needy families right here in Urbana-Champaign.  We will need 350-400 volunteers for this project alone, and I am inviting all students, staff, and faculty to take part in this day of service.  Illinois is partnering with the United Way and local Rotary Clubs to organize other projects as well.  We will celebrate our commitment to the community in the afternoon after projects are completed with a casual reception at the Indi go Art Gallery in downtown Champaign.  Several campus units, including the Office of Public Engagement, the Office of Volunteer Programs, the Activities and Recreation Center, and Student Dining and Residential Programs, have already agreed to sponsor the Community-Campus Day of Service.  I encourage other units to sponsor or to get involved in this campus-wide initiative. Sarah Zehr from the College of Engineering has volunteered to lead the coordination of the event.  I hope you will join me in participating in one of these projects, and encourage those in your units to participate as well.  This is a wonderful opportunity to work as a team to benefit our community and demonstrate our commitment to public engagement.  You can learn more about the Day of Service and register to volunteer or report a project that your unit is working on at http://go.illinois.edu/DayOfService2013.  We are fortunate to live in such a vibrant community, which is one of the strengths of our university.

Please join us as we commemorate the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Sesquicentennial of the Emancipation Proclamation. One of the key objectives of this commemoration is to draw upon the Emancipation Proclamation and its legacy, along with the work of Dr. King, and to reflect on the meaning of freedom today. The Sesquicentennial is an appropriate moment to reflect on the progress and the work that remains in combatting involuntary servitude and fulfilling the promise of freedom throughout the global community. Featured events include an art exhibit of Jacob Lawrence's work, keynote addresses by Professor Thavolia Glymph and Professor Michelle Alexander, a performance by SWEET HONEY IN THE ROCK, and a Culminating Celebration featuring Dr. Myrlie Evers-Williams with performances by the University of Illinois Black Chorus and the Illinois Wind Symphony.

Any discrepancies between the amount withheld and the amount of the employee's actual liability for the additional Medicare tax will be reconciled on the individual's income tax return (Form 1040). - The University is required to begin withholding additional Medicare tax in the pay period in which it pays wages in excess of $200,000 to an employee. It may not withhold the additional Medicare tax before an employee's wages exceed the threshold.- An individual is liable for Additional Medicare Tax if the individual's wages or other compensation (together with that of his or her spouse if filing a joint return) exceed the threshold amount for the individual's filing status:Filing Status: Threshold AmountMarried filing jointly: $250,000Married filing separately: $125,000Single: $200,000Head of household (with qualifying person): $200,000Qualifying widow(er) with dependent child: $200,000- An employee who anticipates liability for the additional Medicare tax may request additional income tax withholding on Form W-4. Use this link to access the appropriate form: (https://nessie.uihr.uillinois.edu/cf/comp/index.cfm?Item_ID=1056).This statement is provided for information purposes only and is not intended to constitute individual tax advice.  Employees and students should consult with their individual tax advisor to assist with calculating their withholdings.- There are no special rules for nonresident aliens for purposes of this provision. Wages earned by such individuals that are subject to Medicare tax will be subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding if paid in excess of the $200,000 withholding threshold.Highlights of Healthcare Coverage Reporting on 2012 Tax Form W-2  - The IRS emphasizes that this new reporting is for information purposes only -- to inform employees of the cost of their health coverage -- and does not cause excludable employer-provided health coverage to become taxable. Employer-provided health coverage continues to be excludable from an employee's income and is not taxable.- Applicable employer-sponsored coverage means, with respect to any employee, coverage under any CMS group health plan made available to the employee by an employer that is excludable from the employee's gross income, or would be so excludable if it were employer-provided coverage.  This means that coverage paid for by employees, directly to CMS, on an after-tax basis (for example, employees on leave) is reportable on the W-2.- The reportable cost on the Form W-2 (in box 12 using code DD) generally includes both the portion of the cost paid by the employer and the portion of the cost paid by the employee, regardless of whether the employee paid for that cost through pre-tax or after-tax contributions.- The cost of a separate Dental and/or Vision plan is not included in the reportable cost of healthcare on the W-2.  Questions regarding the new changes can be addressed to UPB Customer Service at payinq@uillinois.edu or by calling one of these offices:  UIUC 217-265-6363, UIC 312-996-7200, UIS 217-206-7211."

Providing tuition support through assistantships, scholarships and other financial assistance is the cornerstone for maintaining the excellence of our graduate programs. The University has provided tuition waivers and other forms of financial support to graduate students for many years, and we are committed to doing so in the future. Providing tuition support is essential to our ability to recruit the best and brightest graduate students.University policy grants tuition support in the form of waivers for graduate students who have assistantships of 25% to 67%. In addition, the campus policy and practice is that graduate assistants do not face any changes to their assistantship tuition waiver support as long as they remain in the academic program (as identified by the graduate program code) in which they began, continue to hold a qualifying assistantship, are in good academic standing, and are making proper progress towards graduation in the academic program in which they began.  Our goal is to ensure that assistantship tuition waiver support is protected and that departments can continue to oversee the financial packages offered to attract students.The Urbana campus invests in excess of $100,000,000 annually in tuition support for assistants, some of which is recovered from grants and other sources. Our policies regarding waivers and scholarships are designed to be competitive with policies and practices of other world-class universities, in order to recruit highly qualified students.  We have proposed to the GEO language that reconfirms that assistantship tuition waiver support for students that are degree seeking will be continued.The GEO's second recurring theme is that the University pay proposals are unfair and do not provide assistants with a livable wage. Such accusations are inaccurate. Under the GEO contract that just expired, teaching and graduate assistants are guaranteed a minimum annual rate which translates to an approximate hourly rate of $19.00 per hour. The average rate on campus is $22.03 per hour (or $17,183 per year for an assistant with a 50% nine-month appointment). Over the three years of the GEO contract that just expired, the minimum stipend level was increased by 10%.  The University has presented wage proposals that would guarantee that continuing assistants would receive salary increases consistent with those given to other employees under the campus salary program.It should be emphasized that assistants with appointments ranging between 25% and 67% of full-time equivalency also receive tuition waivers worth between $11,432 and $24,698 per year (depending on residency status), plus health insurance, which is partially paid for by the University. On average, this amounts to a package of approximately $28,000 for a 50% nine-month teaching assistantship.  The University has presented wage proposals that would guarantee both that continuing assistants would receive salary increases consistent with those given to other employees under the campus salary program and provides a guaranteed increase to the minimum assistantship wage rate for each year of the contract.Despite the strike authorization vote taken by the GEO, we want you to know that a strike is neither inevitable nor necessary. The issues of tuition waivers and pay can be resolved through negotiation and mediation, as they have been in the past. We urge you to become familiar with the facts and make decisions based on all of the relevant information related to the negotiations process.  Sincerely, Ilesanmi AdesidaVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provostc:     Deans, Directors, Department Heads        Faculty"

My blog this week summarizes this talk and addresses diversity and its inextricable link to excellence.I want to share with you several next steps we are taking to ensure that we put actions behind my words as part of a new Inclusive Illinois initiative called Illinois EDGE - Enhancing Diversity, Guiding Excellence. I have created a small leadership group: the Chancellor's and Provost's Faculty Advisory Council on Diversity and Cultural Understanding. Professor James Anderson has agreed to serve as my senior advisor and to chair this council. Professor Anderson will be joined by three other senior faculty colleagues who will serve as Chancellor's Advisors on Diversity and Cultural Understanding: Dean Deba Dutta, Professor Steve Zimmerman, and Professor Sandra Rodriguez-Zas. The council will work closely with the existing Diversity Administrative Coordinating Team (DACT) that supports individuals, units, and the offices of the Chancellor, Student Affairs, and Provost to evaluate diversity initiatives. I have asked the council to initiate a listening and learning tour with executive officers, directors of graduate programs, department heads, and chairs to understand the challenges and opportunities related to diversity. I have asked them to develop an action plan to institutionalize a culture of diversity and excellence on campus through the development of a structure and culture of responsibility, incentive, and accountability. This plan should respect the importance of leadership at all levels and must include objectives, targets, goals, implementation steps, and timelines. I also have asked them to evaluate progress on the action plan and recommend adjustments to the chancellor and the provost based on their findings to facilitate the achievement of the goals and objectives. Finally, I have asked them to ensure that their efforts interconnect with our Visioning Future Excellence initiative. Associate Chancellor Menah Pratt-Clarke will be working closely with the council as well as DACT to ensure their efforts are aligned and consistent with what we, as a campus, want to achieve. I am committed to the Diversity Values Statement recently passed by the Academic Senate. That statement indicates 'We support diversity of worldviews, histories, and cultural knowledge across a range of social groups including race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, abilities, economic class, religion, and their intersections.' I look forward to each of you joining me in a renewed commitment to diversity and cultural understanding.Sincerely,Phyllis M. WiseVice President, University of IllinoisChancellor, University of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignRead more about the leaders of this initiative:Professor Jim Anderson has a long and distinguished history of research in this field and leads the Department of Education Policy, Organization, and Leadership ' one of the most diverse units on campus in terms of faculty, staff, students and curriculum. Most recently, he served as interim dean of the College of Education. Together, his scholarship and his academic leadership experience make him uniquely qualified to lead these efforts.Professor Steve Zimmerman most recently served as chair of the Department of Chemistry and serves on the chancellor's and provost's Gender Equity Council. He has demonstrated a significant commitment to issues of diversity, particularly those related to women in the sciences.  Professor Sandra Rodriguez-Zas is a well-respected scholar in Animal Sciences and Statistics and helps lead the Latino New Biology Initiative in the College of ACES. She is an important voice on issues of cultural and gender diversity and has demonstrated success in student recruitment. Dean Deba Dutta serves as dean of the Graduate College and as associate provost. He has initiated an aggressive program within the Graduate College to increase the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities. He will be a critical link to the Provost's Office and to other deans on these diversity efforts.  Members of DACT:Vice Provost Barb Wilson, Associate Chancellor Menah Pratt-Clarke, Senate Chair Matthew Wheeler, Student Senate President Brock Gebhardt, Vice Chancellor Renee Romano, and Dean Ruth Watkins.Watch the chancellor's speech at the Celebration of Diversity:http://www.inclusiveillinois.illinois.edu/Demonstrate.htmlRead the chancellor's blog on diversity and excellence:http://illinois.edu/blog/view/1109Visit the Visioning Future Excellence site:http://www.oc.illinois.edu/visioning/index.html Read the Academic Senate's Diversity Values Statement:http://www.inclusiveillinois.illinois.edu/Demonstrate.html"

Springfield Avenue, ChampaignThe Champaign Police has relesased the following information:Over the weekend, Champaign Police responded to four reports of batteries and thefts that appear to be related.  The victims in these incidents reported being ""punched"" in the head by someone in a group as they were walking down the sidewalk.  The victims reported that the offenders were among a group of three males and three females.  These incidents occurred after curfew, between 1:30 a.m. and 3:22 a.m., and in the areas of 500 E. Healey, 700 S. Sixth, 300 E. Springfield, and 200 E. John.During one of the incidents, which occurred on September 30th, in the 300 block of E. Springfield Avenue, a 19 year-old women's cell phone was taken after she was punched by an unknown female.  Two females, ages 15 and 16, and a 16 year-old male were later located and arrested for this one incident.  However, based on the witness statements it is believed this group may be responsible for all four incidents.The Champaign Police is concerned that these incidents are similar to a recent phenomenon circulating on the internet called ""Point them out, knock them out"". Simply stated, the offending group identifies an unsuspecting victim and one of the offenders punches the victim in the head then flees the area.  The Champaign Police Department has been investigating five similar random incidents on campus over the past few weeks.  But, this weekend's events are clearly a spike in this type of activity.In an effort to deter this activity, the Champaign Police will be providing additional officers on campus to address the problem.  The University of Illinois Police will also be assisting to addressing these behaviors.  Officers will be aggressively enforcing curfew violations and making contact with subjects on campus who appear to be violating the curfew ordinance.Officers encourage pedestrians in the campus area to be aware of their surroundings at times and officer the following tips to avoid being victimized.- Walk in groups and use well-lighted routes, wherever possible.- Avoid walking near groups of loitering juveniles and/or non-college age individuals.- Report to police any confrontations and/or threats from groups of juveniles and/or non-college age individuals.- Be aware of your surroundings and do not be distracted by your cell phone or mp3 player.- If you drink, please be responsible for yourself and look out for your friends who may be intoxicated.The Champaign Police Department encourages parents to ensure their children do not violate the City's curfew ordinance, which carries a fine of $175.Sec. 23-211. - Curfew establishes; hours; exceptions; enforcement:a. No person thirteen (13) years of age or younger shall be or remain upon any street, alley, or other public place in the City  between the hours of 10:30 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.b.No person between the ages of fourteen (14) through sixteen (16), inclusive, shall be on any street, alley or other public place in the City between the hours of 11:00 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, inclusive, and 6:00 a.m. the following day, or between the hours of 12:01 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday.The Champaign and University of Illinois Police Departments are actively working to identify and apprehend the offenders in these incidents.  Anyone with information is asked to call Champaign Police at 217-351-4545 or callers can remain anonymous by calling Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (TIPS).  Tips can also be submitted through www.373tips.com or text by sending CCTIP plus the information to 274637 (CRIMES).Jeffrey T.

2012-09-19T05:15:00Z,2012-09-19,5:15,63700,Annual Test of Emergency Response/Evacuation Plans,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/26673.html,"Members of the Campus Community,The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign recently completed a test of our emergency response and evacuation plans. The test included two components: a drill and an exercise. The drill (a test of our Illini-Alert emergency notification system) was initiated on Sept. 11 at 10 a.m. This drill was announced ahead of time by campus Massmail and an Eweek notice. The Illini-Alert system sent an email to the illinois.edu addresses of all active faculty, staff and students. Those who have registered alternate email addresses also received an email notification. Those who have registered a cellphone were sent a text message during this drill.In an attempt to increase the speed and breadth of emergency communications, the campus increased Illini-Alert modes of emergency communication to include Facebook and Twitter. This multi-modal approach provides a robust communication engine that will continue to function successfully even if one system fails to work properly.If you have not signed up to receive emergency messages through Illini-Alert, please visit http://emergency.illinois.edu to register.The second component of the test was a tabletop exercise conducted Sept. 12 from 9 a.m. to noon at the Champaign County Emergency Operations Center. The exercise was announced in advance in a campus Eweek notice. The tabletop exercise involved multiple bomb threats that affected campus buildings. The exercise scenario tested various components of the Campus Emergency Operations Plan, including evacuation procedures.EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION PROCEDURESIf a situation arises that poses a verified, imminent or ongoing threat to the safety, security or health of students or employees, a Campus Alert will be issued to expedite emergency response and/or evacuation procedures. The goal of a Campus Alert is to notify as many people as possible, as rapidly as possible, with adequate follow-up information as needed. Follow-up information will be available through the Illini-Alert emergency notification system on a case-by-case basis. If follow-up information is critical to the community, it may be disseminated using additional mechanisms at the discretion of the Executive Director of Public Safety or designee. Additional mechanisms may include public media outlets, NOAA emergency alert radios, Comcast Cable channel 7 (UI-7), #265-UIPD and/or the telephone alert directory. Campus Alerts are issued for incidents such as an active threat/shooter, major hazardous materials release, major fire, extended power outage, infectious disease outbreak, or a tornado that would directly impact campus.The university has implemented a formal process that gives the on-duty U. of I. Police shift commander, Executive Director of Public Safety, and/or designee the authority to do the following: '  Confirm a significant emergency or dangerous situation; '  Develop the content and determine the appropriate segment(s) of the campus community to receive the notification; '  Initiate some or all of the campus alert systems to send an emergency message to the campus community. The process also stipulates that an immediate emergency message will not be sent if, in the professional judgment of authorities, the message would compromise efforts to assist a victim, or to contain, respond to or otherwise mitigate the emergency. It also authorizes the on-duty U. of I. Police shift commander, Executive Director of Public Safety, and/or designee to create and initiate the Campus Alert. The Executive Director of Public Safety and/or designee may also consult directly with Public Affairs to ensure an immediate, timely notification to the campus using the emergency notification mechanisms mentioned previously.EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND EVACUATION PROCEDURES/PREPAREDNESS PLANSAs required by federal and state law, the University of Illinois has a comprehensive emergency operation plan that details immediate response and evacuation procedures, including the use of electronic and cellular communication. The university's Campus Emergency Operations Plan includes information about Incident Management Teams, university operating status parameters; incident priorities; shelter-in-place and evacuation guidelines and overall command and control procedures. University departments are responsible for developing their own building emergency action plans and continuity of operations plans for their staff and areas of responsibility.As a part of the comprehensive emergency operation plan for the university, regularly scheduled drills, exercises and follow-through activities are conducted annually. Minimally, tabletop exercises are conducted for various campus units identified as having emergency response responsibilities in order to test response and evacuation procedures. All exercises are documented and appropriate after-action-reports are completed and submitted to the state of Illinois for review pursuant to the Illinois Campus Security Enhancement Act. After-action-reports are completed detailing lessons learned, and follow-up items are identified with responsibilities assigned to appropriate campus entities. The university's Basic Emergency Operation Plan, which is compliant with the Illinois Campus Security Enhancement Act, is posted on the Division of Public Safety website to be used in conjunction with campus exercises.U. of I. police officers and supervisors have received training on the National Incident Management System, which includes use of the Incident Command System. This federally mandated training is designed to assist first responders in responding to and managing critical incidents. If a serious incident occurs that causes an immediate threat to campus, personnel from the University of Illinois, Urbana and Champaign police departments, Urbana and Champaign fire departments, PRO Ambulance and ARROW Ambulance will usually be the first on scene. Personnel from these agencies typically respond and work together to manage a critical incident. Depending on the size, scope and seriousness of the incident, other university departments and/or other local or federal agencies could also be involved in the response.Evacuation drills are coordinated by University Housing, Code Compliance and Fire Safety and local fire departments each semester for all university residence halls to ensure that emergency response and evacuation procedures are tested at least twice each year. Prior to conducting drills, university housing residents are provided emergency evacuation information. Additionally, evacuation routes are posted on the doors of resident hall rooms. Residents are not told in advance about the designated locations for long-term evacuations because those decisions are affected by time of day, location of the building being evacuated, the availability of the various designated emergency gathering locations on campus, and other factors such as the location and nature of the threat. In these cases, university housing staff and/or first responders on scene will communicate information to students regarding the developing situation or any evacuation status changes. In addition to educating occupants about the evacuation procedures during the drills, the process also provides the university an opportunity to test the operation of fire alarm system components.Evacuation drills are evaluated by university housing staff, Code Compliance and Fire Safety and local fire departments to review egress and behavioral patterns. Reports are prepared by participating departments that identify deficient equipment so that repairs can be made immediately. Recommendations for improvements are also submitted to the appropriate departments/offices for consideration.Students who reside in university residence halls receive information about evacuation and shelter-in-place procedures during their first floor meetings and during other educational sessions they can participate in throughout the year. University housing staff members are trained in these procedures as well and act as an on-going resource for the students living in residential facilities.Shelter-in-Place ProceduresThere may be emergencies that arise that do not afford people the opportunity to evacuate from their location. During these types of emergencies, sheltering-in-place may be necessary. Sheltering-in-place means to stay inside a known, safe area to avoid adverse conditions in an exterior environment. Examples of emergencies where the shelter-in-place option may be necessary and/or preferred include severe weather (tornado) or a situation involving an active shooter. This may also include a fire emergency for persons with disabilities who are not able to leave the building on their own or if the elevator is recalled during a fire.Basic Shelter-in-Place GuidanceIf an incident occurs that does not present a safe opportunity to evacuate, find an immediate place of safety and stay there until it is safe to leave. This may include locking the door(s) or barricading the ingress/egress point(s) of the area you are occupying. It may also include covering the windows to decrease visibility of the occupied area. If an incident occurs where a shelter-in-place option is not possible, leave the area immediately following the evacuation procedures for your building. Follow the directions of police and/or fire personnel if they are on scene of the incident.How You Will Know to Shelter-in-PlaceA shelter-in-place notification may come from several sources, including the U. of I. Police Department (by means of the Illini-Alert emergency notification system), the Office of Public Affairs, other university employees or other authorities utilizing the university's emergency communications tools.How to Shelter in-PlaceIf an incident occurs where sheltering-in-place is the best option, follow these steps, unless instructed otherwise by emergency personnel:These steps should only be followed if safe to do so:'  Once aware of the emergency, seek or remain in a location deemed safe from the affected area.'  Once within a safe area, attempt to secure the space in whatever reasonable manner is applicable.'  Stay in the area of safety and remain quiet, unless making noise would be beneficial to your safety (for example, to increase the likelihood of rescue or recovery).'  Stay away from objects that may lead to higher risk of injury.'  Do not leave the area of safety until you are notified that the emergency is no longer a threat to personal safety.The Division of Public Safety hopes this information is useful to all those who work, study and visit our campus community.Lieutenant Todd ShortUniversity of Illinois Police Department/Office of Campus Emergency Planning"

First, I would like to thank all of you for your incredible dedication, resolve, and energy. Any large, complex institution is ultimately defined by its people and the excellent reputation that our university enjoys is because of your efforts. Our campus received an almost $18M reduction in our state appropriation. (This adds to a total decline of $46M since FY10).  We anticipated this decrease and took appropriate steps. Because of the measures we took we did not have to reduce the current operating budgets of units to fund the reduction.As we have experienced all too often in recent years, the State currently owes the University $221M for FY12. We do anticipate that the State, as it has done in the past, will make these overdue payments by the end of December. Still, the late payments cause an undue burden on our cash-flow planning strategies and create some financial uncertainty. Despite these challenges, we have taken steps to remain competitive in salaries. We had a salary program in FY12 and we have another in place for this current year. For those not represented by collective bargaining agreements, we have provided 2.5% for a general merit program with a portion of that program targeted to special market/equity concerns. Of course, as this is a merit program, no one is guaranteed an increase.Finally, we continue to closely monitor the State's attempts to put our pension system on a firmer financial footing. Pension reform by the State is inevitable and we will work closely with President Easter and our campus counterparts at UIS and UIC to ensure that changes made will protect the interests of our employees and the campus. Yes, we face difficult and persistent challenges but I am confident in our ability to not only confront these current challenges but also to plan a long-term future that is sustainable while allowing for growth. Again, thank you for all that you do on behalf of this great university.Sincerely,Phyllis M. Wise Vice President, University of IllinoisChancellor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"

He will be working closely with Vice President Christophe Pierre and other University officers and academic leaders on each campus to develop and coordinate various strategic initiatives of benefit to the entire University of Illinois.Professor Wheeler's term as Interim Provost proved to be much longer and much more active than most would have anticipated. Our campus called upon him to provide a steadying hand and wise leadership through a challenging period, made more difficult by the economic downturn and the state's lack of promised financial support. It speaks highly of his commitment and his ability to bring our campus community together that the academic foundation of the institution is stronger today than it was when he assumed the role in 2010. In his four decades at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Professor Wheeler has distinguished himself as a world-renowned Shakespeare scholar and as a dedicated administrator. He has served in a variety of leadership roles, including Head of the Department of English, Dean of the Graduate College, Vice Provost, and Interim Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. A common, unifying thread runs throughout all of these years and these roles. His first priority always has been the students, faculty and staff who are the heart of the university. He has willingly and enthusiastically undertaken any task that would advance how we teach, how we learn and how we lead. His leadership, integrity and his determination to protect and to advance the reputation of Illinois have been critical.Thank you Dick, for your service in all of these roles and for your unwavering support of the University of Illinois.Sincerely,Phyllis M. WiseVice President, University of IllinoisChancellor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"

This serves our land-grant mission by sharing knowledge with people who can't physically come to our campus, and it allows us to introduce ourselves to prospective students and lifelong learners across our state and around the globe.Coursera's goal, and now ours, is to ""empower people with education that will improve their lives, the lives of their families, and the communities they live in.""  This is one of the answers to the question, ""How do we plan the future of higher education so that we reach as many people on this planet as possible?""  Coursera allows us to reach out to lifelong learners - people who cannot physically get to our campus, but who have an interest in learning from our world-class faculty.  Coursera is a wonderful compliment to what we offer. Coursera was founded in the fall of 2011 by Stanford Computer Science Professors Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng, and in April 2012 announced that Princeton, University of Michigan, Stanford and Penn were entering into agreement with Coursera to bring course content online for free.  To date, Coursera has seen over 680,000 students from 190 countries and more than 1.6 million course enrollments across its 43 courses.Courses are free to take on the Coursera platform, but Coursera monetizes services around these courses.  Any profits will be shared with partner universities.  For example, if a student wants a certificate that acknowledges their completion of the course, they purchase this from Coursera.  Coursera shares these revenues with the university.  We will start the actual instruction of these courses later in the fall.  It is worth noting that the online form allows us extreme flexibility in the style and timing of their delivery.  Please join me in thanking everyone involved in making this a reality for us, especially the Senate Executive Committee; Rob Rutenbar, Abel Bliss Professor and Head of the Department of Computer Science; and Nick Burbules, Gutgsell Professor and Chair-elect of the University Senates Conference.Sincerely,Phyllis M.

I extend my appreciation to the many who participated in the survey, those who worked to analyze the findings, and all who will undertake a study of the results.  The University is committed to improving climate where improvement is needed, striving for a positive environment for all its students and its employees.

2012-06-06T05:04:00Z,2012-06-06,5:4,14122,Legislative Update,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/24426.html,"June 5, 2012Members of the University of Illinois community, The Illinois General Assembly concluded its annual spring legislative session last week, but lawmakers left some unfinished business that is critical to the state and our University employees. The legislature could not reach agreement on a funding stabilization plan for the state's public pension systems. It is uncertain whether Gov. Pat Quinn will convene a special summer session in Springfield to address the pension issue, or if legislators and the governor will wait until after the November election. Either way, the University of Illinois stands ready to continue to participate in the dialogue, providing important information and perspective to legislators, and advocating on behalf of the University, its employees and retirees for a solution that maintains core employee benefits and payment of unfunded liabilities by the state. We value stability in the pension system because of the impact it has on the lives of our people and on the fiscal viability of the state.Illinois' fiscal condition factored into other legislative outcomes that are important to the University:Fiscal year 2013 budget appropriation. The General Assembly passed and sent to Gov. Quinn's desk a higher education operating appropriation that is 6.17 percent less than the current fiscal 2012 appropriation. This represents a $42.5 million reduction in the University of Illinois appropriation to $646.6 million. A reduction in the University's appropriation of general revenue funds was anticipated and budget scenarios to deal with it are being developed across the campuses. Medicaid. The legislature enacted major Medicaid reforms that included a $1.6 billion budget cut for the program; an increase in tobacco taxes to help fund health care; and new requirements for charity care provided by hospitals in Illinois. Although the University's Hospital & Healthcare System's patients and clinical operations were not spared from the budget cuts, many of our key programmatic strengths were unaffected.Health Care Insurance for Retirees. In an effort to address the cost of providing health care for state retirees, the General Assembly passed, and Gov. Quinn said he will sign, legislation (SB1313) that modifies premium payments for retiree health care insurance by allowing the director of the state Department of Central Management Services (CMS) to set the premiums. Premiums will be based on income and length of service. The effective date would be July 1, 2012. An annual rate-setting process will occur, providing universities, employees and retirees an opportunity to express their views.Re-employment of retirees. The University worked closely with legislative sponsors on a bill that limits public universities in re-employment of their retirees (HB4996). It was passed in the House and Senate, and Gov. Quinn is expected to sign it into law. Effective in the 2014 academic year, it sets financial conditions on the University for retirees who are employed for more than 18 weeks in an academic year and earn more than 40 percent of their previous salary. However, it would exempt from these rules those whose salaries are funded by grants or gifts. Human resource policies and procedures are being reviewed to determine what changes should be made to comply with the new law. For additional information about these and other legislative initiatives you can go to the General Assembly website, www.ilga.gov. The University will provide updates as events may warrant.Sincerely,Michael J. Hogan, PresidentRobert A. Easter, President Designate"

It would have to be approved by both houses of the legislature and signed by the Governor before it is implemented. The legislation, House Amendment #3 to Senate Bill 1673, is posted at http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/97/SB/09700SB1673ham003.htm, for review.The plan does not increase the pension contribution by employees, nor does it change effective retirement ages. It requires the state to fund 100 percent of the current estimated $83 billion pension liability in an accelerated manner. It transfers to employers such as the University the annual 'normal costs' for funding employee pensions, but does so in a phased-in, 10-year period that starts in fiscal year 2014.It presents annuitants and employees with options for retirement benefits, providing choices for individuals. The annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) to the annuity and participation in the state-sponsored retiree health care program are the crux of these options. The plan would change the manner in which COLA is calculated. Individuals who are in the self-managed retirement plan (SMP) and those who joined the Tier II program after January 1, 2011, are not affected by these options.However, Tier I employees, those who joined the University before January 2011, would be required to choose one of the following options:1.Retain all current benefits and contribution level, except COLA. The COLA would start at age 67 or five years after retirement, whichever occurs first, and would be the lesser of 3 percent or ' of the consumer price index (CPI), calculated on the original annuity. The employee would retain eligibility for state-sponsored retiree health care, and future salary increases would count toward calculation of the retirement benefit.2.Retain current benefits and contribution level, but lose eligibility to participate in the state-sponsored retiree health care program, and future salary increases would not count toward calculation of a pension annuity;Current retirees and those who retire before July 1, 2013, could keep their 3 percent annual COLA on a compound interest basis, but would have to forgo access to the state's retiree health care plan. Or, they could keep the retiree health care benefit by moving to the lesser COLA. The bill also proposes a revised program for new employees joining the University after July 1, 2013. The new 'cash balance' plan combines features of defined-benefit and defined-contribution retirement programs, with a portion of the benefits guaranteed and a portion that depends on market returns earned by the State Universities Retirement System of Illinois (SURS). As proposed, the legislative changes to the pension system will be effective July 1, 2013. The benefits choice period for Tier I employees will be Jan. 1 through May 31, 2013. SURS is required under the proposal to provide its members with detailed information about the changes in coming months. The University of Illinois will collaborate with SURS to provide this information and supplement it as needed to ensure our employees understand the options and critical dates. The pension legislation was months in the making as lawmakers in Springfield considered various proposals to stabilize the state's pension systems for the long-term future. The University of Illinois was integrally involved in the effort, advocating on behalf of the University and its employees. We encourage you to learn more about these developments as they unfold in the coming days and months, and the University will provide updates as additional information becomes available.Sincerely,Michael J. Hogan, PresidentRobert A. Easter, President Designate"

The situation in Springfield is fluid as the May 31 deadline to end the spring session approaches. Specific details of a pension stabilization plan have not been introduced. University of Illinois leaders have been advocating strongly on behalf of our employees regarding pensions and other issues. I traveled to Springfield twice last week to meet personally with House Speaker Michael Madigan, Senate President John Cullerton, and key members of their staffs. Dr. Avijit Ghosh, special assistant to the president who has been on-point for the U of I on the pension issue, and our governmental relations staff are at the capitol and in constant contact with legislative staffers.Our  team has reiterated that an acceptable pension stabilization plan should follow principles and objectives such as:  fair and equitable distribution of the pension obligation; an adequate time period to transition to a new system so that employees and the University can plan; future financial sustainability for all parties involved; flexibility to provide a credible promise of retirement security for employees, and to provide universities with the ability to recruit and retain staff and faculty. The foundation of the University's excellence is its people, their skills and talents. This priority is reflected in our daily interactions with the state legislature. As events unfold in Springfield, we will provide updates.Sincerely,Robert A. Easter, President-designate"
2012-05-15T10:03:00Z,2012-05-15,10:3,14052,Legislative update,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/23924.html,"May 15, 2012Members of the University of Illinois community:The Illinois General Assembly is entering the final three weeks of its scheduled spring session, and most of the major issues still to be addressed could have a serious impact on the University of Illinois and our dedicated employees. Among those we are paying especially close attention to are: our state general revenue appropriation, stabilization of the public pension system, Medicaid funding for our hospital, and provisions for rehiring retirees.The common denominator, of course, is the state's continuing fiscal crisis. Other issues are in the Springfield mix, too, but we have identified the dominant subjects in what long-time observers agree has been the most challenging and potentially momentous legislative session in decades. Along with our governmental relations staff, we have been advocating strongly on behalf of the University, its employees, alumni, annuitants, and the state of Illinois, and we will continue to do so in the closing weeks. We welcome your support. You have every right as an individual to make your feelings known as well.Public pension funding is the dominant issue and changes to the state pension systems likely will be made during this session, with litigation to follow. Last year the U of I helped to stop a bill that would have imposed an unfair burden on employees for solving the pension funding crisis. Meantime, we have proposed alternatives and worked with leaders from the other public universities to mitigate the most onerous aspects of pension stabilization plans being considered in Springfield. The University Senates Conference last month endorsed principles and objectives for a viable pension funding solution that reflect the arguments we have presented to elected officials.An example of the legislative pace in Springfield occurred last week with the quick passage of Senate Bill 1313, which requires retired state employees -- including those from universities -- to pay a portion of the health insurance premium that the state currently covers. The University formally opposed the bill. But soon after the proposal surfaced, the legislation passed by wide margins in both the House and Senate on back-to-back days. Gov. Pat Quinn is expected to sign it into law. The law requires an annual process for setting the premiums, which will allow the University, employees and annuitants to provide input.While another successful academic year has just wrapped up, important work remains to be completed in Springfield. Our team will continue to represent the University's interest, and we will keep you informed.Sincerely,Michael J. Hogan, PresidentRobert A. Easter, President-designate"

The Urbana-Champaign campus received commitments and gifts totaling more than $1.671 billion; the entire campaign's final total was $2.43 billion. Each and every faculty and staff member should be recognized for their dedication and effort.  Just to put some things in perspective. The total for the last campaign that ended in 2000 by all three UI campuses was $1.53 billion. We raised $141 million more than all three campuses combined. And you did it! The Brilliant Futures Campaign is the largest in University history and one of the most ambitious in the history of higher education in the country. Currently there have been approximately 20 capital campaigns with a goal of more than $2 billion. We had many different highlights during the campaign. A couple that stands out is that we have commitments for 70 new funds for named chairs and professorships and 1,246 new funds for fellowships and scholarships. Outstanding faculty members are the magnets that attract incredible students to our campus. Also more than 9,300 current and former faculty and staff members contributed during the campaign. When we reflect back on the campaign what stood out for us was the way that you were able to expertly match the passions of our donors with the ambitions of our mission. We know that in many important ways you are the front door to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Campaign. You are the face of the campus. Critical to our success during Brilliant Futures was the way you conducted yourselves, the way you communicated our message, and the way that you engaged the prospective donors. You did all of this with a level of professionalism and creativity that goes beyond anything that we have ever witnessed in the past. No wonder we met and exceeded our goal.So as we celebrate this great accomplishment let us celebrate your tireless dedication, your commitment to excellence, the sacrifices you made to your own personal time, the miles you logged, the countless hours researching donors and drafting proposal, your teamwork, and most of all your passion to Illinois. Thank you for making the Brilliant Futures Campaign the most successful in the history of this great university. Thank you! With sincere gratitude,Phyllis M.

We have partnered with the Office of Privacy and Information Assurance to provide a webpage of considerations and recommendations regarding UC privacy. Examples of the types of issues discussed on the webpage include:- Individuals using the Windows Lync client can initiate recording a phone call. A visual warning will be displayed to all call participants using the Windows Lync client if another participant initiates a recording. Callers who are not using Lync will receive an audible notification. Mac users will not receive notification that a call is being recorded.- Lync phone calls are never recorded by CITES, nor does CITES have the ability to 'tap' phone calls: no call can be recovered after the fact if it was not recorded by a Lync user who participated in the call.- Instant messages (IM) are encrypted as they travel between computers and are, by default, stored in individual users' inboxes. Users on either side of an IM conversation can choose to save the conversation.  You have the option to disable IM saving on your machine, but not the machine of the other user.   You should avoid writing anything in an instant message that you wouldn't feel comfortable including in an email.- You can control how your calendar is shared.

2012-05-04T05:04:00Z,2012-05-04,5:4,14320,Pension letter to Gov. Quinn and legislative leaders,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/23646.html,"Members of the University of Illinois community:In these closing weeks of the scheduled legislative session in Springfield, there is heightened attention and activity around the critical issue of stabilizing the underfunded liabilities of Illinois' five public pension systems, including the State Universities Retirement System (SURS).Leaders of our state's public universities have been engaged on their respective campuses and in Springfield for over a year to identify an equitable solution to the unsustainable pension funding shortfall. On Thursday, the presidents and chancellors of the state's public universities acted in unison to provide a ""Statement of Objectives"" for successfully resolving this issue. They did so in a letter to Gov. Pat Quinn and to the four leaders of the state House and Senate. The letter states that any changes affecting SURS must provide ""a credible certainty of retirement security to our employees."" It lays out principles and specific conditions essential for a successful pension stabilization proposal. ""It must also be financially sustainable for the state, the universities, the participant, and it must respect existing constitutional protection against impairment of already-accrued pension benefits,"" the letter stated.Last week our University Senates Conference (USC) approved a resolution endorsing a similar set of principles and objectives. We commend the USC and faculty members for helping to draw attention to this important issue. We and our government relations team will continue to strongly advocate on this issue as the legislative session, scheduled to end May 31, progresses, as we have been throughout these discussions.

Its elected members approved a resolution last Friday that endorses reforms that would improve the financial footing of the State Universities Retirement System (SURS). The resolution embraces pension funding principles espoused by the Institute of Government and Public Affairs (IGPA) of the University of Illinois. The USC resolution is a sign that the highest group in the shared governance structure of the University of Illinois recognizes the need to address the SURS funding shortfall and for shared obligation.The full resolution and links to additional information are below.-- Donald A. Chambers   Professor and Chair   University Senates ConferenceResolution on PensionsUniversity Senates ConferenceApril 27, 2012The University Senates Conference (USC), in its role as a faculty elected advisory body to the President of the University and the Board of Trustees, recognizes that the funding basis for the State University Retirement System (SURS) is not sustainable in its current form. Previous underfunding of the system has made SURS unable to continue to pay out benefits indefinitely at current levels, even though participants have fully contributed their portion of responsibility for the system.As has been documented, Illinois ranks 50th among the 50 states in adequately funding its public pensions. This situation cannot be allowed to continue; retaining and recruiting top faculty to our universities will be increasingly difficult unless this issue is addressed.Today we face a reality in which sensible, equitable reforms are needed. The USC writes to acknowledge this reality and to seek a constructive way forward. Reforms will be needed in order to return the SURS system to a sound financial footing, and all stakeholders ' participants, the universities, and the State ' have a necessary role to play in such reforms. These reforms must be guided by certain agreed-upon principles, the most important of which is fairness to university employees who entered the system on the basis of certain understandings and commitments that need to be honored.Other principles also seem to us reasonable and prudent as a solution is being worked out. Many of these principles are laid out and defended in the IGPA report authored by Jeffrey R. Brown and Robert F. Rich: Fiscal Sustainability and Retirement Security: A Reform Proposal for the Illinois State Universities Retirement Systems (SURS), Institute of Government & Public Affairs, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Chicago. Springfield, Feb. 9, 2012.'  Any reformed SURS system must be financially sustainable for the State, the universities, and the participants, and it must respect existing constitutional protections of already-accrued benefits;'  All promised benefits to current participants and annuitants should be maintained, as guaranteed by the State Constitution (Article 8, Section 5 General Provisions);'  Existing unfunded liabilities must remain the State's responsibility, and the State must provide credible guarantees that future payments will be made on time (such as through a clause that state contributions to the system must have priority);'  In addition, the State should continue to make its contributions to the system at a level at least equal to the level of what it would be paying to Social Security (6.2% of pay) along with its contributions to health care;'  Any transfer of normal costs to universities must be nominal, and phased in gradually;'  Any reform must include improvements to the current Tier II program for new employees, as suggested in the IGPA position paper referenced above (this could include a hybrid plan combining some elements of defined benefits and an employee self-managed plan), and this revised program should also be available to Tier I employees;'  Any change in participant contributions must involve consultations with those affected. The USC is ready to participate in further discussions in order to seek a constructive resolution to these issues.IGPA report:  http://igpa.uillinois.edu/pensions/SURS-paper  USC transmittal letter:  http://www.uillinois.edu/our/news/2012/Apr30.USCtransmittal.pdf  ."

Thank you to all who participated by taking the survey and sharing your views.   Overall, approximately 17,000 faculty, staff and students responded to the survey, an overall response rate of 16.2%.  The number of responses is gratifying for a baseline study, and will provide us a great deal of information about how climate is viewed at the University of Illinois.  While a higher response rate would have been welcome, SRL's past work indicates the typical student response rate tends to be low so the outcome is not unexpected.  Summary information on the response rates is available on the Climate Survey website.The Climate Survey data report will be released in the coming weeks.  I am in the process of forming a cross-campus committee, which will meet to consider the results of the data report.Please continue to check the climate survey website, which will be updated periodically as information is available.  http://www.uillinois.edu/ClimateSurvey/Christophe PierreVice President for Academic AffairsUniversity of Illinois377 Henry Administration Building506 South Wright StreetUrbana, IL  61801"

Last Friday, Gov. Quinn announced his proposal to stabilize the state's public pension system that includes the State University Retirement System (SURS). The proposal is limited to the SURS traditional benefit plan and does not impact employees in SURS self-managed plans. The Governor's proposal includes increasing employee contributions, raising the retirement age, and reducing cost-of-living adjustments. The proposal does not identify an effective date for the changes or suggested phase-in periods.Let me stress that this is only a proposal, and no legislation has been introduced. We will closely monitor its progress through the legislative session. We also will be actively engaged in proposing adjustments and amendments to the proposal to minimize the financial impact on our dedicated employees and protect retirement benefits earned. Approval of the proposal by the legislature in its present form is uncertain.I fully appreciate the concern you may have about your retirement system and the impact these proposed changes may have on you and our great University.

2012-04-05T05:04:00Z,2012-04-05,5:4,9985,Lab Safety,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/22506.html,"Dear Colleagues,I am writing to those of you who oversee research laboratories to make you aware of two recent events that have focused national attention on laboratory safety in academia.On October 19, 2011, the U.S. Chemical Safety Board released a report on a laboratory explosion at Texas Tech University in 2010. The explosion resulted in the loss of three fingers, eye damage, burns, and other injuries to a graduate student. The Chemical Safety Board is an independent federal agency charged with investigating industrial chemical accidents. It also reviews the effectiveness of agency regulations and enforcement activities. Though the Chemical Safety Board has no regulatory authority, the Board's findings must be taken seriously. More information at http://www.csb.gov/newsroom/detail.aspx?nid=386 On December 27, 2011, the Los Angeles District Attorney filed felony charges against a UCLA professor and the Regents of the University of California for violations of labor laws in the death of a researcher that occurred almost three years earlier. The tragic death resulted from a laboratory accident in which a pyrophoric chemical ignited and caused severe burns that were ultimately fatal to the researcher. If convicted, the professor could face more than four years in prison and UCLA up to $1.5 million in fines on each of the three counts.  According to at least one news report, this criminal case may be the nation's first stemming from an academic laboratory accident. More information at http://articles.latimes.com/2011/dec/28/local/la-me-1228-ucla-death-20111228 Though the cases are pending, these events reiterate the expectation that universities and faculty ensure that their students and employees work in a safe environment. Both UCLA and Texas Tech have undergone profound institutional changes as a result of these incidents. It is prudent that we at Illinois make sure that we are taking appropriate steps to protect the safety of all laboratory workers. I have directed the Division of Research Safety to review campus laboratory safety guidance and policies, to develop metrics to assess laboratory safety, and to work closely with investigators to ensure safety of all our laboratory workers.Here's what you can do: * Maintain a consistently strong safety culture in your laboratories. Two very visible actions are to ensure that all laboratory workers use proper personal protective equipment at all times and that floors, counters, hoods, and shelves in your laboratory be kept free of clutter. * Ensure that all of your laboratory workers have both general laboratory safety training through DRS and that you provide additional laboratory-specific training to address potential hazards in your laboratories. Make sure that all training is well documented. See: http://www.drs.illinois.edu/training/index.aspx.* Verify that you have a Chemical Hygiene Plan which is required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). * DRS provides templates if you do not have a plan. See: http://www.drs.illinois.edu/css/guidesplans/chyp/index.aspx.* Promptly address all unsafe conditions. Remember that DRS can provide assistance to you in identifying, assessing,and mitigating hazards. Please review these issues with your laboratory group, and feel free to contact my office jnova@illinois.edu or DRS peteash@illinois.edu with any ideas for improving laboratory safety on our campus.Sincerely,BobRobert A.

As you know, President Michael Hogan has resigned effective July 1, 2012.  I hope you will join me in thanking Dr. Hogan for his service on behalf of the University.  Additionally, I want to express my personal appreciation to Dr. Hogan for appointing me chancellor of this great university and to him and Virginia, for their many acts of kindness toward Dick and me.  Dr. Hogan's pride in the University was always evident and his goal was one that we shared: to make the University better.Until July 1, Dr. Robert A. Easter will be president-designate. On July 1, Dr. Easter will become president for at least two years. As interim chancellor, and someone who has been on this campus for almost four decades, Dr. Easter was instrumental in my smooth transition to chancellor. We first met in China last summer, but I was already well aware of his stellar reputation both as a renowned and respected researcher and as an effective administrator who can make tough decisions in a humane and fair manner. The high level of integrity for which he is known is beyond reproach. The excellent reputation Dr. Easter has earned on our campus and in the broader national and international higher education arena is one that will serve all three campuses well as we move forward. I am very confident Dr. Easter will be an outstanding president.We share in our setbacks. Let us work together to create a future in which the highest ethical standards guide our every move, in which our stakeholders can look to us with pride as we help shape the lives of young women and men, preparing them for a chance at the American Dream through learning, discovery, and outreach.  Leadership changes are critical in any organization but the future of this campus ultimately belongs to each and every one of us, including faculty, students, support staff, administrative professionals, deans, and directors. We share in our successes. Sincerely,Phyllis M. WiseVice President, University of IllinoisChancellor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"
2012-03-22T13:40:00Z,2012-03-22,13:40,60188,Leadership at the University of Illinois,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/22154.html,"March 22, 2012I write today to inform you that University of Illinois President Michael J. Hogan has tendered his resignation, and I have accepted it on behalf of the Board of Trustees. President Hogan will remain with the University as President through a transition period until July 1. President Hogan joined the University at a very challenging time, when it had just weathered a long and very public controversy around admissions and enrollment practices, had major gaps in the administrative team, and was under such significant financial constraint that furloughs and salary freezes were required. The Board sought out a reform-minded leader and was glad to find Mike Hogan, a veteran and accomplished educational leader with a distinguished record, who was committed to carrying out an exhaustive mandate of change with a sense of necessary urgency. We were not the only university pursuing him. Ultimately, he chose to lead the University of Illinois because of its reputation and his belief that he could make a difference.In his nearly two years as President, Mike accomplished a great deal, and the University owes him a debt of gratitude for moving a number of tough initiatives forward. Among the achievements:  the University netted more than $30 million in recurring annual savings through major administrative efficiencies that have been reallocated to support academic and research programs, offsetting declines in state funding and late payments from the state. He has successfully recruited a highly talented leadership team and implemented the first merit-based salary increase in three years. There have been no furlough days on his watch. During his tenure, state appropriations have remained essentially level, notwithstanding the state budget crisis.It has not been easy. Some of what Mike Hogan was compelled to do was not popular, but he did what this University needed over the past 20 months, and we thank him for his hard work, perseverance, and achievement. The Board feels that the most appropriate next step in university leadership should come from a proven administrator with a track record of collaboration and success within our University. On Friday, the Executive Committee of the Board will meet to appoint long-time University of Illinois leader Robert Easter to assume the role of president-designate. Bob stepped up for this university in some of our toughest days, as interim chancellor immediately following the disappointing and disruptive days of 2009, and he repaired and rebuilt the campus both literally and figuratively. Bob started at the U. of I. as a doctoral student, and then 36 years ago, as a faculty member. He was dean of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences before acting as interim provost and then interim chancellor, then retiring, just briefly, last October. He came back again and currently serves as interim vice chancellor for research on the Urbana campus. Dr. Easter views this University as a great educator of students and a research powerhouse destined to fulfill our land-grant mission though new ideas that create businesses, jobs and new taxes to benefit the state. He has the trust of alumni and trustees past and present, as well as faculty, administrators and staff, and always, the best interest of students at heart. Following a transition period, he will be president beginning July 1. The Board joins me in wishing Mike well and in welcoming Bob back to play another key role for our beloved University of Illinois. Sincerely,Christopher G. KennedyChairman, Board of Trustees"

Both the Stewarding Excellence Report (http://oc.illinois.edu/budget/projectteams.html#itatillinois) and the Administrative Review and Restructuring Report (http://www.uillinois.edu/arr/) point out an opportunity to improve our research capacity and competitiveness while decreasing total cost of research computing through the creation of a consolidated research computing cluster.In support of this, the Campus Cluster Program (http://campuscluster.illinois.edu/) was initiated and in the past year we deployed the first instance of the Campus Cluster called Taub. This first instance is intended to be the first in a series of research computing resource deployments. Researchers are responsible only for investing in compute resources, storage, and specialized software licenses. As a result, researchers are able to:  * acquire up to 20% more resources with their available funding;  * allow faculty, research staff and graduate students to focus on their research and not be distracted with the responsibility of operating these resources;  * have the resources managed by a professional team providing support for security patches, attempted hacks, operating system upgrades, and hardware repair, operations and support;  * leverage university-supported infrastructure such as networking, racks, floor space, cooling, and power; and  * leverage the Campus Cluster Program staff efforts in working with vendors to obtain the best price for computing resources by pooling funds from different disciplines to leverage greater group purchasing power.As we continue to develop the Campus Cluster Program, we are collecting technical requirements for the next instance of the shared campus research cluster. To date, the first instance, Taub, has been quite successful and has been a very cost efficient solution for faculty with funds for investing in research computing resources. This survey is the primary mechanism by which we collect and understand the needs of the Illinois research community.For additional information about Taub and the Campus Cluster Program visit http://campuscluster.illinois.edu/"

I came to this University at a very challenging time -- on the heels of a public and protracted controversy around questionable admission and enrollment practices, 17 major leadership vacancies, and at a time of great fiscal constraint with no salary increases. A new Board rightly demanded reform, and my mandates have been clear from the beginning -- make the University more efficient and effective, be a rigorous steward of the precious resources we have, and recruit and retain the very best talent in the country.Collectively, we can be proud of our progress in all areas. Among them, an exceptionally talented leadership team on the campuses and University administration is being put in place. We have strategically reallocated funding to key mission areas, which has allowed us to recruit and rebuild faculty ranks. We've had the first general compensation package in three years and avoided furlough days, and our government relations efforts have strongly and effectively advocated our interests in Springfield and Washington, D.C. Disagreements have at times obscured our successes. While all sides agree on our missions, there has been discord over the best way to achieve our common goals. I will redouble my efforts to better communicate with all stakeholders as we weigh new initiatives and policies. Indeed, I intend to set regular meetings across our campuses to expand face-to-face dialog. This is a great University, and I want to play an important role in rebuilding its reputation. The University of Illinois and all who teach, work and study here deserve the best, and I will do all I can to restore integrity and trust.The contributions and dedication of the faculty and staff have made the University of Illinois a world leader in education and innovation. Working together, I am confident that we can ensure that our best days are still to come.Mike HoganPresidentUniversity of Illinois"

In some cases, instructors will need to indicate that a student never attended class. Detailed instructions for Banner grade entry will be provided in the next few days by the Office of the Registrar.  We recognize this new procedure will involve a bit more work on your part during the grade entry process and we very much appreciate your assistance.  We are all working to ensure that our campus is compliant with federal regulations for two financial aid programs that greatly assist our students.  See details below:Federal regulations associated with two important financial aid programs necessitate the collection of last date of attendance information for some students:Unofficial Withdrawal Requirement (34 CFR 668.22 (j) (2)): Federal Title IV funds are awarded to a student under the assumption that the student will attend school for the entire period for which the assistance is awarded. When a student withdraws, the student may no longer be eligible for the full amount of Title IV funds that was originally received.  If a student who began attendance and has not officially withdrawn fails to earn a passing grade in at least one course offered over an entire semester, the institution must assume, for Title IV purposes, that the student has unofficially withdrawn.Federal Pell Grant Attendance Requirement: Federal regulations require that a procedure be in place to know whether a student has begun attendance in all classes for purposes of the Federal Pell Grant Program.  A student is considered to have begun attendance in all of his or her classes if the student attends at least one day of class for each course in which the student's enrollment status was determined for Federal Pell Grant eligibility."

As such, students are asked to take responsibility for their behavior and its impact on others, particularly with respect to safety.  Unfortunately, in past years, the event has led to serious injuries and at least two deaths.We want to make it clear that the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign does not sponsor or sanction Unofficial St. Patrick's Day.  On that day, as on other days, the University responds to all violations of the Student Code, regardless of where the behavior occurs. Such violations include consuming alcohol as a minor, providing alcohol to minors, damage and destruction of property, dangerous activities like throwing items from balconies, and acts of physical violence and sexual aggression. The consequences for such violations will be assigned commensurate with the seriousness of the behavior. As a reminder, disciplinary records are subject to review in background checks by graduate schools and future employers. Students may be dismissed as a result of their dangerous behavior and irresponsible choices on Unofficial Saint Patrick's Day.  At the University, students who host guests will be held to account for negative consequences incurred by their guests, with respect to property damage or threats to others' safety.  If a guest is cited or arrested for illegal activity, the University will forward this information to any college or University where that guest may be enrolled for disciplinary action.  According to the police, this year students who hold parties at which minors are served will incur misdemeanor criminal charges rather than simple ordinance violations.  Hosts found serving or allowing minors to possess alcohol or charging admission will be arrested on state charges and transported to the Champaign County Jail.  Given the serious consequences that could occur, we strongly urge you to choose responsible behavior and ask that you look out for the safety of yourselves and others.  Sincerely,C. Rene Romano        Vice Chancellor for Student AffairsKenneth T. BallomDean of Students"

While the University does not support or condone this event, steps are being taken to ensure safety and to minimize disruption to classes and campus operations.The Champaign, Urbana, and University of Illinois police departments, assisted by other local and state agencies, will patrol the campus district on March 2. They will enforce all applicable ordinances in commercial and residential areas, and have authority to intervene if private parties threaten to disturb the peace. In addition, Champaign and Urbana officials will enact restrictions on liquor sales intended to curb overconsumption. Emergency medical personnel will be available to provide care.University police will continue to focus on protecting students, staff, faculty, and University property. In case of emergency, call METCAD at 911 (from campus phones, call 9-911). For non-emergencies, call 333-1216.As in years past, we have made clear to students that academic business will continue as usual on Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. That has helped to minimize disruptions. Instructors should not need to alter instructional plans.The Student Code http://www.admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/ addresses student responsibilities on campus. Sections 1-102(d) and 1-302(f) concern classroom conduct expectations, and section 1-307 focuses on alcohol consumption. The Code empowers instructors to ask disruptive students to leave class; after class, names of disruptive students should be reported to the Office for Student Conflict Resolution at 333-3680 or online at http://www.conflictresolution.illinois.edu/forms/incidentReport/form.asp.If asking a disruptive student to leave class could escalate into a confrontation, you may seek assistance. From 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on March 2, teams of Student Affairs and Academic Affairs professionals will walk through and around buildings with classrooms and lecture halls where disruptions were experienced in the past. Team members, wearing University IDs, may be summoned to help. Teams will be prepared to document apparent Code violations and to call University police, if necessary.Students will be asked not to bring any liquids into Foellinger Auditorium. (Longstanding policy prohibits liquids and food in Foellinger.)Students who interfere with the academic mission of the University will face serious consequences.

2012-01-31T05:11:00Z,2012-01-31,5:11,63379,Taxation Withholding Method Applied to Graduate-level...,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/20439.html,"In accordance with the University of Illinois' Educational Assistance Plan that is in compliance with Internal Revenue Code Section 127, the value of graduate-level educational benefits exceeding $5,250 is subject to employment taxes and must be reported as taxable wages on Form W-2.   This taxation does not apply to qualified Teaching Assistants or Research Assistants.  The University must withhold federal and state income taxes, as well as Social Security and Medicare taxes, if applicable, on taxable tuition waivers, as required by the IRS and other regulatory agencies.  Effective January 1, 2012, federal and state income taxes will be withheld at graduated rates on taxable tuition waiver amounts in excess of $5,250.  The calculation of the tax withholding will be in accordance with the employee's current Form W-4 on file with the University Payroll & Benefits (UPB) Office.  Individuals may change their Form W-4 via NESSIE (https://nessie.uihr.uillinois.edu/cf/comp/index.cfm?Item_id=1056&rlink=674) to adjust their withholding.  Also, Monthly- and Bi-weekly Tuition Benefit Net Pay Calculators are available to employees on the OBFS website to assist in determining the effect of the withholding on their pay.  The calculators are located at http://www.obfs.uillinois.edu/payroll/ on the right hand side of the page. Due to the change from the supplemental to the graduated tax withholding rates, the following process changes will occur within University Payroll Benefits:- If a tuition waiver amount needs to be applied outside of regular pay cycle processing due to an employee being in an inactive pay status (i.e., leave of absence or termination), the supplemental withholding rate will be assessed on the transaction.  - All corrections will be processed on the next regularly scheduled tuition waiver assessment period.  Any approved exceptions for adjustments outside the normal tuition waiver process will be applied on the next regular payroll cycle.  The change to the graduated rates applies ONLY to tuition waivers.  All other taxable benefits will continue to be taxed at the supplemental withholding rate (25% Federal, 5% State, 1.45% Medicare, and 4.2%, pending federal legislation, for Social Security where applicable).  During the Spring of 2012, UPB will conduct overview sessions with more detailed information related to the taxation of tuition waivers.  Additional communications will be forthcoming.  Questions regarding the new process can be addressed to UPB Customer Service at payinq@uillinois.edu or by calling one of these offices:  UIUC 217-265-6363, UIC 312-996-7200, UIS 217-206-7211."

2012-01-12T10:42:00Z,2012-01-12,10:42,61630,Ice and Snow Removal on the Urbana-Champaign Campus,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/19925.html,"TO: All Faculty, Staff and StudentsFROM: Jack Dempsey, Executive Director of Facilities & ServicesDATE: January 12, 2012RE: Ice and Snow RemovalWith the arrival of winter, some amount of snow and ice can be expected. During snow and ice events, Facilities & Services (F&S) will work diligently to keep the campus open and accessible for students, faculty, and staff. Typically, it takes a few days to complete snow removal after a 'normal two-inch snow.' Crews will work as quickly as possible to clear the building entrances, streets, lots, and sidewalks. However, aggravating factors such as wind, snow density, icing, and campus occupancy can add to the time necessary to complete the job.As in previous years, priority is given to handicapped spaces, food service docks, McKinley Health Center, Veterinary Medicine facilities and other critical areas. Also, ADA entrances will be cleared edge to edge while other building entrances will be cleared the width of the entryway. Roads and emergency routes take priority over parking lots. If your assigned parking areas are not accessible in a snow emergency, please use designated emergency lots and the MTD. (For Additional Information see 'Where to Park During a Snow Event' at www.parking.illinois.edu) Parking in unplowed lots further complicates and delays snow removal efforts.Campus snow removal is a carefully planned, cooperative effort involving multiple F&S crews and the cities of Champaign and Urbana. We will make every effort to keep the campus community updated during snow events. Your patience and consideration are appreciated while crews do their best to clear snow and ice this winter."

2011-12-22T05:04:00Z,2011-12-22,5:4,13010,New EmailTravel and Expense Management (TEM) System,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/19605.html,"The Office of Business and Financial Services (OBFS) is pleased to announce the implementation of a new on-line system for processing travel and other employee reimbursements and certain other payments.  The Travel and Expense Management (TEM) system has been in pilot phase for two months and will be rolling out to all employees and all units of the University with a target completion date of June 1, 2012.  Individuals and units that currently request travel or miscellaneous reimbursements or are responsible for managing travel budget and miscellaneous invoice payments will be using this new electronic system. TEM is a web-based system that can be accessed from anywhere at any time for the purpose of submitting, approving, and tracking requests for employee travel and miscellaneous reimbursements, any department-required pre-trip approvals, and non-purchase order payments to vendors.  Built-in logic regarding state travel rules will speed up the process and lead to more error-free submissions.  A new University travel card (T-Card) will be rolled out with the TEM system and will be available to a limited number of qualified employees, as approved by their units, who travel frequently.  By using the T-Card, employees will be able to limit out-of-pocket travel related expenses.  An OBFS representative will contact each department approximately six to eight weeks before their implementation date to provide internal communication, system demonstrations, training options, Travel Card (T-Card) process information, and other implementation support.  The department's Unit Security Contact (USC) will work with each employee for access to the system.  For additional information about TEM, go to the OBFS website http://www.obfs.uillinois.edu and select the TEM Resource Page link listed under Business Travel or Payments."
2011-12-19T09:19:00Z,2011-12-19,9:19,61575,An Important Unified Communications Update,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/19468.html,"Dear Colleagues,CITES and ATAG ( http://www.cites.illinois.edu/uc/atag.html ) would like to make an announcement regarding the UC Project.Recently we were informed by our telephone service provider that the thirty thousand temporary phone numbers required during the UC bridge period would not be available until February.  Without these temporary phone numbers, campus users would not have the option to fully test the new Lync phone system during the bridge period.  After this was immediately brought to the attention of ATAG, the committee reinforced their commitment to ensuring that the ease of transition for campus users was a high priority.Thus, ATAG decided to change the bridge period activation date from January 9, 2012 to February 13, 2012.  This will still allow campus users to test and acquaint themselves with the new Lync phone system for more than three months before the old phone system is removed.  Also, this does not change the overall project timeline as we are committed to our goal of providing campus with innovative technology to support teaching and research, while also saving costs for our university through an expeditious rollout of Unified Communications.Details about the Unified Communications Bridge Period can be found here:http://cites.illinois.edu/uc/uc-bridge.htmlIf you have any questions or concerns, please contact CITES at consult@illinois.edu or 217-244-7000.We would like to thank campus for the partnership you have already shown throughout the first phase of this project, and we look forward to completing this roll-out so that campus can truly experience the full benefits of Unified Communications.Sincerely,The UC Program Office"
2011-12-15T05:11:00Z,2011-12-15,5:11,61596,Our responsibilities,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/19350.html,"Dear Faculty, Staff and Students:We are all saddened and shocked by the developments this past fall at Pennsylvania State University (PSU) regarding alleged sexual abuse by PSU personnel on university property.  As I conveyed at the 12/2/2011 meeting of the Board of Trustees, our first commitment must be to the safety and well-being of all members of our community and visitors to our campuses.  An important aspect of living up to this commitment is meeting our moral and legal responsibilities to report observations or information related to criminal behavior or misconduct.With this in mind, I remind you that any member of the University community who witnesses criminal behavior, including sexual abuse or violence, by a University employee, or any person who has access to University premises, should report it to law enforcement officials immediately.  It's also the ethical duty of University employees to report any such behavior to a supervisor, higher-level administrator, and/or to the University Ethics Office.  These reporting responsibilities apply equally to all, regardless of title, status, or seniority.  Students should also follow these guidelines, reporting such behavior to administrators or to the University Ethics Office.  The University Ethics Office can be contacted via the toll-free help line at 1-866-758-2146.  Additionally, the University has an explicit policy in place, known as the Whistleblower Policy, that can be invoked to respond to any alleged reprisal or retaliation that arises from the reporting of suspected wrongful conduct. U of I employees who make a good faith effort to report suspected wrongful conduct are protected.  See 'Disclosure of Wrongful Conduct and Protection from Reprisal Policy' at http://www.ethics.uillinois.edu/policies/whistle.cfm.Also at the 12/2 meeting of the Board of Trustees, I announced that we would be reviewing our policies and procedures related to how we respond to observations or reports of criminal behavior or misconduct.  This review will be coordinated by Thomas R. Bearrows, chief University Counsel; Donna McNeely, University Ethics Officer; and Maureen Parks, Executive Director of Human Resources.  The team will examine state and federal laws, along with our own policies and procedures involving situations of alleged crimes or misconduct, and they'll also examine situations in which background checks for employees may be appropriate.  They have already begun their work and will make regular progress reports to me and to our Board of Trustees.As part of this initiative, the University is also strengthening its sexual harassment awareness program for employees. It is important for all employees to understand the law in this regard, as well as the expectations for appropriate workplace behavior.  We will keep you apprised as these plans are developed.I remain impressed by the level of compassion, acts of kindness, and genuine sense of community I observe everyday on our campuses.  One of our greatest virtues of any community is the sense of responsibility for one another and this is a virtue that is already strong among us, but one we can always strengthen more.I look forward to updating you on the review team's work.Sincerely,MikeMichael J. HoganPresidentUniversity of Illinois"

Applications from the units listed below -- which represent longstanding humanities units on our campus -- are particularly welcome. All applicants must make clear the humanistic focus and contributions of their work. It is appreciated, however that humanistic endeavors are broad and various. In this regard, applicants might find the following statement from the 1965 National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act helpful (of course, humanities research at the University of Illinois is not bound by the confines of '[our] national life'):The term 'humanities' includes, but is not limited to, the study of the following: language, both modern and classical; linguistics; literature; history; jurisprudence; philosophy; archaeology; comparative religion; ethics; the history, criticism and theory of the arts; those aspects of social sciences which have humanistic content and employ humanistic methods; and the study and application of the humanities to the human environment with particular attention to reflecting our diverse heritage, traditions, conditions of national life.HRT applications must be accompanied by a letter of support from the departmental executive officer. The letter must indicate two things: (1) That the department is willing to exempt faculty members from a semester of teaching in the subsequent AY (they will be compensated $12,000 for releasing the faculty member); and (2) That the faculty member would otherwise not have access to this sort of semester-long release time from teaching.  The letter can be uploaded on the application in the supplemental documentation section or a pdf of the letter can be emailed to kdfrazie@illinois.edu or the original can be mailed to Kelley Frazier, 404 Swanlund Administration Building, MC 304.HRT applications can no longer be accompanied by additional funding requests to the Research Board.  The applicant will receive $2,000 for unrestricted expenses associated with the project and within the normal Research Board guidelines.  Applicants are welcome, however, to submit requests for research related to the release time at later Research Board deadlines.African StudiesAfrican American StudiesAmerican Indian StudiesAnthropologyAsian American StudiesArt HistoryArchitectural & Landscape HistoryUnit for Cinema StudiesClassicsProgram in Comparative LiteratureUnit for Criticism and Interpretive TheoryDivision of English as an International LanguageEnglishEast Asian Languages and CulturesFrenchGender and Women's StudiesGermanic Languages and LiteraturesHistoryLanguage Learning LaboratoryLinguisticsLatin American StudiesLatina/Latino StudiesMedieval StudiesMusicologyPhilosophyProgram for the Study of ReligionRussian, East European, & Eurasia StudiesSlavic Languages and LiteraturesSouth Asian & Middle Eastern StudiesSpanish, Italian and PortugueseSpeech CommunicationTheatre History"

2011-11-30T13:03:00Z,2011-11-30,13:3,14210,Good News on Survey Funding,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/18772.html,"Dear Faculty and Staff,I'm pleased to share with you another bit of good news from Springfield.  We learned Tuesday evening that our Prairie Research Institute was approved for funding by the General Assembly during this week's veto session. This is outstanding news.  You may recall that the Institute was excluded in the Spring budget decisions in Springfield, leaving us with a nearly $16 million gap in the budget of our Urbana-Champaign campus.  This important restoration of funding assures that the Institute will continue its valued contribution to the state, without danger of a reduction in forces. It means that the good work it does, the millions of additional dollars it brings to Illinois, and the many jobs it generates will be ongoing.We owe great thanks to our friends, supporters, and legislators, especially Senator Mike Frerichs, and other legislators who supported us in promoting the importance of the Institute, which houses the Illinois Scientific Surveys (Water Survey, Geological Survey, Archaeological Survey, Natural History Survey, and Illinois Sustainable Technology Center).  I also want to give special thanks to the Illinois Connection, whose thousands of members advocated in support of funding the Institute.  It's clear that they are making a big difference in helping generate support for the University.Dr. Bill Shilts, Executive Director of the Institute, played a key role in informing our legislators about the Institute's importance and the value it brings to the State.  I'm grateful for the time, effort, and expertise he lent to our efforts.Throughout the last several months, our outstanding Governmental Relations team, led by Kappy Laing, has been working hard to secure this funding.  Kappy, DeShana Forney, and Diana Barrows worked tirelessly with me and others to convey to legislators across the state the important work of the Institute as well as the revenues and jobs it generates.  The Institute is a point of pride for the University and we're grateful that it's being recognized with this continued funding.In this case, as with a few other items, like our procurement bill, we aren't quite out of the woods yet.  The Governor will still need to sign this legislation into law.  I can assure you that our Governmental Relations team and I will continue to press to have these important bills signed and we will continue to work hard in Springfield and in Washington DC to protect and advance the future of our great University.As we look back over our shoulders at the Thanksgiving holiday, we truly do have a great deal to be thankful for.  We've experienced tremendous support and success, owing to the hard work of all of you and the continued bounties you bring to the University and the state.  Thank you and good wishes to you and yours as we enter the holiday season.Sincerely,MikeMichael J. HoganPresidentUniversity of Illinois"
