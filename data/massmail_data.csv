        Dear Colleagues,As we finalize our review of applications for undergraduate admission for the Fall 2024 semester, in cooperation with the Senate Committee on Admissions, we would like to remind you of the university policies regarding admissions confidentiality and third-party inquiries. Admissions officers may discuss a student’s application only with the applicant, the applicant’s parents/legal guardian, spouse or school-appointed counselor. Other individuals, including university employees without admissions responsibilities, are not permitted to inquire about a student’s application with a university admissions officer, and admissions officers are prohibited from sharing information with third parties regarding a student’s application.A university admissions officer is considered anyone with admissions responsibility. This includes not only admissions staff in central admissions units such as the Office of Undergraduate Admissions and the Graduate College, but also faculty and staff within academic college and departmental offices responsible for reviewing and making decision recommendations for applicants. A firewall has been placed around faculty, administrators and admissions staff with admissions responsibility so that those without admissions responsibility may not influence decisions.Unsolicited letters of recommendation or emails of support or appeal are not accepted or considered in our processes. Please review this Summary of University of Illinois Admissions Firewall Practices for a complete list of inquiries that are and are not permitted, as well as examples of scenarios and appropriate responses.At the graduate level, it is important to note that those with admissions responsibility are allowed to accept information from an applicant’s recommenders in the form of formal letters, emails and phone communications; however, they may not discuss the applicant’s admission status with the recommender. If they are contacted about an applicant’s admission status by a recommender, they are to notify the recommender that while they may accept supporting information for the applicant’s file, they may not discuss the applicant’s admission status without expressed written permission from the applicant. Also at the graduate level, the Graduate College discourages any discussions with an applicant’s parent and/or spouse regarding the applicant’s status without the written permission from the applicant.Inappropriate activities or attempts to circumvent these policies should be reported to the Ethics Officer or reported anonymously using the anonymous report feature of the Admissions Inquiry Log.Thank you for helping to protect the integrity of our admissions process.Sincerely,Doug BurgettInterim Director of Undergraduate AdmissionsDirector of Marketing and CommunicationsElizabeth SparkAssistant Dean for Admissions, Registration, and Enrollment ServicesGraduate College"

        Dear Students and Employees,The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug Free Workplace Act and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act require the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Alcohol and Drug Prevention and Response Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, cannabis (marijuana) is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of cannabis on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to cannabis in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s cannabis prohibition.The university’s cannabis prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical cannabis registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess cannabis on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.The university’s Alcohol and Drug Prevention and Response Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Alcohol and Drug Prevention and Response Program website.Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. University employees should contact Illinois Human Resources at (217) 333-2137.Sincerely,Danita M. Brown YoungVice Chancellor for Student Affairs"

        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,With a wintery mix of sleet, freezing rain and ice accumulation expected to worsen tonight and continue into the early morning hours, we are recommending these changes in class schedules and activities for tonight and tomorrow morning. For Tonight (Monday):We recommend instructors move in-person classes and activities scheduled for this evening to a remote learning format if possible. We recommend cancelling/rescheduling any non-academic activities tonight to minimize the number of people out in potentially dangerous conditions.All University Libraries will close at 5 p.m. tonight and will reopen at noon on Tuesday. For Tuesday:We recommend instructors move in-person classes to a remote-learning format until noon Tuesday if possible. We recommend cancelling/rescheduling any other non-academic activities until after noon on Tuesday. This delayed start will allow university and city crews sufficient time to clear streets, sidewalks and parking lots of any remaining ice from the overnight accumulation.Instructors should inform their students of any change in class format for tonight or tomorrow as quickly as possible. Students should contact your instructors or your department if you are unsure of your class status tonight through noon tomorrow.While university facilities are expected to maintain their regular operating hours tonight and tomorrow, that could change if conditions deteriorate. You should verify facilities are open as usual before you attempt to visit.As a reminder, the residential and research aspects of our operations make closing impossible, so staff members are expected to fulfill their regular work responsibilities. Extreme weather does not change the need for an individual employee to notify their supervisor of the absence. Normal leave reporting processes and requirements apply to leave used to cover weather-related absences. For additional information, please refer to guidelines from Illinois Human Resources.  Our Facilities & Services crews are working through the night to keep campus streets and walkways clear of ice, but whether on foot or driving, you should proceed with caution on and off campus until tomorrow’s rain and higher temperatures clear the ice. We encourage you to refer to current information from the National Weather Service website as you engage in your planned activities tonight and tomorrow. And students who need warm weather essentials can contact the Student Assistance Center for Basic Needs at (217) 333-0050 or basicneeds@illinois.edu.We will continue to monitor the weather throughout the night, and we will be prepared to reevaluate our operational plans if conditions are significantly worse than predicted.

        Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,Welcome back and I hope you had a safe and restful break. We open our new semester on the same day that we celebrate the life and contributions of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. I hope you will be able to attend one or more of the services throughout the area.I also hope the spirit of hope, peace, justice and optimism so many of us will commemorate today will serve as a point of inspiration for how we choose to speak and act toward one another this semester.We are just weeks beyond the 59-year anniversary of Dr. King’s acceptance of his 1964 Nobel Peace Prize. It was against the backdrop of a devastating international conflict that was already dividing the world. Racial segregation and discrimination continued to deprive millions of rights and opportunities here at home. Public demonstrations brought physical and philosophical conflict. Violence, hatred and anger seemed to be the rule of the day.In that moment he accepted this award for peace in a world that seemed to have none of that commodity, Dr. King chose to speak of optimism. There are three phrases in particular that resonate with me as we seem surrounded by many of the same challenges today. I know these sentences are taken out of context from the speech and I do not imply that my use of them is how Dr. King intended them in his own delivery. But I do wish they might inspire us all to find our way more often to a path of empathy, tolerance and personal respect even as we navigate intense disagreement.   “I accept this award today with an abiding faith in America and an audacious faith in the future of mankind.”“I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality.”“I have the audacity to believe that peoples everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, and dignity, equality and freedom for their spirits.”I quote Dr. King’s words of optimism today because I recognize the reality of the weeks and months ahead. There will certainly be intense disagreements, debates, uncomfortable discussions and public demonstrations around any number of significant issues that are extremely important to different members of our community. We will not all be on the same side of any given issue, and we may very well personally dislike some of those who take an opposing view. But this university must remain a place where free speech, free expression and academic freedom allow for the open exploration of ideas and for the questioning of opposing opinions and differing perspectives. In fact, free speech and academic freedom are most critical and most essential to a university like ours when the topics of discussion truly impact the way members of our community live, work and engage.  I want to also be very clear that expressions of hate, intimidation, calls for violence against others or actions that threaten the health and safety of members of our community are antithetical to our university values, and those who act in ways contrary to these will be held accountable. The safety of ALL members of our university community is always our priority.Welcome back to Illinois. I wish you a safe and productive new semester, and I hope you will join me in sharing Dr. King’s audacity of belief that we can find a welcome light of dignity, equality and freedom of spirit together.Sincerely, Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,I am pleased to share with you that Matt Ballinger will become the executive director of public safety and chief of police. His appointment will begin Feb. 1 pending approval by the Board of Trustees. The title until officially approved will be interim executive director of public safety and chief of police. Ballinger has served as the interim executive director of public safety and chief of police since Oct. 2023. He was initially hired as a police officer with the University of Illinois Police Department in 2004. Over his nearly 20-year tenure with the university, he has garnered public recognition for his outstanding contributions to safety and service.Aside from being deeply rooted within our university community, Ballinger brings a very clear understanding of 21st century policing, overseeing programs that promote relationship building, community outreach and support for mental health and wellness. His strong police work, administrative experience and knowledge of our university have helped form strong partnerships across the university and local community.I want to thank the search committee for their diligent and thoughtful work throughout the entire search process. I also want to thank the entire Division of Public Safety for their service year after year.  There is no higher priority for us than ensuring that our university community is as safe as possible for our students, faculty, staff and visitors. I am excited to have Matt Ballinger lead that effort for us.Sincerely, Mike DeLorenzoVice Chancellor for Administration and Operations"

        Dear campus community member,The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is continuously planning to keep you safe in the event of emergencies or natural disasters. To maintain an effective emergency response and evacuation plan, we recently completed a test including two components: a drill and an exercise. We are informing you of these efforts so you have more information about our plans to protect you in the event of an emergency, and to comply with disclosure mandates set forth in the federal Clery Act.On Nov. 29, first responders from police, fire and emergency medical services representing multiple agencies in our community gathered for a functional exercise at the Advanced Computation Building. Participants were presented with a hypothetical scenario involving an active shooter attack affecting the campus, and then were asked to react and make decisions as they would during a real-life event. The exercise tested various components of the Campus Emergency Operations Plan, including evacuation procedures. On Dec. 5, university leadership gathered virtually and were presented with response actions and challenges from the Nov. 29 exercise. This follow-up scenario determined the university’s decision-making priorities and procedures for this type of event.Also on Dec. 5, we initiated a test of our Illini-Alert emergency notification system. The drill was announced ahead of time by a mass email to campus and in Eweek, GradLinks and I-News bulletin notifications to students, faculty and staff. The Illini-Alert system sent an email to all active campus email users. Those who have registered alternate email addresses or mobile numbers also received messages sent to their preferred medium.Illini-Alert messages are also posted to X (formerly Twitter) and digital signage throughout campus buildings. This approach increases the speed and breadth of our distribution of emergency notifications, and it provides alternate notification methods that will continue to function even if one system fails to work properly.This two-component test is conducted annually to ensure that we have a robust response plan in the event of a campus emergency, that first responders are prepared to react quickly and decisively, and that our notifications will reach you in a timely and effective manner.If you have not signed up to receive Illini-Alert text messages, please visit emergency.illinois.edu to register.To view the university’s emergency response and evacuation procedures, please visit go.illinois.edu/EmergencyResponse.The Division of Public Safety is committed to maintaining a safe and secure campus environment where education, research and public service can flourish. We can only do so with the assistance of our community, and we hope this information is useful to our campus partners.Sincerely,Brian R. BrauerExecutive Director of Emergency Management"

It is a day dedicated to acknowledging the sacrifices made, the challenges faced, and the unwavering dedication of our veterans to make us safe and free.As an institution, we embrace and support our employees and students for their military service and are working to build a more vibrant and empowering veteran community. We recognize that the transition from active service to civilian life in higher education can be challenging and we work to assist veterans in this journey. We shape our policies to be inclusive of veteran’s needs, provide academic advising and counseling services to promote success and adjustment, promote inclusive design for campus facilities, provide networking opportunities specifically for veterans, and provide financial aid and scholarships tailored to veteran needs.On our campus, hundreds of current employees and students have served or continue to serve. Each veteran has a unique and deeply personal narrative, defined by acts of bravery, unwavering determination, and selfless sacrifice. We encourage all veterans to self-identify; for employees follow these steps and students can fill out this form. Knowing who our veterans are helps our institution in providing assistance, support, and resources to you.  The university joins the nation, on Veterans Day and every day, to offer our utmost respect and recognition for the contributions of our veterans and their families, caregivers, and survivors have made to the cause of freedom and safety around the world. Thank you for your service.   If you have any questions or require assistance, please do not hesitate to contact the Chez Veterans Center, Illinois Human Resources, or the Office for Access and Equity.  Shari Mickey-BoggsSenior Associate Chancellor for Human ResourcesDanita M.

This time of year always demonstrates our generous hearts and kind compassion through giving here at Illinois.There are still three days left to join your colleagues and coworkers across campus to make a contribution to non-profit organizations here, in our state and around the world. The campaign will close at the end of the workday on November 15, so you still have time to make a one-time gift or enroll in the automatic payroll deduction. It only takes a few minutes and can easily be done by following this link.With all the turmoil in the world and challenges our economy is facing, I am humbled by those who have chosen to contribute toward a multitude of charitable causes. This selfless act has allowed us to surpass the $1 million mark. What a tremendous achievement!Finally, I offer a special thanks to the approximately 200 unit and section leaders who have served as liaisons between their colleges or departments and the CCFD staff to provide the support and motivation that has made this campaign a success.

        Dear Colleagues,I am delighted to open the 2023 – 2024 Chancellor's Staff Excellence Award (CSEA) Program. You may recall that we successfully adopted a single program for all staff last year with one set of rules and protocols to recognize and reward exemplary staff service, establishing university-wide visibility. This supports campus efforts in fostering one staff community between Academic Professionals and Civil Service employees.The CSEA Program recognizes the importance of the outstanding work of all university staff members who perform a wide range of critical functions for our university. Staff provide crucial administrative support, support our research laboratories and education programs, serve our students and offer important outreach programs throughout the state and beyond.Sixteen awards will be distributed based on eight functional categories (up to two awards per category). Nominees are evaluated on four criteria, all of which are located on the award website here. Each winner of the CSEA Award will be honored at a reception, where they will receive a $1,500 award (after taxes) and a commemorative plaque.The deadline for submitting nominations to the CSEA nomination website is Monday, January 8, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. If there are questions, please email ihr-pso-csea@illinois.edu.Thank you for your continued support of all employees on our campus and your willingness to help honor their accomplishments.Sincerely,Robert J.

        Dear Members of the University Community,   The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign believes in creating an academic community that celebrates and supports the identities, cultures, faiths and perspectives of all members of our university community. Achieving this goal requires creating opportunities for thoughtful, honest feedback on our successes as well as identifying areas for further improvement.  As part of that effort, I would like to announce the All Campus Climate Assessment. This assessment is part of a multi-university initiative with the University of Minnesota and Rutgers University that brings together expertise from ten campuses. This effort, organized by members of the Chief Diversity Officers group of the Big Ten Academic Alliance, will allow us to share thematic concerns that emerge at our three universities, as well as identify data-informed approaches to build a more inclusive, dynamic, and welcoming environment for all.   The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign assessment will begin with a short campuswide survey. The purpose of this survey is to take the temperature of our campus climate at this moment in time, so we can better understand the perspectives, attitudes and individual experiences that affect a sense of belonging and inclusion at Illinois. This survey will take approximately 15 minutes to complete and is entirely voluntary. All responses will be strictly confidential and reported only in aggregate. Your name or email address will not be attached to your survey responses, and no one in your college, department or unit will have access to any individual data.    You can find more information about the survey at go.illinois.edu/AllCampusSurvey.  During the week of November 6, 2023, you will be asked to participate in the survey through an email invitation from SoundRocket, an external vendor who is administering this study for the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. SoundRocket is an independent survey organization based in Ann Arbor, MI, with a specialty in conducting web-based surveys in higher education settings and has been hired to safeguard your data.      If you do not have access to a computer during the workday, a paper questionnaire will be available at different locations during working hours beginning in late November. You will receive additional information about how you can complete the survey.   As we begin to implement our new strategic planning framework, understanding your experience at Illinois is critical. Your experiences matter. I encourage you to watch your email for the invitation to take this campus climate assessment from SoundRocket’s Research Director, Higher Education Studies, Joshua Patterson at surveys@srsrv.com.  Thank you for taking the time to provide the feedback we need to create a more inclusive university and strengthen the sense of belonging for everyone at Illinois.   Sincerely, Robert J. Jones Chancellor "

        Dear Faculty, Students and Staff,The Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel and the escalating war that is unfolding have already claimed a horrifying number of innocent lives with a toll that will only grow higher. Members of our university family have been directly impacted by these events and many more are certainly struggling as they try to make some sense of unimaginable tragedies. We have been and will continue to provide support for those impacted by the violence.But what we cannot support during this divisive period are calls for increasing conflict or for harm to others. Our campus has been a public gathering point for several protests, rallies and vigils. And while most have been peaceful, we know of instances over the past couple of weeks, including this past weekend, where actions and words of some participants were seen as calls for violence. Expressions of antisemitism or Islamophobia or hatred and harm against any individual or groups are antithetical to our university values. We are a university that prides itself on its efforts to foster inclusion and respect, and we condemn these messages that are contrary to our mutual values of inclusion and tolerance.  As this war continues, our campus will certainly be a gathering point for more public activities for our faculty, staff and students, as well as community members, who want their voices to be heard. We embrace that role as a public institution. But we will never tolerate hate, discrimination or violence. And we condemn and reject abhorrent expressions that threaten our ability to create a safe and healthy learning and work environment.The days and weeks to come will bring with them sad news about many more innocent lives lost. I ask that we keep all of those who are grieving, have been lost or are suffering in our hearts and minds.We are at our best when we bring empathy and compassion to our work together.Sincerely,Robert J. JonesChancellor"

The unspeakable brutality of the Hamas terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians is simply horrifying. Such acts can never be justified and we condemn them in the strongest possible terms.We have listened to our students and other members of our University of Illinois System community who are clearly hurting, and they are our first priority. Our three universities have ensured that support is readily available to students, staff and faculty who may be in need.As the conflict continues, additional innocent individuals will be injured or killed in both Israel and Gaza. We are gravely concerned for Israelis and Palestinians who have been and may now be in harm’s way. Though we may be located half a world away geographically, many of you will be carrying heavy burdens in the days to come.Our universities will continue to provide support, resources and safety measures for our community. University counseling and mental health services are there for all of you. Teams stand ready to help – please see links below.We are not in a position to affect the progression of the conflict or the outcome. However, we can decide as a community that we will support and care for one another, and we can recommit to our deeply held belief that the multicultural communities that compose our universities are our greatest strength. We are one University of Illinois System community and - at our best - we bring empathy and compassion to our work together.It remains our fervent hope that people of good will work together to provide for lasting and just peace in the region.Tim KilleenPresidentUniversity of Illinois SystemMarie Lynn MirandaChancellorUniversity of Illinois ChicagoJanet GoochChancellorUniversity of Illinois SpringfieldRobert JonesChancellorUniversity of Illinois Urbana-ChampaignSupport Resources: StudentsUrbana | Student Assistance Center or (217) 333-0050 helpdean@illinois.eduUIC | Student Assistance Center or (312) 996-4857; dos@uic.edu UIS | Counseling Center Support Resources: Faculty and StaffEmployee Assistance Programs"

        Dear campus community member:The Division of Public Safety has received numerous communications about bicycles and scooters traveling the wrong way on one-way streets, pedestrians disobeying signals or walking in the street, and motorists driving aggressively or not allowing at least three feet of space while passing bicyclists.These traffic violations have directly resulted in several accidents since the beginning of this semester, with a number of those resulting in serious injury. In response, the University of Illinois Police Department has increased enforcement of traffic laws as an effort to remind people about safe ways to use the road. We will continue to do so, and we will use this as an opportunity for traffic safety education.Traffic accidents are among the most common ways that our community members get physically injured on campus, which is why we take this issue so seriously. We implore our community members to follow these steps:Review resources provided by the Illinois Secretary of State regarding safe driving, bicycle rules of the road, bicycle safety tips and Scott’s Law.Share the road. Everyone has a right to use roadways. Always be courteous and give each other space.When operating in the roadway, electric and non-electric bicycles and electric scooters are required to follow the same laws as vehicles, like obeying traffic signals, stop signs, and using one-way streets in the correct direction.Pedestrians must stay attentive, obeying traffic signals as well as walking directions and street markings. Do not cross streets diagonally unless street markings allow it. Keep your eyes up and be aware of who and what is around you.Do not text or otherwise use your cell phone while driving, biking, using a skateboard or walking across a street.Use the appropriate safety equipment for your mode of transportation, including seatbelts, helmets and lights.Move over and slow down for emergency vehicles. Illinois law requires you to change to a lane away from emergency workers when safe to do so. If you cannot change lanes, you must slow down.Drive, ride and walk defensively. Do not assume that another person will obey the laws.This part of the year is a peak time for people to be outdoors on campus – particularly on bicycles, on scooters and as pedestrians. While we enjoy the ability to use all kinds of transportation modes on our campus, it is imperative that we do so safely, considerately and legally.Sincerely,Matt BallingerInterim Executive Director of Public Safety and Chief of Police"

        Dear students, faculty and staff: On July 3, we informed you that the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) was among many organizations targeted by a global ransomware attack. The attack exploited a vulnerability in a software product widely used to transfer data files. NSC is a nonprofit and nongovernmental organization founded by and extensively used by the higher education community to carry out the functions of student enrollment and degree verification reporting. At the time we informed you about the NSC attack, we did not know the extent to which University of Illinois System students’ personal data had been obtained, but NSC assured us that they quickly closed down the unauthorized access by applying additional security measures at the software provider’s direction. Today, we have additional details to share resulting from our continued dialogue with NSC. That organization’s review of the files accessed in the attack found that the names and dates of birth of eight University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign students had been accessed, as well as the names and dates of birth of 11 University of Illinois Chicago students. Additionally, the intruders obtained the names of 92,274 Chicago, Springfield, and Urbana-Champaign students from NSC but none of their personal data fields were accessed.Some key points to keep in mind:NSC is contacting the 19 students whose dates of birth were accessed, offering additional support to protect them from unauthorized use of that data. NSC will notify these students directly.Experts tell us the other 92,274 students whose names were obtained are not at increased risk as result of that limited exposure.  Students who enrolled for the first time this fall in any of our three universities are not affected.While the vulnerability that enabled this incident was specific and has been reported extensively in the news media, other risks present themselves more subtly and on a much smaller scale.We will continue to inform you of incidents that rise to this magnitude, but it is a good reminder to maintain a high level of vigilance in protecting university resources and in safely managing your personal business. We strongly encourage you to fully engage in the extensive cybersecurity training provided by the University of Illinois System, and we remind you below of some simple steps you can take to protect your identity.Thank you, and best wishes for a safe, secure, and spectacular fall semester!Sincerely,Nicholas P.

        Dear Members of the University Community,Building on recent efforts to continue support for first-generation students, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has been designated a First Scholars Institution by the Center for First-generation Student Success, an initiative of NASPA (Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education) and The Suder Foundation.Illinois was one of 22 institutions named to the First Scholars 2023 cohort, the next level of recognition in the nation’s first program acknowledging higher education institutions for their commitment to first-generation student success. Across the entire First Scholars Network, over 350 institutions have been recognized. Collectively, they represent a community of professionals prepared to share evidence-based practices and resources, troubleshoot challenges, generate knowledge, and continue to advance the success of first-generation students across the United States. First Scholars is the third phase of the First Scholars Network and serves as the Center’s customized approach to intentional institutional transformation to advance student success. Illinois is the first university in the state of Illinois to achieve this designation, and we are pleased to announce that we have launched a national search for a new director of First-Generation Initiatives in the Office of Minority Student Affairs to help lead our first-generation student support services.“The Office of Minority Student Affairs (OMSA) is elated to be recognized for the second year in a row for its continual efforts to expand educational equity and success for first-generation, low-income, and an array of historically underserved student communities. My colleagues and I are excited to deepen our relationship with the outstanding higher education professionals within the First Scholars community. We look forward to networking, sharing our best practices, and learning new, evidence-based strategies which we can utilize to increase success for all Illinois students,” remarked Domonic Cobb, Assistant Vice Chancellor for Student Success, Inclusion & Belonging and former director of the Office of Minority Student Affairs (OMSA).“Our designation as a First Scholars Institution speaks to our dedication as a university to provide as much opportunity as we can, for as many people as we can,” said John Coleman, Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost. “The diversity of our community and the spirit of inclusion are true strengths of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. When students join us, we are committed to maximizing their potential for success by building support structures that are about the whole student, in and outside of the classroom.”As members of a First Scholars Institution, staff and faculty will work closely with the Center for First-generation Student Success to continue our commitment to improving experiences and advancing success for first-generation college students.

        Dear campus community member:Each year around this time, we publish our Annual Security and Fire Safety Report which includes statistics from the previous three years concerning crime that occurred on campus, in certain off-campus buildings or on property owned or controlled by the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The report additionally includes statistics for fires which occurred in on-campus student housing, fire safety policies and procedures, institutional policies concerning campus security, and other safety information.Creating and maintaining a safe community is a responsibility that the University of Illinois Police Department and Campus Code Compliance and Fire Safety take very seriously. However, we cannot do it alone. Crime and fire prevention is a community effort, and you are our most valuable public safety resource. By reviewing this report, you are partnering with us to take the necessary steps to look out for yourself and others and to create a safer campus community for everyone.Toward this end, and in compliance with federal regulations and the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Crime Statistics Act, a copy of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Annual Security and Fire Safety Report is available online at go.illinois.edu/asfsr.A hard copy of the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report may be obtained by visiting the U. of I. Public Safety Building at 1110 W. Springfield Ave., Urbana, IL 61801, or by contacting 217-333-1216. You may also review the Daily Crime Log.In addition to reviewing this report, there are other important steps you can take to enhance your own safety on campus:Sign up for Illini-Alert text messages.Review campus safety measures.Take a minute to prepare for emergencies.Review sexual violence and misconduct resources.Review fire safety tips and procedures.We hope that you review these important resources and use the information to promote your own awareness. Together, we can continue to make the campus community a safer place where education, research and public service can flourish.Sincerely,Alice CaryExecutive Director of Public Safety/Chief of PoliceMike BrownCampus Code Compliance and Fire Safety"

                September 22, 2023 2:02 PM
			
        Dear faculty, staff and students, Due to a change in state law, enacted primarily to prevent violence at large events, the Division of Public Safety is now able to use drones to maximize safety at the university. We want you to be aware of this change and to share information about how they will be used on campus. The Illinois’ Freedom from Drone Surveillance Act (725 ILCS 167) allows law enforcement use of drones to a relatively short list of specific purposes: To counter a high risk of terrorist attack.When police have a search warrant signed by a judge.To look for missing people (but not as part of a criminal investigation).In response to a 911 call when the sole purpose is to locate and help victims.For crime scene or traffic crash photography.During special events where notice has been posted at least 24 hours in advance to alert visitors that police drones are in use. In those cases, use is limited to detecting security breaches, evaluating crowd density, identifying and responding to public safety issues and assessing traffic or pedestrian flow. Protests are NOT considered special events under the Act, so it will not be permissible for UIPD or other law enforcement agencies to use drones to monitor them. For our university, football games and many other large events throughout the year likely will be the bulk of the flying. State law expressly prohibits drones from being weaponized in any way. The Division of Public Safety has no plans to deploy drones generally in the campus area. All flights must fall under one of the specific allowable uses outlined in the Act.We intend to use drones as mobile security cameras, to provide visuals that humans on the ground would not otherwise be able to access. We look forward to being able to use this technology as another tool to keep our community safe.For more information, please see our news release. Sincerely,Alice CaryExecutive Director of Public Safety and Chief of Police"

        Dear Colleagues,This week marked the beginning of the 2023 Campus Charitable Fund Drive, our annual workplace giving campaign that runs through November 15.Over the course of the next eight weeks, university employees can easily support the charities of their choice to make a positive impact on the lives of many. I encourage you to explore the CCFD website to learn more about how to give. Giving can be a one-time gift, direct payment or an ongoing payroll deduction.Our contributions to the CCFD each year are a visible and meaningful way for our university to support the communities around us. In 2022, we raised almost $1.4 million. This year, we have set a goal of $1.5 million in funds from our university community to benefit those in need.If you have any questions about CCFD, I encourage you to reach out to your college or department unit leader. These individuals play an invaluable role coordinating campaign efforts and sharing about non-profits in our community and beyond. The continuous success of this campaign would not be possible without the efforts of staff and faculty volunteers who serve as unit leaders.I am grateful for your thoughtful consideration during this campaign. Together, we can make a difference in our communities and across the globe.Sincerely,Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Students and Employees,The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug Free Workplace Act and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act require the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Alcohol and Drug Prevention and Response Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, cannabis (marijuana) is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of cannabis on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to cannabis in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s cannabis prohibition.The university’s cannabis prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical cannabis registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess cannabis on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.The university’s Alcohol and Drug Prevention and Response Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Alcohol and Drug Prevention and Response Program website.Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. University employees should contact Illinois Human Resources at (217) 333-2137.Sincerely,Danita M. Brown YoungVice Chancellor for Student Affairs"

        Dear Campus Community, The hot and humid conditions over the next two days, combined with energy resource operation and availability, have the potential to set new peak usage levels for the fall. Presently, MISO (Midcontinent Independent System Operator) is indicating that there are enough generation resources to maintain grid reliability. Because of the possibility of a peak period, Facilities & Services (F&S) requests the following support measures:All academic and administrative units are strongly encouraged to review, activate, or develop Event Day Action Plans as a part of overall Electrical Grid Response Strategies. Action plans will strengthen protection for essential research, education, and engagement activities during peak periods, especially if any power disruptions were to occur on the regional grid.F&S asks everyone to look for ways to conserve energy in their spaces and protect building systems and equipment against extreme heat. Every individual or departmental action can help make a difference by supporting overall university energy reduction efforts.

        Dear Members of the University Community, At the beginning of each academic year, I write to reaffirm our commitment to build a university community that values diverse ideas, perspectives, and lived experiences, and where each person’s abilities, talents, faith, and culture are respected. Each one of us has a role to play in our university’s efforts to increase access to educational, research, and workplace opportunities by upholding the most fundamental principles of academic freedom, equity, and human dignity. One important way we manifest our commitment to a diverse and inclusive campus is through our affirmative action in employment and nondiscrimination policies. The University prohibits discrimination and harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, disability, national origin, citizenship status, ancestry, age, order of protection status, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, arrest record status, unfavorable discharge from the military, or status as a protected veteran. These protections apply to all members of the campus community. This includes admissions, enrollment, and provision of services, programs, and activities, and all aspects of employment, including but not limited to recruitment, selection, promotion, transfer, merit increases, salary, training and development, and separation. In addition, we take active measures to ensure equal employment opportunity for women, minorities, individuals with disabilities, and veterans as a part of our affirmative action plan, consistent with state and federal laws. These good faith efforts include proactively reaching out to diverse audiences to apply for faculty and staff positions, ensuring that our selection and hiring processes are free of bias and discrimination, and voluntary collection of demographic data from our employees and job applicants. I remain fully committed to our affirmative action plan as a critical way to further equal employment opportunity and ensure that our teaching, research, and service efforts reflect the diversity that exists in our community and beyond.  Please see the Office for Access & Equity website to learn more about OAE’s broader services related to equity, affirmative action and accessibility, and to review our policies and procedures for discrimination, harassment or retaliation. You can submit a discrimination or harassment claim through the university’s online reporting forms. Retaliation against any person for exercising their rights under these policies is strictly prohibited.  The Accessibility and Accommodations Division of the Office for Access & Equity facilitates disability, religious and pregnancy/parenting accommodations for all faculty, staff, undergraduate and graduate student employees, as well as job applicants. To request a reasonable accommodation, employees can complete the online accommodation request form. The Division engages in an interactive process to determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation for each person. The division also provides advice, consultation and educational programming to increase awareness and inclusion of individuals with disabilities.  Students can learn more about academic supports and accommodations services by contacting Disability Resources & Educational Services. Students also have the right to request accommodations for religious observances from instructors and can learn more from the Office of the Dean of Students. We recently shared an update regarding Title IX and our commitment to prevent and respond to sexual misconduct. Please visit the We Care website to learn more about confidential and non-confidential resources, university policies, disciplinary procedures, rights and options and additional information related to the prevention, reporting, and response to sexual misconduct. It is my firm and unwavering commitment to ensure that all people have equal access to the educational and employment opportunities that our university offers. I encourage you to learn more and get involved in our effort to maintain a university community where everyone is able to learn, collaborate, and thrive.  Sincerely,  Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,The University of Illinois believes that each member of our university community should expect to learn and work in a community that prioritizes care, dignity and mutual respect. This expectation includes our responsibility to create a campus community that is free of harassment and discrimination based on sex, including gender discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and sexual violence. University policy prohibits discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation and gender identity, consistent with the Department of Education’s interpretation of discrimination based on sex.As we begin a new academic year, I write to share with you information about the offices, policies and resources available on our campus to help prevent and respond to sexual harassment and misconduct, as well as discuss rights and support.Danielle Fleenor, our university’s Title IX Coordinator, provides oversight and support for the university’s comprehensive Title IX programs and initiatives under the Sexual Misconduct Policy. In addition, the Title IX Office staff also meets with students to discuss rights, resources, and assist with adjustments or accommodations based on pregnancy, childbirth, or related conditions. Dr. Fleenor can be reached at titleixcoordinator@illinois.edu or (844) 616-7978. You may also visit the Title IX Office for more information about ways the office can assist.A full description of the Sexual Misconduct policy, process and information about reporting obligations, as well as the provision of confidential advisors under Title IX, is maintained centrally on the We Care: Sexual Misconduct Support, Response, and Prevention website. All students, faculty and staff are asked to review the University of Illinois System Statement on Sex Discrimination, Sexual Harassment and Other Sexual Misconduct, which is also located on the We Care site. The Sexual Misconduct Policy in the Campus Administrative Manual and Student Code includes other prohibited sexual misconduct in addition to Title IX Sexual Harassment.If you experience sexual misconduct – including sexual harassment, sexual assault, and other forms of sexual violence – know that you are not alone and support is available. On our campus, there are several confidential resources, including the Counseling Center, McKinley Health Center and the Women’s Resources Center (WRC). The WRC has Confidential Advisors, who are staff members specifically trained to provide support and advocacy. The We Care site has additional information about campus resources and answers to frequently asked questions about reporting options.Sexual misconduct in any form violates our institutional values. It is the responsibility of each one of us to stand up against harmful behavior in our community. I encourage you to take a few moments to learn more about these campus resources, so that together we can continue to create a university that supports and values the success and well-being of all.Sincerely,Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Students,The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is committed to maintaining an inclusive educational environment for students of all religious backgrounds, and to upholding state and federal law requiring the university to reasonably accommodate its students’ religious beliefs, observances, and practices concerning admissions, class attendance, and the scheduling of examinations and work requirements.The university recommends that students examine each course syllabus at the beginning of the semester for potential conflicts, notify the instructor, and follow the instructor’s directions as to how to request accommodations. When requested, instructors need to provide reasonable accommodations for religious beliefs, observances, and practices for students as outlined in the Student Code, Article 1, Part 5 – Class Attendance and Article 1, Section 1-107 on Religious Beliefs, Observances, and Practices. For additional information on religious, spiritual and secular inclusion at the university, visit the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion, which maintains a calendar of religious observances. Members of the University of Illinois community practice a range of faith traditions, and it is the expectation of the university that reasonable religious accommodations be considered by instructors regardless of whether the date is included on the Religious Observances that Affect the Academic Calendar webpage. Student Code Section 1-107 b. allows any student to appeal in writing an instructor's decision on a request for accommodation based on religious beliefs, observances, and practices to the dean of the academic unit offering the course. We encourage students of all religious faiths to review this information, share with your peers, and make use of the available resources.

        Dear Colleagues,This year, there have been security incidents that stemmed from emails being sent to the incorrect recipients. We thought this would be a good opportunity to share a few quick and easy tips to ensure emails are getting to the correct people.To ensure that our students have the best experiences while attending the University of Illinois, we must work together to prevent the disclosure of sensitive information about them. Please take a moment to learn some simple tips and best practices when sending email:Check to be sure the recipient address is correct. One of the more common privacy incidents related to email happens because of simple mistakes such as selecting the incorrect auto populated email address or the incorrect (but similar) email address. A quick review of your recipient list can eliminate accidental transmission to the incorrect person.Minimize personal information sent via email.Consider whether you need to send the message or sensitive content at all. In some cases, you may not need to include any or all the information about the individual, or the recipient may have other appropriate means to review the information outside of email.Use generalized subject lines that leave out student names and sensitive details.Use secure storage and systems instead of email messages and attachments.Communicate non-sensitive information via email or Microsoft Teams and indicate to the other party to check an established secure system or storage location to exchange important information rather than including in the email itself. They have greater control and security, access can be removed, and additional access conditions can be set to allow for exchange of sensitive and high-risk information. Establish and use U of I Box folders, High Risk/HIPAA U of I Box folders, and Microsoft Teams folders limited to authorized persons only. This will also help you avoid using email as an unintended file repository. Use other mechanisms for student records and FERPA-related information.  When handling student records such as grades, use only University-authorized student information system(s) such as Banner or MyUI.Together, we can take these simple steps to protect our students while continuing the University’s important work.Questions about the use of email for student information?

        Dear Campus Community,The extreme heat forecasted for this week across the country will substantially increase demand on the regional electric grid and require significant energy optimization strategies. The Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) issued a Maximum Generation Capacity Advisory this morning for its market areas; it continues until further notice because of expected high temperatures and load forecast uncertainty.Energy conservation efforts should be applied and maximized between 1 p.m. and 8 p.m., when consumption is typically the highest, throughout this week on campus. It is anticipated that the load will peak this Thursday afternoon as temperatures are projected to increase up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Please be especially mindful on Thursday to do everything that you can to conserve energy on campus.What energy conservation actions should be prioritized?Facilities & Services (F&S) requests that all students, faculty, and staff help take the steps listed below to conserve energy to the greatest extent possible this week. Your efforts at the departmental, college, institute, and unit levels can significantly reduce campus demand during these peak energy periods. If practical, please shut off, shut down, put into sleep mode, or unplug the following:LightsComputersMonitorsPrintersChargersAppliancesOther nonessential equipmentClose the following items to protect facility equipment and systems:    Outside windows and doors in air-conditioned areasFume hood sashes when not in useAlso, please remember to shut off, shut down, put into sleep mode, or unplug equipment before leaving campus rooms and spaces for the day or long durations.  Why are extensive energy conservation procedures needed right now?MISO helps deliver power across the United States and Canada, including Illinois. Their current advisory instructs market participants to be ready to implement load-modifying resources. Should emergency conditions arise on the regional grid, F&S will utilize operational strategies and business continuity plans developed to meet the university’s energy needs for all essential services to the campus.How can I notify someone about hot/cold concerns in university facilities? While in university facilities, report any temperature-related issues regarding specific rooms or building spaces to the F&S Energy Management Control Center at fandsenergycomm@illinois.edu, 217-244-3783.

Whenever possible, it is best practice to plan exams, required labs, and other due dates around religious holidays. The Religious Observances that Affect the Academic Calendar webpage is an excellent resource to bookmark for reference to find listings of the primary sacred times for many world religions that may affect your course and event planning.When planning around such dates is impossible, instructors need to provide reasonable accommodations for students who have a religious observance as outlined in the Student Code, Article 1, Part 5 – Class Attendance and Article 1, Section 1-107 on Religious Beliefs, Observances, and Practices. Notable for unit executive officers, Section 1-107 b. allows appeals to the dean of the academic unit offering the course when a religious accommodation is not granted or a student believes that the accommodation is unreasonable. Accordingly, units should have a process for the dean to hear such appeals or designate a committee, such as the executive committee or other body, that will hear the appeals and make a recommendation to the dean. If the dean would like legal consultation, the Office of University Counsel is available to help advise. Appeals should be rare, as instructors are expected to offer reasonable accommodations as required under Illinois law.Information for Faculty on Accommodating Religious Observances contains helpful tips for application and best practices. Instructors who have questions may contact Stephen Bryan, Associate Vice Chancellor for Advocacy and Dean of Students, at 217-333-0050 or via email at deanofstudents@illinois.edu.Thank you for your time and consideration of this important matter.Sincerely,Sean C.

        Dear Colleagues,I am pleased to share that Jamelle Sharpe has been selected to serve as the next dean of the College of Law pending approval by the Board of Trustees. His title until officially approved will be dean of the College of Law designate and Guy Raymond Jones Faculty Scholar, and his appointment will begin August 16.It is a privilege to be able to make this announcement during my first weeks as Provost. Though I was not directly involved, I understand that after a highly competitive national search, Professor Sharpe emerged as the clear choice to lead the College of Law. I have reviewed Professor Sharpe’s qualifications and believe the search committee and Provost leadership have selected a highly regarded and well-respected scholar and leader with a strong understanding of the College of Law. Professor Sharpe has demonstrated experience as a collaborative leader and has proven he can systematically and programmatically execute a vision.A professor at the College of Law since 2008, Sharpe brings more than a decade of administrative leadership to the role, having held numerous academic leadership positions at the College of Law, on the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus, and in the broader legal academy. He served as the College of Law’s Associate Dean and Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs. He has served as a Provost Fellow, and as a fellow in the CIC Academic Leadership Program. In addition, he chaired the Association of American Law Schools Conflicts of Law Section, was Chair-elect of the Association of American Law Schools Administrative Law Section and served as President of the University of Illinois’ Phi Beta Kappa chapter. In 2018, the provost selected Professor Sharpe to chair the Urbana-Champaign campus’ Consensual Relationship Policy Review Task Force.A nationally recognized expert on federal administrative law and the federal judiciary, Professor Sharpe’s research focuses on the constitutional and statutory divisions of policymaking authority between courts and administrative agencies. His work has been published in numerous journals including the Administrative Law Review, the William and Mary Law Review, the George Mason Law Review, and the Cardozo Law Review. His 2018 article, “Delegation and Its Discontents,” was awarded the Carroll P. Hurd Award for Excellence in Faculty Scholarship. The first edition of Professor Sharpe’s casebook, “Administrative Law: A Lifecycle Approach,” was awarded the Wayne R. LaFave for Excellence in Faculty Scholarship in 2022. He has provided analysis and commentary for media outlets on a variety of issues, including judicial politics, separation of powers, and immigration law.As a teacher, Professor Sharpe has been selected for the University of Illinois List of Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their Students 20 times. In addition, the College of Law’s students selected him to be a commencement Faculty Hooder in 2015, 2021, and 2023.Before joining the College of Law faculty, Professor Sharpe served as a Bigelow Teaching Fellow and Lecturer in Law at the University of Chicago Law School. Prior to that, he clerked for the Honorable Gerald Bard Tjoflat of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, and was a litigation associate at Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP in New York.Professor Sharpe received his J.D. from Yale Law School, where he was managing editor of the Yale Journal of International Law. He graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from New York University, where he earned a B.A. in English and American Literature. Prior to attending Yale Law School, Professor Sharpe was an analyst in the Investment Banking Division of Morgan Stanley in New York.I want to take this opportunity to thank Venetria Patton, dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, for chairing the search committee and to thank all the members of the committee for their thoughtful and measured work throughout the process.  Please join me in welcoming Professor Sharpe into his new role at Illinois.Sincerely,John ColemanVice Chancellor of Academic Affairs and Provost"

        Dear Campus Community,The extreme heat forecasted for this week will substantially increase demand on the regional electric grid and require significant energy optimization strategies on campus. Facilities & Services (F&S) requests that all students, faculty, and staff help take action to conserve energy to the greatest extent possible through Friday. Energy conservation efforts on campus should be maximized between 1 p.m. and 8 p.m., when consumption is typically the highest. If practical, please shut off, shut down, put into sleep mode, or unplug the following:LightsComputersMonitorsPrintersChargersAppliancesOther nonessential equipmentClose the following items to protect facility equipment and systems:    Outside windows and doors in air-conditioned areasFume hood sashes when not in useWhy are extensive energy conservation efforts needed at this time?The Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) declared Conservation Operations for its central region through July 28 because of expected high temperatures and load forecast uncertainty. MISO also issued a Maximum Generation Capacity Advisory and instructed market participants to be ready to implement load-modifying resources. Should emergency conditions arise on the regional grid, F&S will utilize operational strategies and business continuity plans developed to meet the university’s energy needs for all essential services to the campus.How can I notify someone about hot/cold concerns in university facilities?Another way you can make a difference is by immediately reporting any temperature-related issues regarding specific rooms or building spaces to the F&S Energy Management Control Center at fandsenergycomm@illinois.edu, 217-244-3783. Also, please continue coordinating with unit facility managers and building contacts as typical throughout the notification and review process.Thanks for always doing all you can to conserve energy across the Urbana campus, particularly at this critical time. Your continued support and collaboration are much appreciated and valued.Sincerely,Ehab Kamarah, Ph.D., P.Eng.Associate Vice Chancellor and Executive Director, Facilities & Services"

        Dear colleagues, We have received information that the personal data of many of our students was accessed in a global cyberattack. As reported by the news media, various institutions were targeted in a May 31 ransomware attack, including well-known information technology and accounting firms. University of Illinois System computers were not compromised in this event.  However, the University of Illinois System was notified this week by the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) that personal data of students may have been obtained by an unauthorized party by exploiting a vulnerability in a software product that assists in transferring data files. Once that vulnerability was identified, NSC and other users quickly closed down the access by applying additional security measures at the software provider’s direction.While there is no indication at this time that any compromised information has been used fraudulently, NSC is continuing to investigate and will send a notice directly to the individuals whose data was accessed. We will advocate for that notification to take place as soon as possible.  Prior to receiving any notification, you can take steps to protect your identity. Please refer to the FAQs below.The system will continue to monitor this matter and provide additional updates to those affected.We understand that these types of situations may be stressful for the individuals involved. We will continue to monitor the developing events, to work with other institutions and to follow up with additional communications as soon as possible.It is our intention to let you know as much as we know, without creating unnecessary concern.

JonesExecutive Vice President and Vice President of Academic AffairsUniversity of Illinois SystemJoe BarnesChief Digital Risk OfficerUniversity of Illinois SystemFAQs: What is NSC and why do we transfer student data to them?We are required to provide data to the National Student Clearinghouse, which was founded in 1993 by the higher education community to carry out the functions of student data reporting and exchange. A nonprofit and nongovernmental organization, NSC is the leading provider of educational reporting, data exchange, verification and research services.What types of data were involved?NSC reports that “(t)he unauthorized party obtained certain files within the Clearinghouse’s MOVEit environment, which may have included information from the student record database on current or former students. We have no evidence that the affected files included the enrollment and degree files that organizations submit to the Clearinghouse for reporting requirements and for verifications.What can I do to protect my identity?The University of Illinois System provides resources and strategies to help manage the risk of identity theft.

        Dear colleagues:It’s our pleasure to share the news with you that a 4% merit-based salary program across the University of Illinois System will take effect Aug. 16 for faculty members and academic professionals, and Aug. 20 for civil service staff. This represents an increase from last year and continues to be an important priority in our budgeting process. Consultation with our leadership, including university chancellors and vice presidents, shaped this year’s program levels as part of the overall budget for the upcoming fiscal year. The percentage increase represents an average increase for each unit. As a merit-based program, it is expected that there will be a range of salary increases within a unit. On the basis of performance, some employees will receive increases more than the average, and others may receive a smaller percentage.Each of our three universities has also been asked to apply their own guidelines for separate programs to address compression, market, equity and retention issues. Commitments for existing contractual agreements, promotions and equity adjustments will also be honored as part of this program.Pay adjustments for faculty and staff in bargaining units will be determined by negotiations with the bargaining representative and/or applicable contract settlements and are not subject to unilateral adjustments unless authorized or permitted pursuant to the collective bargaining process.The three universities will follow up with additional information on the salary program in the coming weeks.Thank you for the many ways that you contribute to the quality, well-earned reputation, and ever-growing impact of our world-class universities. As always, we remain deeply grateful for your hard work, dedication and loyalty. Sincerely,Tim"

All future Illini-Alert messages will include one of these keywords: Urgent, Critical, Emergency, Test or Drill. These keywords signify to wireless carriers that the alert is a legitimate emergency message. The inclusion of a keyword increases the likelihood that the message will successfully pass through the carriers' spam filters and be delivered to your device. The keywords are not intended to characterize the seriousness of an emergency or the urgency of your response.All campus community members are encouraged to sign up for Illini-Alert text messages to receive prompt notification of campus emergencies. You can do so by visiting http://emergency.illinois.edu. Contact information for friends and relatives may be added at http://go.illinois.edu/illinialertmyfamily.

Projects chosen for the program’s fifth round of funding demonstrate the spirit of collaboration, innovation and immense promise to impact our campus community and beyond.  Since the Investment for Growth program was created in 2018, our university has invested more than $91 million to provide seed funding for projects that generate revenue; advance our teaching, research and outreach missions; and address areas of high and emerging student demand. Examples of previously funded projects include: Supporting and Promoting the Practical Value of a Humanities Education in the 21st Century; Jump Start Data Science Education at Illinois; Supporting Growth of Master of Engineering (MEng) Programs and Professional Education; and South Campus Center for Interdisciplinary Learning (Feasibility/Architectural).  Through the Investment for Growth program, our hope is to encourage colleges to be bold in their thinking and to dream big. If you have an idea for the next round of Investment for Growth proposals, we encourage you to talk to your department head and dean. The FY24 Funded projects are:National Leadership in Data Science Education Supporting a Significant Visible Social ImpactGrainger College of Engineering, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences LAS Student Success CenterCollege of Liberal Arts and Sciences Virtual Care Hub in the College of Veterinary MedicineCollege of Veterinary MedicineHealthcare Innovation, Design and Entrepreneurship – Graduate Certificate and Related OpportunitiesCarle Illinois College of Medicine, Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation, Gies College of Business, Grainger College of EngineeringExpanding Online Graduate Education in the College of Applied Health SciencesCollege of Applied Health Sciences Proposal for the Creation of a New Online Master’s Degree Concentration in Trauma-Informed EducationCollege of EducationPlayful by Design: Expanding the Transformative Potentials of Games@IllinoisSchool of Information Sciences, College of Education, College of Fine and Applied Arts, Grainger College of Engineering, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, College of MediaProgram Innovation for an Evolving ProfessionSchool of Labor and Employment Relations Illinois Center for Family & Community-Engaged STEAMGrainger College of Engineering, Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Carle Illinois College of Medicine, College of EducationCenter for Advanced Climate Solutions (CACS), Enhancing Capacity and Accelerating Impacts in Climate Research, Education, and Engagement Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation, School of Labor and Employment Relations, Grainger College of Engineering, College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences SE@UIUC: A Green Education for Sustainable Futures and Environmental JusticeCollege of EducationView descriptions of this year’s funded projects here.

        Dear Students and Employees,The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug Free Workplace Act and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act require the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Alcohol and Drug Prevention and Response Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, cannabis (marijuana) is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of cannabis on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to cannabis in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s cannabis prohibition.The university’s cannabis prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical cannabis registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess cannabis on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.The university’s Alcohol and Drug Prevention and Response Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees.

        Dear Faculty & Staff,  As we move into the end of the academic year, we are also moving into the next phases of our Operational Excellence @ Illinois initiative. This program, consisting of university-wide teams of staff, is working to reimagine our operations in ways that eliminate administrative barriers and better support our teaching, research and other university missions.   HR and IT emerged as the first critical university priorities in Operational Excellence and have been the primary focus of the teams in the past year. Thanks to the collaborative efforts and commitment of all involved, both areas are moving into the Implementation Phase, the final phase of the initiative. In addition to progress made within HR and IT, Marketing & Communications (Marcom) has advanced to the Detailed Design Phase. We want to thank the leadership and staff across these functions for their willingness to create a more resilient and efficient university.    Initiative updates:  The HR Functional Design Team completed a foundational service catalog and an organizational analysis to optimize both the experience of those receiving HR services and the satisfaction and career growth opportunities of HR employees. Upcoming HR efforts will focus on institution-wide organizational improvement of both Illinois Human Resources and unit-level HR services and operations. Illinois Human Resources has reorganized to better support campus services and is executing a change management strategy titled “IHR Reimagine.” The IT Functional Design Team also developed an early service catalog, and IT leadership identified key priorities for 2023 aimed at developing foundational service delivery structures. Implementation efforts will focus on establishing broader IT service management practices and processes through the creation of the IT Enterprise Service Management Office and developing a Center of Web Expertise to support campuswide web development and management services.   Within the Marcom function, Public Affairs rebranded to the Office of Strategic Communications and Marketing, reorganized its functions into Centers of Expertise and created infrastructure to support institution- and unit-level strategic planning. With this foundation in place, Marcom has now advanced to the Detailed Design Phase, which involves identifying key services and considering the best ways to deliver them. Marcom will also collaborate with IT on developing campuswide, web-related infrastructure. Additional university functions, including Budget, Data, Procurement and Space, began efforts to implement improvements identified in the earliest phases of Operational Excellence. Operational Excellence leaders will work with college, school and centrally budgeted unit leaders over the summer/early fall to establish unit-level transition teams to support the implementation of service delivery changes in alignment with the needs of unit constituents. To start, transition teams will support HR-related changes and changes in other functions, helping constituents understand upcoming updates and the impact of these updates to their work.  Ensuring long-term, continued success within these administrative areas remains a focus of this work. The Strategic Project Management Office launched standing advisory committees for each function involved in Operational Excellence (HR, IT, Budget, Space, Procurement, Marcom and Data) to promote campuswide coordination and alignment on future administrative initiatives. The office also continues to oversee all Operational Excellence projects. Further, over the last several months, we have made various investments in central services to support Operational Excellence and institutional change more broadly, such as filling project management and service management positions. Please visit the Operational Excellence website and its FAQ page to learn more about the individual projects, progress and accomplishments within each administrative area. And if you have questions, please email them to operationalexcellence@illinois.edu.   Thank you for your continued collaboration and support as we work to rethink “business as usual” across our university. Sincerely,  Mike DeLorenzo  Vice Chancellor for Administration and Operations   Vicky Gress  Associate Chancellor and Vice Provost for Budget and Resource Planning "

        Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,It is with great sorrow that I write to tell you that University of Illinois Alumni Association President Jen Dillavou passed away this weekend following a tenacious fight with cancer. She was at home, surrounded by family and friends. Our thoughts are with her husband, Tom, and her two sons, Jake and Max, in these sad days.Jen joined the UIAA as its president in 2017, but her connections to this university – and to this entire community – began long before. She grew up right here in Champaign and earned her undergraduate degree from our College of Education in 1982. And she began a career in higher education with our own University of Illinois Foundation. While Jen’s career led her on a journey that included leadership roles at Indiana University, Georgia State, Carnegie Mellon and Ohio University, anyone who knew Jen will tell you it was only a matter of time until her heart was going to bring her home to Illinois.As the first woman to serve as the permanent president of the UIAA, Jen was breaking new ground from the moment she returned. For the six years we worked together, Jen was a tireless advocate for our university’s missions. And I can tell you that I have met no individual who took a greater joy in watching the new class of graduates who joined our global alumni family each May than her.I write this message to honor Jen’s professional service and achievement as a member of our university leadership team and as the president of one of the largest alumni associations in country. But to those who worked with her as a colleague or for the alumni who met her at events or for members of the local community who watched her grow up, I think what defined Jen was the enthusiastic joy she took in everything she did – small or grand.In fact, as I write this, it is impossible for me to hold any picture of Jen in my mind other than one of her on Commencement morning, dressed in full regalia, wearing a huge, infectious smile on her face as we walk together down the 50-yard line of Memorial Stadium surrounded by a sea of orange and blue graduates and their families. This year, that procession will be a little slower and our joy will be tempered by her absence.I invite you to join us for a campus celebration of life in Jen’s honor this Thursday, May 4, at 5:30 p.m. in Foellinger Great Hall at the Krannert Center.Please join me in offering Tom, Max and Jake our condolences as a university family today.Sincerely,Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear colleagues: We are pleased to announce that additional paid days off again will be provided during the December/January holidays, a small token that we hope conveys just how much we appreciate everything you do to uphold the standards of excellence across the University of Illinois System. Employees who are eligible for leave benefits will receive three paid gift days for this year’s Reduced Service Days on Dec. 22, 28 and 29. Combined with holidays, other paid time off and weekends, it will extend the year-end break from Friday, Dec. 22, through Monday, Jan. 1. Before the program began in 2016, employees had been required to draw from their annual pool of paid time off to be paid for the three Reduced Service Days. Our universities, hospital and clinics, and system offices will follow up with more details, including how to report the gift days and how they can be used on different days by essential employees who must work on those three dates. For employees in union-represented bargaining units, paid time off for the holidays is addressed through the collective bargaining process. The additional paid time off is part of our ongoing recognition of how much we appreciate your hard work, resiliency, and commitment. You make possible the life-changing education and high-impact research we provide.Thank you for continuing to build upon a legacy that extends back more than 150 years. We hope you enjoy a spectacular year leading up to a holiday season of renewed joy and time to relax and reflect with family and friends.  Sincerely, Tim Killeen, President, U of I System Nick Jones, Executive Vice President and Vice President for Academic Affairs, U of I System Robert J.

                April 26, 2023 10:01 AM
			
        Dear Colleagues,Last June, I charged a Health Innovation Visioning Committee to assess the university’s health-related assets across our colleges and institutes and propose the future role of Illinois as a pioneer in establishing a new technology-driven academic health research and education model that makes a significant, visible and sustained impact on human health. I asked the committee to think comprehensively, broadly and boldly about how such a model can uniquely position Illinois as a national and global leader in health innovation that improves the human condition and impacts humanity.Over several months, the committee consulted with a large list of campus stakeholders and received broad feedback from the campus community through three Town Hall meetings and an online feedback form. After thoroughly reviewing, analyzing and discussing various ideas and input, the committee submitted a final report to me in January.I am pleased to share the vision and plan emerging from their work. I believe this plan positions Illinois as an epicenter for health innovation while complementing and supporting our existing investments and strategic goals for the many key units on campus related to health. Foundational to this vision is a mission-driven research and education model. These missions, or grand health challenges, include issues related to healthcare access and equity, nutrition, mental health, aging, global health, environmental health and more. The newly envisioned model will support a new approach to solving these challenges, leveraging technology-inspired health innovation, uniting students, faculty, staff and partners across disciplines and strengthening relationships with our local and global partners and communities.   The committee recommended that the physical embodiment of this new health innovation model will be an Institute for Health Innovation (IHI) – an evolution and visioning growth of the previously proposed Translational Research Facility. The Institute for Health Innovation will serve as a connector and physical hub for driving missions across education, research, community engagement, partnerships and entrepreneurial translation.I encourage you to visit healthinnovation.illinois.edu for a summary of the committee report, as well as access to the full report. To carry this vision forward, a Health Innovation Implementation Committee will be appointed and charged, and collectively this work will be integrated into Boldly Illinois: Strategic Plan 2030. I’d like to offer my sincere thanks to Professor Stephen Boppart, who served as chair of the visioning committee and will continue to lead the implementation efforts for the future of health innovation at Illinois and oversee IHSI and its next steps. I would also like to thank Kraig Wagenecht, who served as the committee’s project manager, the members and support staff for the visioning committee and all those who offered their ideas and input to inform this new model.This effort has and will continue to require the expertise and commitment of our entire campus community. I look forward to further outcomes in this process to bring about transformative change and impact on human health, and for the state, nation and world.  Sincerely,Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Faculty, Students and Staff,It is my great pleasure to announce that John Coleman, dean of the College of Liberal Arts (CLA) at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, will serve as our next vice chancellor for academic affairs and provost. Dean Coleman’s appointment in this new role will begin on July 19. His appointment is pending approval by the Board of Trustees, and he will hold the title of “designate” until that time.  Dean Coleman has established an international reputation as an educator, a scholar and as an academic leader. Having served nearly his entire academic career in Big Ten, public, land-grant research universities, he comes to Illinois with a deep and profound understanding of our foundational obligations to translate knowledge, education and exploration into better lives for those we serve. He has been in his current role as dean at Minnesota since 2014. He began his academic career at the University of Texas and went on to spend more than two decades at the University of Wisconsin as a faculty member and department chair in the department of political science. At Wisconsin, Dean Coleman held the Glenn B. and Cleone Orr Hawkins Professorship, was a Jeffrey and Susanne Lyons Family Faculty Fellow and was a recipient of the Chancellor’s Distinguished Teaching Award. He has also served as president of the political organizations and political parties section of the American Political Science Association. He holds his Ph.D. in political science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.His experience leading the CLA at Minnesota has demonstrated Dean Coleman’s skill and expertise in fostering excellence in a deeply complex academic enterprise like our own. The college consists of nearly 50 departments, programs and research centers that cross disciplinary boundaries and span the budgetary, pedagogical and scholarly spectrum. His tenure in the college has been marked by significant increases in enrollment of students from underrepresented backgrounds that were matched along the way with record levels of graduation and retention rates. He championed investments in new initiatives to promote and reward research innovation and creative excellence among his faculty and supported and encouraged the development of new cross-college degree programs. And he led comprehensive efforts to strategically deepen and expand the college’s engagement with its alumni, donors, the surrounding community and the state. As the current chair of the Big Ten Liberal Arts and Sciences Deans, he comes to Illinois as a recognized academic leader among our peer institutions. I want to thank the search committee, chaired by Gies College of Business Dean Jeff Brown, for its thorough and careful work in recruiting and evaluating an impressive pool of candidates for this critically important leadership position here at Illinois.  I want to express my deep appreciation to Bill Bernhard for his leadership as interim vice chancellor for academic affairs and provost. His collaborative and consultative approach has brought stability with continued forward movement in our academic operations as we searched for a permanent provost. He has been a patient, thoughtful and progressive leader throughout this transition, and he has agreed to continue in this role through July.From the day we launched our search I described this as one of the most desirable academic leadership positions in all of American higher education. I charged our committee and our entire campus to take the necessary time and invest the extensive effort to find the best candidate to lead our academic missions forward with the vision and urgency our state expects from its flagship university. It is very clear to me that our university community took that charge to heart in bringing Dean Coleman to Illinois as our next provost.In his public presentation here in February, Dean Coleman made a simple statement about the broad vision he would bring to Illinois as our provost, and it was a defining moment in the search. He told us he believed Illinois should not only be the best university in the world, but we should be the best university for the world. This kind of bold thinking – setting the very highest expectations for us when our society’s needs have never been greater – resonated with so many of us because it is so true to the spirit of innovation and service that has defined our university for 155 years.Please join me in congratulating John Coleman and welcoming him to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.Sincerely,Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,Earlier this week, we learned of a series of hateful, racist messages in response to an openly available, widely publicized survey that was posted by a group of our students. These responses, some of which have since been shared on various social media channels, contain detestable language and reports of threatening actions against all members of our Black community. Seeing such vitriolic expressions using language that is rooted solely in hatred, bigotry and intolerance is unsettling to all of us.We have heard from many who saw some of these messages posted online and are understandably upset by the content. We have not received any reports from anyone in our campus community who received a direct threat of violence that was indicated in the survey, but if you receive such threats, you should call 911. If you view additional hateful, racist messages online, we encourage you to share these incidents with Campus Belonging at go.illinois.edu/CampusBelonging. Additionally, counseling and other resources of support are available at wellness.illinois.edu.We strive to foster a community where everyone has the opportunity to learn and thrive in a welcoming and safe environment. We condemn these messages that are yet another divisive affront to our mutual values of respect and tolerance. We value and celebrate all members of our university community, and we ask that you join us in rejecting and condemning these messages.Sincerely,Robert J. JonesChancellorSean GarrickVice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and InclusionDanita M. Brown YoungVice Chancellor for Student Affairs"

All future Illini-Alert messages will include one of these keywords: Urgent, Critical, Emergency, Test or Drill. These keywords signify to wireless carriers that the alert is a legitimate emergency message. The inclusion of a keyword increases the likelihood that the message will successfully pass through the carriers' spam filters and be delivered to your device. The keywords are not intended to characterize the seriousness of an emergency or the urgency of your response.All campus community members are encouraged to sign up for Illini-Alert text messages to receive prompt notification of campus emergencies. You can do so by visiting http://emergency.illinois.edu. Contact information for friends and relatives may be added at http://go.illinois.edu/illinialertmyfamily. Anyone else can sign up by texting ""IlliniAlert"" to 226787.The March 7 test of the Illini-Alert system will use all of the communication capabilities of the emergency notification system:Email messages will be sent to all active faculty and staff members and students with campus email addresses.Text messages will be sent to those people who have registered their cellphone numbers.  A message will be sent to the Illini-Alert Twitter account (http://twitter.com/illinialert).A message will appear on all digital signs connected to the Illini-Alert system.The test does not require any response; evaluators will be able to monitor the speed and distribution rates of the messaging.

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,This semester has already seen devastation, pain and loss—mass violence, police brutality, continuing wars and sudden, catastrophic natural disasters—that have affected each one of us directly or indirectly. There have also been the personal losses that members of our community have endured and acts of dehumanization and disregard, small and large, that we may encounter during the course of a day or a week. We continue to see hateful and threatening messages on social media, as recently as last night, directed at members of our community and even posing as members of our community. We must respond to such attempts to perpetuate hate and violence by standing together against anti-Semitism, anti-Zionism, Islamophobia, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia and other forms of intolerance.It is important for us to take a moment to remember the full and brilliant complement of people who comprise the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. We are here together to question deeply and learn fearlessly, striving to improve lives, address harms and heal damage and pain with our research, innovations and creative pursuits. We derive strength from our diversity of experiences and perspectives, and we celebrate people of all backgrounds and identities, and share in the belief of the importance to ensure the safety, wellbeing and success of each member of our campus community.Though it may not be possible to acknowledge all the loss that may affect members of our campus community when it occurs, we work to reach out to those who might be most affected and provide needed support. You are not alone and have resources available to you—for students through the Counseling Center, McKinley Health Services, the Student Assistance Center or International Student and Scholar Services. Faculty and staff can reach out to Faculty/Staff Assistance Services. Information about additional campus and community resources is available at wellness.illinois.edu.I wish you all a productive and fulfilling semester.Sincerely,Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,It is my pleasure to announce that Claire Stewart has been selected as the next Juanita J. and Robert E. Simpson Dean of Libraries and University Librarian Designate beginning May 16, pending approval by the Board of Trustees. Professor Christopher Prom will continue to serve as interim dean until that time.Professor Stewart currently serves as the Dean of Libraries for the University of Nebraska- Lincoln and chairs the University of Nebraska Consortium of Libraries Executive Committee. Her tenure at Nebraska was marked by a number of important milestones for the library. Under her leadership, Nebraska completed a major renovation of the library’s second largest facility. She rejuvenated the library’s philanthropic support program by reengaging existing donors and building new connections for future private support. She initiated a university-wide effort to develop a comprehensive research data strategy. And she developed new collaborative relationships with colleges and units that resulted in major new research partnerships in disciplines that ranged from agriculture to the digital humanities.  Professor Stewart has a deep record of service to national associations, recently completing a term as chair of the Advocacy and Public Policy Committee for the Association of Research Libraries. She currently serves as chair of the Board of Governors for HathiTrust and is a member of the steering committees for the Big Ten Academic Alliance’s BIG Collection and Geospatial Data projects. She is also a member of the American Council of Learned Societies’ Commission on Fostering and Sustaining Diverse Digital Scholarship.From previous positions at the University of Minnesota and Northwestern University, Professor Stewart brings a deep, working knowledge of the scholarly, educational and engagement missions that define Big Ten research universities. Professor Stewart’s combination of experience, academic achievement and her demonstrated record as an innovative, thoughtful, and strategic leader made her the clear choice to be the next leader of our University Libraries at Illinois.I want to thank the members of the search committee, chaired by Dean Tracy Sulkin of the College of Media, for their thoughtful and careful work. And I also want to thank Professor Christopher Prom for his service as the interim dean.I hope you will all join me in congratulating Professor Claire Stewart on her selection as the new Juanita J. and Robert E.

Pritzker's budget proposal will be sent to news media later this afternoon.Governor’s 2024 budget plan would provide reinvestment in U of I System and public higher educationSPRINGFIELD – The state budget proposed today by Gov. J.B. Pritzker would provide a 7% increase in general operating support for the University of Illinois System, increasing the system’s total general funds appropriation to $697.1 million for the coming fiscal year, and representing a vital reinvestment in public higher education that would build on last year’s appropriation increases. “We share with the governor a vested interest in our state’s success, and higher education is a critical partner,” University of Illinois System President Tim Killeen said. “We are excited to see the governor’s strong support in today’s budget proposal. It represents a second consecutive year of needed reinvestment in our public colleges and universities. This funding would help enhance the world-class education and experiences of our students, the workforce of the future.”The governor also recommended a $100 million increase for the state’s Monetary Award Program (MAP), to $701 million. About 44 percent of all resident undergraduate students across the U of I System universities receive MAP aid.“Programs like MAP and the state’s AIM High grants are important tools to support our efforts to increase access and affordability, keeping more of our students in the state of Illinois,” Killeen added. “We appreciate the governor’s leadership in making higher education the important priority that it deserves to be. We are eager to work with the governor and General Assembly members from across the state to ensure an exciting future for the state of Illinois.”                                                                                 ###The University of Illinois System is a world leader in research and discovery, and the largest educational institution in the state with more than 94,800 students, about 26,000 full-time equivalent faculty and staff, and universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield.

                February 14, 2023 11:14 AM
			
        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,We are all grieving with our colleagues and friends in East Lansing following last night’s mass shooting at Michigan State University. This is a university with which we have close connections and a community that feels like our own in many ways. No words can adequately express our sadness for the family and friends of those whose lives were taken and for those who were wounded.It is an extremely sad and disheartening truth that in today’s society, universities and communities like ours make plans and practice responses to unthinkable events. We have done this at Illinois, and our administration and first responders conduct exercises to test how we would implement those plans across a variety of possible scenarios. We all hope that we never have to exercise these plans. Last night, MSU’s planning led to the rapid and focused response of university and community first responders. Their efforts prepared and guided the actions of all the students, staff and faculty even in a moment of intense distress and crisis and prevented even more injuries and greater loss of life. The response of the entire Michigan State community to protect one another in the most difficult circumstances most of us can imagine is truly admirable.We all realize that today will bring the first hard steps from this tragedy for all of the MSU family. They are grieving those who lost their lives. They are worrying for those who were injured and still face medical challenges. They are trying to understand how anyone could ever commit such an act of senseless violence. And I think many must be wondering how their community can heal and recover. These are steps they do not have to take alone, and this is a weight all of us can help to shoulder.The students, staff and faculty of Michigan State have long been many things to us here at Illinois. Spirited athletic rivals. Personal friends and professional colleagues. Respected academic partners and vital research collaborators. But today, first-and-foremost, they are members of our family who are in our hearts as they mourn for those killed last night and as they pray for those who were injured.Sincerely,Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Hello from the Student Sustainability Committee (SSC)!Did you know that all UIUC students pay $14 a semester for campus sustainability?Since 2008, we've dedicated $16.19 million towards 334 individual projects that have decreased UIUC’s environmental impact, cultivated a culture of sustainability, and advanced Illinois Climate Action Plan (iCAP) objectives. How did we do it? With the Illinois Green Fund, which is composed of two student-initiated fees ($12.06 per student per semester for the Sustainable Campus Environment Fee and $2 per student per semester for the Cleaner Energy Technologies Fee). We are a group of students made possible by students!SSC uses the Illinois Green Fund to finance student-, staff-, and faculty-led sustainability projects. These projects are reviewed by one of our five Working Groups: Energy, Transportation & Infrastructure, Education & Justice, Food & Waste, and Land, Water, & Air. We’ve funded projects like Eco-Illini, Solar Decathlon, Red Oak Rain Garden, the Illini Union’s recycling bins, CIF’s geothermal system, and many more to come! Thanks to the support of students and the Board of Trustees, a $4 increase to our student fees has been approved—the Illinois Green Fund will increase by nearly 30 percent! This accomplishment will allow SSC to fund even more sustainable projects annually, continue to build engagement and community, and advance iCAP objectives.BOARD MEMBER APPLICATIONS FOR 2023-24 ARE NOW OPEN!As a board member, you will play a key role in the organization by leading or participating in Working Groups, the Communications team, or the Social Initiatives team.

In cases where an employee may not have accrued vacation/personal leave, departments may authorize an approved absence without pay. Employees with questions regarding requesting absence time due to weather conditions should consult with their supervisors. University employees can find more detailed information about inclement weather policies here and a list of some frequently asked questions here. In addition, and if appropriate for one’s position, remote work may be utilized if approved by a supervisor.While we are planning for normal academic operations tomorrow, the morning hours are still likely to be messy. Please plan on extra time to get to work or to class and as always, please exercise caution and care when you are outside.We will monitor the weather throughout the night, and we will be prepared to reevaluate our operational plans if conditions are significantly worse than predicted.

        Dear Colleagues,As we finalize our review of applications for undergraduate admission for the Fall 2023 semester, in cooperation with the Senate Committee on Admissions, we would like to remind you of the university policies regarding admissions confidentiality and third-party inquiries. Admissions officers may discuss a student’s application only with the applicant, the applicant’s parents/legal guardian, spouse or school-appointed counselor. Other individuals, including university employees without admissions responsibilities, are not permitted to inquire about a student’s application with a university admissions officer, and admissions officers are prohibited from sharing information with third parties regarding a student’s application.A university admissions officer is considered anyone with admissions responsibility. This includes not only admissions staff in central admissions units such as the Office of Undergraduate Admissions and the Graduate College, but also faculty and staff within academic college and departmental offices responsible for reviewing and making decision recommendations for applicants. A firewall has been placed around faculty, administrators and admissions staff with admissions responsibility so that those without admissions responsibility may not influence decisions.Unsolicited letters of recommendation or emails of support or appeal are not accepted or considered in our processes. Please review this Summary of University of Illinois Admissions Firewall Practices for a complete list of inquiries that are and are not permitted, as well as examples of scenarios and appropriate responses.At the graduate level, it is important to note that those with admissions responsibility are allowed to accept information from an applicant’s recommenders in the form of formal letters, emails and phone communications; however, they may not discuss the applicant’s admission status with the recommender. If they are contacted about an applicant’s admission status by a recommender, they are to notify the recommender that while they may accept supporting information for the applicant’s file, they may not discuss the applicant’s admission status without expressed written permission from the applicant. Also at the graduate level, the Graduate College discourages any discussions with an applicant’s parent and/or spouse regarding the applicant’s status without the written permission from the applicant.Inappropriate activities or attempts to circumvent these policies should be reported to the Ethics Officer or reported anonymously using the anonymous report feature of the Admissions Inquiry Log.Thank you for helping to protect the integrity of our admissions process.Sincerely,Andrew BorstDirector of Undergraduate AdmissionsOffice of Undergraduate AdmissionsElizabeth SparkAssistant Dean for Admissions, Registration, and Enrollment ServicesGraduate College"

        Dear Students and Employees,The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug Free Workplace Act and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act require the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Alcohol and Drug Prevention and Response Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, cannabis (marijuana) is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of cannabis on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to cannabis in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s cannabis prohibition.The university’s cannabis prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical cannabis registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess cannabis on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.The university’s Alcohol and Drug Prevention and Response Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Alcohol and Drug Prevention and Response Program website.Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. University employees should contact Illinois Human Resources at (217) 333-2137.Sincerely,Dr. Danita M. Brown YoungVice Chancellor for Student Affairs"

                January 5, 2023 5:00 PM
			
        Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,
Effective immediately, we are removing COVID-19 vaccination and testing requirements for University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign students, staff and faculty. This follows the announcement that President Killeen outlined in this massmail. 
Our compliance systems for employees and students have been updated to reflect this change.
Faculty or staff who have questions about these changes should reach out to Labor and Employment Relations in Illinois Human Resources at ihr-ler@illinois.edu.
Undergraduate or graduate students with questions should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 217-333-0050 or at deanofstudents@illinois.edu.
Several options for free testing will continue to be available to our students, faculty and staff.
The SHIELD Illinois community testing site will continue to operate in the Campus Recreation Center East (CRCE) Monday through Friday. This testing is free and open to any member of the community Monday through Friday, between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. This free testing is made possible through a partnership between the Illinois Department of Public Health and SHIELD Illinois that utilizes federal funds.
Our Illini Union testing site will remain in operation through Friday, Feb. 10. We will transition our PCR testing program fully to the SHIELD Illinois community site after that date.
We will also continue to distribute free, rapid test antigen kits to students, faculty and staff at campus locations for the rest of the academic year.
Additional information about community testing options is available from the Illinois Department of Public Health.
If you do test positive for COVID-19, you are still expected to follow the current guidance that includes isolation for five days. Those guidelines can be found here if you need to review them.
I want to reiterate President Killeen’s encouragement to all members of our community to get one of the COVID-19 vaccines and the available boosters even if they are no longer required. They continue to offer protection—for yourself and those around you—against the most serious effects of COVID-19. And as we continue to navigate the flu season, I also encourage you to get your flu vaccination if you haven’t done so already.
I hope all of us continue to make personal decisions and take individual actions that maximize the safety of our community and that we all continue to respect the decisions individuals make for themselves and their families. Getting vaccinated and boosted, wearing a face covering, staying home if you aren’t feeling well – these are simple things we can do to ensure that we can continue to enjoy the in-person activities we lost during the worst months of this pandemic.
Thank you all for your sustained and impressive efforts throughout the most challenging period of our university’s history in living memory.
Sincerely,
Robert J. Jones"

                January 5, 2023 4:39 PM
			
        Dear students, faculty and staff:
As we begin the spring semester, it is important to remain vigilant to protect ourselves against COVID-19. Core to this is the science-based decision-making process we have followed from the very beginning, using guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the Illinois Department of Public Health and relevant campus and community scientific analyses.
Vaccines have been and remain a highly effective tool for preventing serious illness. Although the primary vaccination series is significantly less effective for the new COVID-19 subvariants now prevalent nationwide, the available bivalent booster continues to offer protection against severe disease. As the virus continues to evolve, so too will COVID-19 vaccines. 
Accordingly (with the exception of the UIHealth system and clinics, which have separate regulations), the University of Illinois System will no longer require the COVID-19 primary vaccine series for students and employees. We do, however, strongly recommend that you stay up to date with the most recent vaccine or booster available as a barrier to serious illness.
Testing also continues to be a valuable tool for COVID-19 containment and, while the University of Illinois System will no longer require regular testing of those who are unvaccinated, if you do have symptoms or have been exposed to the virus, we encourage you to take advantage of the free testing that will continue to be available.
If you do feel ill or have symptoms of COVID-19, we also strongly urge you to stay home from school and work to protect your classmates and colleagues.
Masks remain effective in limiting COVID-19 transmission, and we encourage everyone to use them, particularly in indoor spaces. Due to the different circumstances within our three universities, masking requirements may vary and could change as deemed necessary. Please refer to each university’s updated guidance on masking.
In addition, all three universities will be using an additional protective tool this spring pioneered by our Discovery Partners Institute and University of Illinois Chicago researchers. The new Wastewater Surveillance System will expand wastewater testing to provide early warnings about the prevalence of COVID-19 on our campuses.
Thank you all for your continued diligence. Through your efforts, the U of I System has set a high standard for safety during the pandemic and served as a model for the nation. I am confident that with your help we will continue our vigilance against the COVID-19 virus.
With my warm best wishes for the new year ahead,
Tim"

                December 22, 2022 11:02 AM
			
        With a Winter Storm Warning in effect from today through Saturday, Facilities & Services (F&S) staff have already started pretreatment and snow and ice removal preparations to keep the campus open and accessible for students, faculty, and staff throughout this period. 
The National Weather Service is indicating that the major multiday winter weather event will likely produce blizzard conditions and the following significant impacts:
Mixed precipitation combined with strong winds—icing over concrete surfaces such as roads, stairs, parking lots, and sidewalks
Blowing and drifting snow with two to four inches possible—reducing visibility to a quarter mile or less at times and making any travel hazardous
Extreme wind chills of up to 30 below zero—causing frostbite to exposed skin in under an hour
Wind gusts as high as 50 miles per hour—capable of bringing down tree branches and moving unsecured objects
The intensity and variability of this winter storm also have the potential to reduce the effectiveness of initial pretreatment and clearing activities. The probability of icing, followed by several inches of snow, will make for a challenging and lengthy removal process and create extremely slippery conditions for several days. The university strongly recommends adjusting plans and postponing voluntary trips once the storm begins. If you must travel on campus when subfreezing temperatures and layers of ice and snow exist, please use tremendous caution and prepare for contingencies. 
More information about F&S snow and ice removal procedures is available at http://www.fs.illinois.edu/services/maintenance/snow-removal, including a list of priority parking lot locations that will be continuously cleared throughout the event and support MTD service and bus stop access.
Thanks for your assistance as F&S crews perform this priority work and do their best to keep campus sidewalks, streets, pathways, parking lots, and building entrances clear of snow and ice.
Sincerely,
Dr. Ehab KamarahAssociate Vice Chancellor and Executive Director, Facilities & Services"

        Dear students, faculty and staff,
As the semester ends and we make plans to travel, gather with family and friends and celebrate the holidays, we ask you to remain vigilant to protect yourself and others against COVID-19.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is still prevalent and our own wastewater testing and reports from state and local health departments and hospitals all tell us that cases are increasing in many areas. The number of flu cases across the country is high, as well, greatly exacerbating the problem. We need to continue to guard against the spread of these viruses during the holiday season.
Throughout the pandemic, you have distinguished yourselves through your willingness to take common-sense steps to protect yourselves and each other. Your vigilance helped us to safely return to our campuses in the first year of the pandemic and has since allowed us to operate while protecting your health and that of the communities around our universities.
In the weeks ahead, we ask you to continue to take responsible steps such as wearing a face covering in crowded spaces, getting all available COVID-19 and flu vaccinations, and, if you do have symptoms of either illness, follow medical guidance.
With these simple steps, you can help ensure that we can all celebrate the joys of the season, then come back to our universities in January recharged and ready for the spring semester.

                December 15, 2022 4:02 PM
			
        To the members of the University of Illinois System community:
The holidays are a time for family and friendships, for nurturing our ties to those who are most important to us.
While many of us will soon disperse to see loved ones away from our campuses, the renewal, reflection and connection that are so much a part of this season of celebration extend to our entire U of I System family.
We are bound together across our three universities by a shared set of commitments – to teaching and learning; to scholarly thought and ideas; to the quest for truth, knowledge and opportunity; to respectful engagement; and to enduring values.
Among these shared values is our strong belief in inclusion – in equity and opportunity for all who seek them and, ultimately, to fairness.
However, we also live in a time of tension and challenge. Discrimination and inequities across society have been and continue to be exposed. They are, sadly, common and stubbornly persistent.
At times, we find such shortcomings at our own universities, leaving some within our U of I System family with the belief that the doors of opportunity are not as widely open for them and that reactions to our differences deprive them of the full sense that they belong here.
So, let us declare once again that racism and discrimination have absolutely no place within this family.
Nor does intolerance based on any of our differences – sex, faith, race, culture, income, geography, politics, appearance and so many others. Embracing and celebrating these differences makes us stronger – as a university system, as a country and as a society.
As members of the University of Illinois System family, we have an obligation to ensure that all are welcome here – that each and every one of us knows, without hesitation or doubt, that we all belong.
I encourage you over the next few weeks to rest and recharge, but also to reflect – and then to join me in the year ahead in recommitting to live the values and ideals that we share.
Until we return in January, I wish you peace and joy throughout this holiday season.
Sincerely,
Tim"

        Dear Colleagues,
As we near the end of the semester, we know this is a challenging time. Exams, deadlines, and continued acts of division and displays of inequity and intolerances in our society can create stress and anxiety.
We ask everyone to be conscious and aware of your own health and wellbeing during this time, and please be vigilant for signs of distress or concern in your students and colleagues. Watch for signs of panic, depression, anxiety, excessive fatigue, avoidance, or confusion as these are all signs that you may need help and should seek assistance.
Students in your classes or laboratories who show signs of panic, depression, anxiety, excessive fatigue (e.g., from academic or personal stressors or COVID-19 vaccine side effects), avoidance, confusion or who report conditions such as their ""mind goes blank,"" may need your help and encouragement in seeking assistance.
If you become concerned about a student, the Student Assistance Center (SAC) can help. Staff in the SAC is available Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. Additionally, the Emergency Dean Program provides a university administrator who is on-call to assist in health or safety emergency situations that occur after business hours and require an immediate university response.

        Dear Colleagues,
I am delighted to introduce the BRAND NEW 2022 – 2023 Chancellor's Staff Excellence Award (CSEA) Program. The CSEA Program combines the Chancellor’s Academic Professional Excellence (CAPE) award and the Chancellor’s Distinguished Staff Award (CDSA) into a unified Chancellor’s staff award program. This approach allows our campus to adopt a single program with one set of rules and protocols to recognize and reward exemplary staff service, establishing university-wide visibility. This also supports campus efforts in fostering one staff community between Academic Professionals and Civil Service employees.
The new program recognizes the importance of the outstanding work of all university staff members who perform a wide range of critical functions for our university. Staff provide crucial administrative support, support our research laboratories and education programs, serve our students, and offer important outreach programs throughout the state and beyond.
Sixteen awards will be distributed based on eight functional categories (up to two awards per category). Nominees are evaluated on four criteria, all of which are located on the award website here. Each winner of the CSEA Award will be honored at a reception, where they will receive a $1,500 award (after taxes) and a commemorative plaque.
The deadline for submitting nominations to the CSEA nomination website, is Friday, January 20, 2023, at 5:00 p.m. If you have any questions, please contact Shari Mickey-Boggs, Senior Associate Chancellor for Human Resources, at smboggs@illinois.edu.
Thank you for your continued support of all employees on our campus and your willingness to help honor their accomplishments.

                November 29, 2022 10:02 AM
			
        Dear Colleagues,
The way we work today has dramatically changed for our university staff since March 2020. Hybrid or remote working options, tools and practices that were seen in rare cases and for a very narrow range of jobs are now as much a part of our operational vocabulary as in-person work. During the past year, as we have been able to move from the acute crisis stage of the pandemic into the employment environment that was reshaped by COVID-19, we have all been learning together how we can permanently and consistently integrate these new modes of working into our university operations. 
Working closely and carefully with our university leadership, deans, administrative unit leaders and members of the campuswide HR Caucus, we have developed new guidelines and recommendations that will normalize workplace flexibility, which includes both hybrid and remote working schedules moving forward. You can find more detailed information on the Illinois Human Resources Workplace Flexibility web pages, but here are some key operational points related to this new guidance:
A hybrid work schedule for Urbana civil service and academic professional staff will be generally defined as three or four days on-site and other days working remotely. Employees working a hybrid schedule must have an approved Remote and Hybrid Work agreement in place.  Agreements will be renewed annually.
Not every job can be done remotely. A list of those classifications by functional category that are not eligible for remote work can be found here.  
Any approval beyond a hybrid three or four days on-site and remaining days remote must have approval by the appropriate dean, vice chancellor, associate chancellor or their designee.   
Fully remote or remote greater than two days may result in employees utilizing a shared space or hoteling space when on campus. Space previously assigned to an employee who is now fully remote or remote more than two days a week may be repurposed to meet unit needs.  Such action may not be immediate but will be incorporated into space planning efforts. Units will provide ways for employees in shared spaces to secure their items in cabinets/drawers.
Working a set schedule/hours when working remotely is expected and should be documented in the remote or hybrid agreement.
If, while working remotely, you will be unavailable for a block of time during your regularly scheduled hours, you are expected to inform your supervisor or teammates just as is expected during on-site work. 
Employees must have privacy and minimized distractions while working remotely.
Employees entering hybrid and remote work arrangements must be available for and participate in phone calls, video meetings and other necessary forms of communication in accordance with the normal demands of the job. Managers shall set expectations for video camera usage when working remotely.
Employees must continue to follow all university policies and procedures, such as using sick and vacation leave when not working or away from work.
Beyond remote or hybrid work, IHR staff is prepared to assist units in exploring options such as flexible schedules. 
Employees working either a hybrid or remote schedule are expected to complete a new form by January 9, 2023 unless they have an approved agreement through August 2023 as we transition to an annual form submission for review in July prior to the start of each new academic year.
These new guidelines are for Urbana staff only and will be effective on January 9, 2023. These do not apply to System Office employees.
We take great pride in our university’s adoption of workplace flexibility. We recognize our ability to provide that flexibility is important to our ability to recruit and to retain the best, brightest and most diverse staff possible. At the same time, our decisions about working modes must always be based on prioritizing face-to-face engagement with our students and support for our faculty.  A ”one size fits all” approach is not possible given our scale and the widely varied jobs, expectations and operational needs of a university of our size and impact. We believe these guidelines will provide the most flexibility while still delivering the services necessary to uphold our academic, scholarly and engagement missions.
We know this transition to normalizing our hybrid working plans will bring new questions. Our IHR staff and human resources partners in our colleges, departments and units will work with you all to find the answers and provide support as we begin this next phase of work here at Illinois and in our society. A revised policy is working its way through the Campus Administrative Manual (CAM) process.
Thank you for your efforts and patience as we have navigated this crisis together and for helping us use those experiences to reimagine what it means to work here at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
Sincerely,
Shari Mickey-Boggs                                                                 Senior Associate Chancellor for Human Resources"

        Dear Campus Community,
 
The Illinois Department of Human Services (IDHS) has made naloxone HCI (a.k.a. NARCAN® nasal spray), an opioid antagonist, more readily available to reverse the effect of opioid overdoses. Distribution programs, beyond medical and trained first responders, have been proven to show a reduction in overdoses demonstrating positive results. 
 
Although our campus has not had a reported overdose, the Champaign-Urbana community has experienced several deaths. 
 
To be proactive, McKinley Health Center is coordinating efforts with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD), to offer NARCAN® in McKinley Health Resource Centers across campus. 
 
NARCAN® Access Locations Include:
McKinley Health Center Pharmacy
Illini Union, lower level in the Computer Lab and Student Space (CLASS)
The vending machine at the Student Dining & Residential Programs Building (SDRP), Ikenberry Commons, mail room area
Students will be allowed access to NARCAN® once per semester. The item will come with instructions and educational information about preventing and treating overdoses. 
 
Doses are available now.
 
A dose of NARCAN® can save lives in an opioid emergency. If you or someone you know currently uses opiates, we suggest you keep a dose of NARCAN® on-hand. Supplies are limited. Please only access a dose if you feel it may be used. We want as many people in our campus community to have access to this potentially lifesaving medication as possible.
 
The medication can be administered by anyone (non-medical professionals included) in accordance with the instructions for use.
 
NARCAN® has no effect on someone who does not have opioids in their system, and it is not a treatment for opioid use disorder.
 
Learn how to reverse opioid overdose with NARCAN® at narcan.com.
 
If you or someone you know is struggling with substance use, call the State's Helpline for Opioids and other Substances at 1-833-234-6343, text ""HELP"" to 833234, or visit HelplineIL.org.

I realize this is a time of year when many fundraising campaigns are in full swing and you have many worthy choices for your charitable dollars. But I am extremely proud to say we have raised more than $1 million so far and that is an enormous accomplishment. Thank you to the thousands who have already given and my deepest gratitude to the unit and section leaders who have worked tirelessly to make this campaign a success.

        Dear colleagues,
I am delighted to announce my recommendation of Dr. Marie Lynn Miranda as the new chancellor of the University of Illinois Chicago and vice president of the University of Illinois System, pending approval by our Board of Trustees. Dr. Miranda served as provost of the University of Notre Dame through 2021 and remains a member of its faculty as a professor of applied and computational mathematics and statistics and director of the Children’s Environmental Health Initiative.
Following a comprehensive search, Dr. Miranda’s track record of academic leadership, her commitment to excellence and her longstanding belief in the importance of access and equity positioned her at the top of what was a very strong field of candidates.
Dr. Miranda’s service as provost at Notre Dame followed leadership roles at Rice University, where she was also provost, as well as the University of Michigan and Duke University.
She is a Phi Beta Kappa, summa cum laude graduate of Duke University, where she earned her BA in mathematics and economics and was named a Truman Scholar. She has a PhD and MA from Harvard University, where she held a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.
Dr. Miranda and her husband, Chris Geron, have three adult children, Mariel Geron, Thompson Geron, and Viviana Geron, as well as two English setters and several hundred thousand honeybees that they raise on a family farm.
Later this morning, news of Dr. Miranda’s recommended appointment will be released to news media and the public. You can read the news release below.
In her letter of application, Dr. Miranda wrote that, while she enjoyed her role at Notre Dame, during the pandemic she found herself particularly drawn to public higher education and its ability to transform lives at scale.
This is our calling across the University of Illinois System – to serve the public and to do so at a scale that can transform an entire state and the lives of all of its citizens.
I welcome Dr. Miranda to UIC and the U of I System and look forward to working together to answer this calling that all of us share.
Best wishes,
Tim
Marie Lynn Miranda named chancellor of the University of Illinois ChicagoMiranda joins UIC after serving as provost at Notre Dame, Rice; brings focus on access and equity
CHICAGO – Marie Lynn Miranda, the former provost of the University of Notre Dame and a leader in the drive to make higher education more inclusive, has been named chancellor of the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) and a vice president of the University of Illinois System.
Pending formal approval by the Board of Trustees at its Nov. 17 meeting, Miranda will take office on July 5, 2023, as the 10th chancellor of UIC. She will succeed Chancellor Michael Amiridis, who became president of the University of South Carolina in June.
Miranda, 59, served as provost at Notre Dame through 2021 and remains a member of the faculty in its Department of Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics. As provost, she led the private university’s academic response to the COVID-19 pandemic; helped drive efforts to increase faculty and student diversity, resulting in the most diverse first-year class in school history in 2021; started a transformational leaders program to provide resources to students from under-served backgrounds; and led a bottom up strategic planning process that engaged more than 600 members of the faculty.
Miranda brings a wide range of other leadership experience at Rice University, the University of Michigan and Duke University to her new role as chancellor of UIC and its nearly 34,000 students and 13,000 faculty and staff.
“It is an honor to be chosen to lead one of the country’s great urban universities and to serve this global city and its people,” Miranda said. “I look forward to learning from and working with students, faculty and staff as we work collaboratively with our community partners to meet the pressing challenges and opportunities before us. Together we can provide life-changing educational programs at scale, while fostering the world-class research and engagement our city, state, country and world need.”
University of Illinois System President Tim Killeen said Miranda’s deep experience as a higher education innovator dedicated to access, excellence and community engagement will serve UIC well.
“Marie Lynn comes to UIC and the University of Illinois System as a champion for higher education, a believer in the undisputable impact that a great university can have on the lives of its students, their families and the communities it serves,” Killeen said. “She has been a leader in making certain that higher education is accessible to more and more people, a public good that should be available to students from all backgrounds and income levels. I look forward to working with her to advance UIC and the U of I System.”
At Notre Dame, Miranda is also director of the Children's Environmental Health Initiative (CEHI), a research, education and outreach organization committed to fostering environments where all people can prosper. The initiative is best known for its work on childhood lead exposure – contributing to the CDC’s decision to set a more protective standard for childhood blood lead levels, developing strategies for combatting lead in drinking water, and identifying lead in aviation gasoline as a contributor to elevated blood lead levels. CEHI’s most recent work focuses on racial residential segregation and the ways segregated neighborhoods experience greater exposure to social and environmental stressors, which in turn drives health and educational disparities.
Before joining Notre Dame in 2020, Miranda was provost at Rice University from 2015-19. She was responsible for all aspects of the university’s academic, research, scholarly and creative programs, supported by a roughly $700 million annual budget. While at Rice, Miranda also led planning and implementation of $230 million in investments focused on areas such as molecular nanotechnology, data sciences, neuroengineering, inequities and inequalities and general research competitiveness. Her efforts at Rice also included providing a comprehensive set of programs for students from under-served backgrounds – an initiative which substantially closed graduation and time to degree gaps.
At Michigan, Miranda was dean of what was then the School of Natural Resources and Environment from 2012-15, restructuring the doctoral program and improving degree-completion metrics; developing data systems to support evidence-based decision-making in admissions and advising; and reinvigorating the department’s alumni relations operation.
Prior to her work at Michigan, Miranda spent 21 years as a member of the faculty at Duke University, including nine years as director of undergraduate programs for the Nicholas School of the Environment. She also was principal investigator of a research laboratory with roughly 30 full-time staff and 40-plus faculty collaborators. Over the course of her research career, Miranda has been principal investigator or co-principal investigator on over $75 million in research funding.
She is a Phi Beta Kappa, summa cum laude graduate of Duke University, where she earned her Bachelor of Arts in mathematics and economics and was named a Truman Scholar. She has a PhD and Master of Arts from Harvard University, where she held a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.
Miranda is also a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
She was chosen from five finalists and a pool of 40 well-qualified applicants. A committee chaired by UIC Interim Provost and Professor Karen Colley advised system Interim Executive Vice President Avijit Ghosh and Killeen in the search.

        Dear Campus Community,
Today is National First-Generation College Celebration Day. To all Illinois first-gen students, I commend you for being one of the first in your family to attend college! Your commitment to better yourselves, the lives of your families, and those of your classmates and society is evidence of your strong character and conviction.
Institutions and education agencies nationwide participate in First-Generation College Celebration Day to highlight the achievements of students, educators, and alumni who are the first members of their families to pursue college degrees and to encourage this critical and resilient population to continue thriving.
The first national First-Generation College Celebration Day occurred in 2017 when the nonprofit Council for Opportunity in Education (COE) encouraged institutions nationwide on or around November 8 to celebrate first-generation college students or graduates. 
COE selected November 8 to honor the anniversary of the signing of the Higher Education Act of 1965. This landmark legislation emerged as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty. It ushered in programs, particularly the Federal TRIO programs, necessary for postsecondary access, retention, and completion for low-income, potential first-generation college graduates.
For more information about First-Generation College Celebration Day, click here.
While, I still have your attention, are YOU a proud first-generation faculty or staff member like I am? Are you looking for a mentor that identifies as first-gen, or you just want to learn more about campus resources and/or programs and events, then join the first-gen online directory!  Learn more about the first-gen directory and then complete the interest form and upload your photo.

        Dear Colleagues,
As we continue to navigate the semester, we know this is a challenging time. Exams, deadlines, upcoming mid-term elections, continued acts of division and displays of inequity and intolerances in our society can create stress and anxiety.
We ask everyone to be conscious and aware of your own health and wellbeing during this time, and please be vigilant for signs of distress or concern in your students and colleagues. Watch for signs of panic, depression, anxiety, excessive fatigue, avoidance, or confusion as these are all signs that you may need help and should seek assistance.
Students in your classes or laboratories who show signs of panic, depression, anxiety, excessive fatigue (e.g., from academic or personal stressors or COVID-19 vaccine side effects), avoidance, confusion or who report conditions such as their ""mind goes blank,"" may need your help and encouragement in seeking assistance.
If you become concerned about a student, the Student Assistance Center (SAC) can help. Staff in the SAC is available Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. Additionally, the Emergency Dean Program provides a university administrator who is on-call to assist in health or safety emergency situations that occur after business hours and require an immediate university response.

        Dear colleagues,
I’m pleased to announce that Nicholas P. Jones will be the new University of Illinois System executive vice president and vice president for academic affairs.
Pending approval by the Board of Trustees, which will consider his appointment at its Nov. 17 meeting, Jones will join the U of I System on Jan. 3, 2023, from Pennsylvania State University.
Jones will succeed Avijit Ghosh, who has served as interim executive vice president and vice president for academic affairs since July 2021. I am grateful to Avijit for his strong leadership and dedication to excellence, which have served the system, our three universities and their students well since 2011. We will honor his 40-plus-year career as he nears his December retirement.
Jones, a civil engineering professor, is a special advisor to Penn State's president after serving as the university's executive vice president and provost for nine years, beginning in 2013.
As Penn State’s chief academic officer, Jones led the development of the strategic plan that guides the university system today, provided direction during the COVID-19 pandemic and worked to strategically align resources in his role as the lead budget executive.
Prior to joining Penn State, Jones served as the Benjamin T. Rome Dean of the Whiting School of Engineering at Johns Hopkins University from 2008-13 and, significantly, was head of the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign from 2002-04. Some of you may remember him from that time.
Jones received his PhD in civil engineering in 1986 and his master’s degree in 1981, both from the California Institute of Technology. He completed his undergraduate work at The University of Auckland in New Zealand.
The news release below announcing his appointment will be shared with news media later today.
I am confident Jones’ expertise and drive will enrich the experiences of students and faculty throughout our system and help us to continue to deliver the kind of excellence we are known for at a scale that serves all of Illinois. Please join me in welcoming him to the U of I System.
Sincerely,
Tim 
Nicholas Jones named executive vice president of U of I SystemJones moves from Penn State to succeed Avijit Ghosh in No. 2 system role
URBANA, Ill. – Nicholas P. Jones has been appointed as the new executive vice president and vice president for academic affairs of the University of Illinois System, President Tim Killeen announced today.
Jones will serve as second-in-command to the president, senior operating officer and chief academic officer of Illinois’ flagship university system.
He comes to the U of I System from Pennsylvania State University, where he is a special advisor to the president after serving as executive vice president and provost for nine years, beginning in 2013. Pending approval by the University of Illinois Board of Trustees, expected at the board’s meeting on Nov. 17, Jones will begin his new role on Jan. 3, 2023.
Jones will replace Avijit Ghosh, who plans to retire after serving as interim executive vice president and vice president for academic affairs since July 2021.
Killeen said Jones’ experience as a leader in both academic and budget matters at Penn State makes him the ideal person to assume his new role at the U of I System.
“Nicholas Jones brings to his new role here decades of leadership experience and a deep understanding of how to foster excellence at scale across a multi-university system. I’m pleased he has agreed to join us and look forward to working together for the people of Illinois,” Killeen said. “I also want to express my deepest gratitude to Avijit Ghosh for his decades of service and leadership to the University of Illinois System. He has been a trusted colleague and is a dear friend.”
Jones said he is honored to join the U of I System two decades after serving as head of the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). He led the department from 2002-04.
“The University of Illinois System is a leader in public higher education, opening doors to opportunity and helping to meet the economic and social challenges facing this great state,” Jones said. “I believe the U of I System is poised to serve as a transformative and defining trailblazer, a change agent. I look forward to helping these three extraordinary universities thrive in the years ahead.”
Ghosh congratulated Jones.
“Nicholas Jones brings with him a long track record of innovation and a vision that has helped elevate Penn State. Because of his role as chief academic officer there, he is well suited to maintain and enhance the high quality of education and research found across the U of I System,” Ghosh said. “He will serve the students, faculty and staff at our universities well.” 
As Penn State’s chief academic officer, Jones oversaw all academic units, including colleges, schools and 24 campuses, as well as major academic support units. He led the development of the strategic plan that guides the university system today, provided direction during the COVID-19 pandemic and worked to strategically align resources in his role as Penn State’s lead budget executive.
Prior to joining Penn State, Jones served as the Benjamin T. Rome Dean of the Whiting School of Engineering at The Johns Hopkins University from 2008.
Jones received his PhD in civil engineering in 1986 and his master’s degree in 1981, both from the California Institute of Technology. He completed his undergraduate work at The University of Auckland in New Zealand.
Before serving as interim executive vice president and vice president for academic affairs, Ghosh had served as vice president/chief financial officer and comptroller for the University of Illinois System since 2018. He previously announced plans to retire once his interim duties ended.
Ghosh joined the U of I System in 2001 as dean of the College of Business and a professor of business administration at UIUC. He has since served in a variety of senior leadership positions that also include heading the system’s economic development efforts and the University of Illinois Hospital.

        Dear Faculty and Staff,
Over the past few years, the world has faced a sustained period of global challenges, political turmoil and natural disasters that have dramatically impacted the ability of our international colleagues to engage in scholarly pursuits within their own countries. To help address these challenges, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is now a sustaining member of Scholars at Risk (SAR), a global network of higher education institutions and associations dedicated to protecting scholars and promoting academic freedom around the world. Through our partnership with SAR, Illinois has committed to supporting scholars who are facing severe threats to their freedoms and well-being.
A committee of faculty and students has been formally charged to guide and support the university’s efforts to host scholars affiliated with SAR for visits up to one year in duration. Colleen Murphy, Roger and Stephany Joslin Professor of Law and director of the Women & Gender in Global Perspectives Program, has agreed to chair the Illinois Scholars at Risk Committee (ISAR).
Hosting scholars enriches departmental and broader campus communities and contributes to public education and engagement. The university has committed funds to support departmental efforts in hosting visiting scholars at risk. Interested units and departments should work with college leadership and visit the Illinois Global Institute (IGI) website to learn more about hosting requirements, including the application.
Thank you for your support in this new partnership as we work to further our educational, scholarly and global missions and host scholars in need.

                October 10, 2022 8:01 AM
			
        Dear campus community member:
In order to maintain an effective emergency response and evacuation plan, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign recently completed a test including two components: a drill and an exercise. The test was designed to challenge our emergency response procedures and how we notify you of a threat to our campus community. We are informing you of these efforts so you have more information about our plans to protect you in the event of an emergency, and to comply with disclosure mandates set forth in the federal Clery Act.
On Sept. 6, we initiated a test of our Illini-Alert emergency notification system. The drill was announced ahead of time by a mass email to campus and an Eweek notification to faculty and staff. The Illini-Alert system sent an email to the campus email addresses of all active students, faculty and staff. Those who have registered alternate email addresses also received a notification. Those who have registered a cellphone number received a text message during this drill.
Illini-Alert messages are also posted to Twitter and digital signage throughout campus buildings. This approach increases the speed and breadth of our distribution of emergency notifications, and it provides alternate notification methods that will continue to function even if one system fails to work properly.
For the second component, university stakeholders and emergency responders gathered on Sept. 23 at Illinois Fire Service Institute and virtually for a functional exercise. Those involved were presented with a scenario involving a hypothetical “complex coordinated attack” and active shooter event affecting the campus. The exercise tested various components of the Campus Emergency Operations Plan, including evacuation procedures.
This test was conducted to ensure we have a robust response plan in the event of a campus emergency, and that our notifications will reach you in a timely and effective manner. If you have not signed up to receive Illini-Alert text messages, please visit emergency.illinois.edu to register.
To view the university’s emergency response and evacuation procedures, please visit go.illinois.edu/EmergencyResponse.
The Division of Public Safety is committed to maintaining a safe and secure campus environment where education, research and public service can flourish. We can only do so with the assistance of our community, and we hope this information is useful to our campus partners.

Brian R. Brauer

        The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign landscape contributes powerfully to the character of the campus and its excellence as a land grant institution with global impact. Through thoughtful planning and design guidance, the first-ever Campus Landscape Master Plan (CLMP) ensures our treasured landscape will thrive for many years.
The CLMP will shape the vision of a future outdoor environment that will protect natural heritage, strengthen ecosystems, enhance shared experiences and learning opportunities, and provide a welcoming experience for students, faculty, staff, alums, community members, and guests.
An executive summary of the CLMP and a video of the plan's concepts and designs are available on the Facilities & Services website. We strongly encourage you to share these items with others to help them know about this inaugural effort. The plan builds on concepts developed in the Campus Master Plan and Resilient Landscape Strategy and implements sustainability objectives established in the Illinois Climate Action Plan (iCAP) to meet the Climate Leadership Commitments, including being carbon neutral as soon as possible and building resilience to climate change in our community.
Thank you to all contributors who helped develop the CLMP: core committee members, unit stakeholders, and the many individuals who guided us and provided feedback during the various input sessions and public forum. We also want to thank the plan consultants, Design Workshop and their project team, for their hard work and dedication throughout the process.
As you read the CLMP and view the district recommendations, please remember the plan will be a living document that immediately serves as a foundation to help guide the projects and initiatives that will shape the future of our campus. Ongoing collaborations and partnerships are critical to preserving, maintaining, and improving our campus landscape moving forward. If you have suggestions or questions, please contact University Landscape Architect Brent Lewis bcl@illinois.edu.
We are excited to begin incorporating the CLMP strategies into ongoing work and turn these ideas into reality.

For more than 150 years, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has been changing the world. As we look ahead to the future, we are pleased to unveil “Vision 2030: Illinois’ Global Strategy,” a seven-year plan for enhancing global learning and engagement at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
Vision 2030 emerged from a multi-year process, beginning with the 2018 Globalization task force that was charged with developing recommendations for the campus strategic plan, The Next 150. Building on that foundation, Vision 2030 outlines specific actions we will take to expand and create comprehensive global learning, teaching, research and engagement opportunities for our students, faculty and staff—dedicating significant efforts and resources to engagement on the African continent, Latin America, and parts of Asia that are currently underrepresented in the university’s global profile.
We will celebrate the launch of this plan during the Global Summit, a symposium that brings together international and national keynote speakers, as well as campus experts, in engaging panel discussions and networking sessions. The Global Summit will be held on Wednesday, October 19, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. at the I-Hotel & Conference Center. Registration is required by Oct. 11 to attend and space is limited.
If you are unable to attend the Global Summit, we invite you to explore the Vision 2030 website or tune in to the Global Summit livestream on October 19 at https://go.illinois.edu/GlobalSummit.
If you will need disability-related accommodations in order to participate in the program, please contact Illinois International (217-333-6104) or international@illinois.edu. Early requests are strongly encouraged to allow sufficient time to meet your access needs.
We look forward to working with the campus community to achieve the goals outlined in Vision 2030.

        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
I’m excited to announce that our university is launching the planning phase for Boldly Illinois: Strategic Plan 2030, and I invite you to participate in a collaborative and comprehensive process to lay the groundwork for our next leap forward as one of the nation’s top public research universities.
The planning process starts with a Strategic Planning Summit on Oct. 27 at 1 p.m. in the Illini Union Ballroom focused on the future of higher education, where two extraordinary leaders of higher education, Freeman Hrabowski and Ruth Watkins, will share their perspectives. Dr. Hrabowski recently retired as the president of the University of Maryland Baltimore County and Dr. Watkins is currently president of Strata Impact, a national social impact organization that aims to help all students succeed beyond completion of credentials and degrees, a position she took after serving as the president of the University of Utah.   
As most of you probably know, both have special connections to Illinois. Dr. Hrabowski earned his Ph.D. here and Dr. Watkins was long-time faculty member and dean. We thought their unique insights as both higher education leaders and their deep connections to our university made them the perfect people to help us plan boldly for the next phase of our progress. Learn more about our speakers here.
Besides attending the summit, you can also participate in the planning process by:
Learning about the successes of The Next 150 by visiting the Stories of Impact website where the university has documented examples of past successes and stories that illustrate the goals and priorities from our current plan.
Visiting the planning website for Boldly Illinois: Strategic Plan 2030 to familiarize yourself with the planning process, timeline and leadership teams. More information will be added throughout this year’s planning process, so continue to check the site for updates.
Providing your feedback on any or all of the four major goals on this page of the planning website:
Foster Scholarship, Discovery, and Innovation
Provide Transformative Learning Experiences
Make a Significant and Visible Societal Impact
Steward Current Resources and Generate Additional Resources for Strategic Initiatives

We cannot accomplish our full potential without planning carefully and strategically, and I sincerely hope you accept this invitation to be an active participant in this process to create our shared vision for the future. Thank you in advance for your participation.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                September 29, 2022 6:02 AM
			
        Dear campus community member:
Each year around this time, we publish our Annual Security and Fire Safety Report which includes statistics from the previous three years concerning crime that occurred on campus, in certain off-campus buildings or on property owned or controlled by the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The report additionally includes statistics for fires which occurred in on-campus student housing, fire safety policies and procedures, institutional policies concerning campus security, and other safety information.
Creating and maintaining a safe community is a responsibility that the Division of Public Safety and Campus Code Compliance and Fire Safety take very seriously. However, we cannot do it alone. Crime and fire prevention is a community effort, and you are our most valuable public safety resource. By reviewing this report, you are partnering with us to take the necessary steps to look out for yourself and others and to create a safer campus community for everyone.
Toward this end, and in compliance with federal regulations and the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Crime Statistics Act, a copy of the 2022 University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Annual Security and Fire Safety Report is available online.
You can access the report at go.illinois.edu/ASFSR.
In assembling the 2022 report, we discovered errors in the fire safety statistics released in 2021 and 2020. To correct those errors, we have published revisions to the Annual Security and Fire Safety Reports released in previous years. The revised reports include the corrected statistics and a description of what was corrected. You can access the revised reports at go.illinois.edu/ASFSRrevisions.
A hard copy of the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report may be obtained by visiting the U. of I. Public Safety Building at 1110 W. Springfield Ave., Urbana, IL 61801, or by contacting 217-333-1216. You may also review the Daily Crime Log at the front desk of the U. of I. Public Safety Building or on the Division of Public Safety website.
In addition to reviewing this report, there are other important steps you can take to enhance your own safety on campus:
Sign up for Illini-Alert text messages by visiting emergency.illinois.edu.
Review campus safety measures at police.illinois.edu/safety.
Take a minute to prepare for emergencies at police.illinois.edu/safe.
Review sexual violence and misconduct resources available to the campus community at wecare.illinois.edu.
We hope that you review these important resources and use the information to promote your own awareness. Together, we can continue to make the campus community a safer place where education, research and public service can flourish.

        Dear Colleagues,
Today marks the beginning of the 2022 Campus Charitable Fund Drive (CCFD). This year’s annual workplace giving campaign will run from September 26 to November 16.
Since March 2020, university employees and CCFD unit leaders have transitioned fundraising activity to being almost completely digital. Despite not having in-person events or initiatives, I am proud to say we have continued to increase our giving each year. In 2021, we raised almost $1.4 million and this year, we have set a goal of $1.5 million in funds from our university community.
Over the course of the next eight weeks, you can learn about a wide variety of agencies and causes that resonate with you. You may have your current payroll deduction automatically roll over to this year’s campaign or you may go into the giving platform to change your current pledge. If you prefer, you can give a one-time gift via check or directly donate to a chosen charity. Explore the CCFD website to learn more about the 700 charities and how to give.
The continuous success of the CCFD would not be possible without the efforts of our section and unit leaders across campus. These individuals take time out of their daily schedule to rally colleagues and share about non-profits in our community and beyond. I am extremely grateful for these volunteers who are going to help us achieve this year’s goal. Please reach out to your unit leader with any questions, suggestions or concerns regarding the campaign.
Thank you to all who have contributed through the Campus Charitable Fund Drive in the past and to those who will be giving in the future. Let us continue to do our part in transforming challenge to success.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Colleagues, 
The revised system Social Security Number (SSN) Policy is now available online. The previous version of the policy was written in 2011 and was out of date with both current practice and changes in Illinois legislation. The revision reflects our current practices and procedures and incorporates requirements from the Illinois Identity Protection Act. It also eliminates material no longer relevant and provides clear guidance to units processing SSNs. The newly published policy is based on input from a wide group of stakeholders and was approved by relevant administrators, registrars, and privacy officers at the three universities, the system offices, and the hospital. Questions or assistance with policy implementation can be directed to the SSN Committee (ssn@uillinois.edu).
I would like to express my appreciation to those who contributed to the policy revision.
Sincerely,

We are pleased to announce that the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has selected 10 proposed projects to receive $14.2 million over the next three years in the fourth round of funding for the Investment for Growth program. This is the first group of funded projects since the COVID-19 pandemic, and we are excited to resume investing in proposals and ideas that promise to enhance the visibility and impact of our institution.
Since the Investment for Growth program was created in 2018, our university has invested more than $78 million to provide seed funding for projects that generate revenue, advance our missions and address areas of high and emerging student demand. A few examples of successful funded projects include the creation of the Campus Instructional Facility, rapid growth of innovative online programs such as iMBA and iMSA, cross-college programs such as CS+X and, in this latest cohort, several new online programs for non-traditional students that promise to expand access and equity to an Illinois education.
We are proud to provide central support to encourage Colleges to dream big, think differently and take risks. If you have an idea for an Investment for Growth proposal, we encourage you to talk to your department head and dean.

                September 19, 2022 11:02 AM
			
        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
It is with heavy hearts that we share the news of the passing of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Physics Professor Nick Holonyak Jr. yesterday morning. Nick was 93, and we have been so fortunate that he and his wife, Kay, have been part of our university family and our local community for decades, and the thoughts of all of us are with her in this very sad time.  
Nick first came to this university as an undergraduate student, hailing from a small, rural Illinois town. He was the first in his family to attend college. He came from a coal mining family and his parents hoped for a better and safer path for their son that would not subject him to the hardships, dangers and darkness of a life toiling underground. Nick didn’t just discover a brighter life and career for himself; he, quite literally, went on to bring a new light to every person on our planet with the invention of the visible LED in 1962. And the lights of State Farm Center and Memorial Stadium will glow red tonight in commemoration of that historic discovery.   
The world has lost one of its great inventors. But it is far more personal for those who were lucky enough to meet him, learn from him, or just sit and drink a cup of very strong coffee with him. They have lost a legendary member of our university family this weekend.
One of the earliest researchers in semiconductor materials and a pioneer in optoelectronics, Nick is most famously credited for developing the first practical visible-spectrum LED, now commonly used worldwide in light bulbs, device displays and lasers. He also contributed to technologies in household dimmer switches, lasers that run CD and DVD players, fiber-optic communication lines and many other electronics and communications devices. He started his professional career with Bell Labs, but returned to Illinois as a faculty member, where he earned his academic degrees.
In addition to his research, he was best known for his excellence in mentorship and dedication to his students. For four decades, he guided the education and research of Illinois doctoral students, many of whom have also made significant contributions to semiconductor and LED technology.
He believed in leading by example, working in the lab alongside his students. You could set your watch by him — arriving early, working out at Kenney Gym before lunch each day, walking to the Illini Union after lunch to buy the local newspaper and breaking for coffee each weekday with his students, where he shared amusing stories about his own life, his advisor and friend John Bardeen and the pioneering luminaries of electronics that he knew and worked with throughout the years.
Considered one of the greatest inventors of the 20th century, he always remained remarkably “human.” His brilliance, determination, character and humility touched many and profoundly shaped the trajectory of scholarship, discovery and innovation at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and The Grainger College of Engineering in ways that will extend generations beyond his time with us.
Over the years, many have heard Nick say in different ways and sometimes blunt words: “Illinois is where people come to get hard work done.”
We are so fortunate and grateful that this was the starting point of so much of the hard, impossible and truly world-changing work of Nick Holonyak Jr.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellorRashid BashirDean, The Grainger College of Engineering"

One important way we manifest our commitment to a diverse and inclusive campus is through our affirmative action and nondiscrimination policies. The University prohibits discrimination and harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, disability, national origin, citizenship status, ancestry, age, order of protection status, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, arrest record status, unfavorable discharge from the military, or status as a protected veteran. These protections apply to all members of the campus community. This includes admissions, enrollment, and provision of services, programs, and activities, and all aspects of employment, including but not limited to recruitment, selection, promotion, transfer, merit increases, salary, training and development, and separation.
In addition, as a part of our affirmative action plan, consistent with state and federal laws, we undertake good faith efforts to increase the representation of women, minorities, individuals with disabilities, and veterans among our faculty and staff. These steps include proactively reaching out to people of color, women, protected veterans and individuals with a disability to apply for jobs on campus, ensuring that our selection and hiring processes are free of bias and discrimination, and monitoring our progress. I am committed to our affirmative action plan as a critical way to further equal employment opportunity and ensure that our teaching, research, and service efforts reflect the diversity that exists in our community and beyond.
Please see the Office for Access & Equity website to learn more about OAE’s broader services related to equity, affirmative action and accessibility, and to review the nondiscrimination policy and sexual misconduct policy and associated procedures for discrimination, harassment or retaliation. You can submit a discrimination or harassment claim through the university’s online reporting forms. Retaliation against any person for exercising their rights under these policies is strictly prohibited. 
The Accessibility and Accommodations Division of the Office for Access & Equity facilitates disability, religious and pregnancy/parenting accommodations for all faculty, staff, undergraduate and graduate student employees, as well as job applicants. To request a reasonable accommodation, employees can complete the online accommodation request form. The Division engages in an interactive process to determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation for each person. The division also provides advice, consultation and educational programming to increase awareness and inclusion of individuals with disabilities.
Students can learn more about academic supports and accommodations services by contacting Disability Resources & Educational Services. Students also have the right to request accommodations for religious observances and can learn more from the Office of the Dean of Students.
We recently shared an update regarding Title IX and our commitment to prevent and respond to sexual misconduct. Please visit the We Care website to learn more about confidential and non-confidential resources, university policies, disciplinary procedures, rights and options and additional information related to the prevention, reporting, and response to sexual misconduct.
It is my firm commitment to ensure that equal opportunity and access will be provided throughout our university to all current and prospective students and employees. I encourage you to learn more and get involved in our effort to maintain a university community where everyone has the opportunity to learn, collaborate, and thrive.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                September 12, 2022 3:02 PM
			
        Hello from the Student Sustainability Committee (SSC)!
Do you want to see more sustainability efforts on campus? The SSC can help turn your environmental aspirations into reality. Please read on to learn about our history, funding, recent accomplishments, and how to get involved!
As a student-led organization, our goal is to provide financial support for projects that promote environmental stewardship and student engagement at UIUC. The Green Fund permits this funding and is composed of two student-initiated fees: the Sustainable Campus Environment Fee ($12.06/student per semester) and the Cleaner Energy Technologies Fee ($2/student per semester).
The committee was formed in 2002 by a group of passionate students fighting for clean energy on campus and has since expanded its scope to include all facets of sustainability. Today, we are an interdisciplinary team of 18 enthusiastic student-voting members as well as many staff and faculty members. Over the past 20 years, the SSC has proudly dedicated $15.55 million to 316 individual projects, which have significantly improved campus sustainability and engagement. Such projects have included Eco-Illini, Solar Decathlon, Red Oak Rain Garden, Bevier Cafe herb garden, the Illini Union’s recycling bins, CIF’s geothermal system, and many more! Each of these projects falls under one of the SSC’s Working Groups: Energy, Transportation & Infrastructure, Education & Justice, Food & Waste, Energy, and Land, Water, & Air. Be sure to look for the SSC logo on campus to see some of our funded projects!
Because the SSC receives funding from students to be used for students, it’s essential to provide opportunities for engagement and share our achievements with those who make the SSC possible: you!
Here are some ways to get involved with the SSC:
Attend our open house to learn more about the SSC and get involved.
The open house will be held on Thursday, September 15 from 6-8 pm.
You can attend the open house virtually (details will be distributed via our mailing list and on our website) or in person at the Campus Instructional Facility (CIF) Room 2039.

Reimagine Our Future Competition: The SSC is running the second annual Reimagine Our Future Student Sustainability Competition. All we need is YOU! If you have a passion for sustainability, we encourage you to submit an entry promoting one or more of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. The top prize will be $2,000 dollars! The deadline for registration is September 19. Learn more about Reimagine Our Future.
Submit a project application to turn your sustainable vision into a reality. The deadline to submit a Step 1 Project Proposal is October 14. Student-led applications are accepted on a rolling basis. Find out more about applying for funding.
Become a general member and attend biweekly working group meetings for Energy, Transportation & Infrastructure, Education & Justice, Food & Waste, Energy, and/or Land, Water, & Air. Review the Working Group meeting schedule.
Sign up for our mailing list and follow us on social media!

Recent Accomplishments
 Over the last few years, SSC has expanded our goals to include increased sustainability outreach and programming. In October 2021, we co-hosted a month-long Student Sustainability Summit that included Green Quad Day, the Tuesday Talks at Bevier Cafe seminar series, a movie night, tours of university facilities, teach-ins, and a climate strike. We also programmed many Earth Month activities throughout April, hosting another Green Quad Day, more Tuesday Talks, and a showing of The Lorax at the Illini Union. For more updates on SSC’s programming, join our mailing list or check out our calendar. 
Some other initiatives that we had the privilege of working with and funding in the previous year include:
The first-ever Sustainability Grammys to recognize all the amazing work that environmental RSOs do on campus, co-hosted by iSEE’s Greener Campus Office
The development of a single-use plastic reuse and elimination protocol at the Brinkworth Lab
The Sustainable Lab Network, which will compile a database of sustainability education resources
Fume hood upgrades in Morrill Hall to decrease energy demand
The Sustainability Mural Project to highlight the university's sustainability initiatives
A collection of proposed, completed, and ongoing SSC projects can be found on the iCAP Portal.
Getting involved in the SSC is a great way for students like you to make a difference and have your voice heard. 
We look forward to seeing new and familiar faces!

                September 12, 2022 1:02 PM
			
        Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,
I am pleased to announce the recipients of the 2022-23 Call to Action to Address Racism & Social Injustice Research Program, a $2 million annual commitment by our university to respond to the critical need for universities across our nation to prioritize research focused on systemic racial inequities. During this second year of the program, 25 projects were funded in three research focus areas: systemic racism and social justice; law enforcement and criminal justice reform; and disparities in health and health care.
The breadth of this year’s funded projects reflects a commitment to research that centers the needs of the communities we serve throughout our state and nation, from more equitable outcomes through the juvenile justice system, to the impact of social infrastructures and the built environment on mental health and wellbeing, to support for foster care providers.
These projects represent 17 departments and reporting units in seven colleges and administrative units. Awards this year range from $25,000 to $75,000. In total, $1.49 million in research funds will be distributed during this second year of funding. A full list of projects and descriptions is available at go.illinois.edu/CallToActionProjects.
Each Call to Action research funding year concludes with a symposium to share project results and recognize the extraordinary accomplishments of the project leaders. The impact of the first year of funding will be presented during the inaugural Research Symposium, October 6 and 7, 2022. Opening this symposium will be a keynote conversation with Dr. Ibram X. Kendi, Director of the Center for Antiracist Research at Boston University, and one of America’s foremost historians and leading antiracist scholars.
Dr. Kendi will be in conversation with Vice Chancellor Sean Garrick on Thursday, October 6 at 5:30 pm in Knight Auditorium at the Spurlock Museum. Friday, October 7, will feature research presentations and poster sessions at the Levis Faculty Center, showcasing the work of the 22 funded projects during the first year of the Call to Action Research Program. More details about how to register for the symposium will be available soon.
Please join me in recognizing each project leader and community partner, and their deep commitment to research that addresses the pervasive barriers to justice and equity in our nation. I encourage you to explore these second-year projects of the Call to Action Research Program and to attend the research symposium in October.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Faculty, Staff and Graduate Students,
As we begin our fall semester, we are also launching the search to hire our next permanent Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost.
After consultation and collaboration with the Senate and with our academic deans, I have formally charged a committee of faculty, students and staff to guide our search for the next provost. Jeff Brown, Dean of the Gies College of Business, has agreed to chair the committee. The international executive search firm Isaacson, Miller will be assisting the committee in its work. Thank you to Dean Brown for chairing this search and to all of the faculty, staff and students who have agreed to serve on this committee.
The committee membership is listed here, along with a link to the full charge letter.

I have asked the committee to work carefully, but with urgency, to permanently fill this critical leadership position. I am hopeful we can conduct this process over the course of this semester and have the new candidate in place as soon as possible. However, the overriding goal of this search is to find the best candidate for our university’s future – so that is what will determine the final timeline for this process. As you know, pending approval by the Board of Trustees, William Bernhard will serve as our interim provost. I am confident his leadership throughout this transition will ensure our academic enterprise continues to grow and thrive.
I look forward to meeting the candidates for what I believe is one of the top academic leadership positions in American public higher education today.

        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
The Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) has announced they will be hosting COVID-19 bivalent vaccination clinics for Champaign County residents next week. Individuals aged 50 and older are currently eligible, and individuals aged 12 and older will be eligible beginning Sept. 14. Both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will be available.
On September 1, 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) endorsed the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ (ACIP) recommendations for use of updated COVID-19 boosters from Pfizer-BioNTech for people ages 12 years and older and from Moderna for people ages 18 years and older. The updated COVID-19 boosters add Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 spike protein components to the current vaccine composition, helping to restore protection that has waned since previous vaccination by targeting variants that are more transmissible and immune-evading. Learn more about bivalent boosters here.
Eligibility
Champaign County residents aged 50 and older are currently eligible.
Champaign County residents aged 12 and older will be eligible beginning Sept. 14.
It must be two months after the completion of your primary vaccine series (first and second dose) OR two months after your last booster shot.

        Dear Faculty and Staff,
I am excited to announce we are launching a multi-year $50 million strategic faculty hiring initiative to drive excellence in teaching, innovation and discovery.
The Next 150 Strategic Plan identified growing the number of excellent faculty on our campus as a top priority and set aside significant resources to help address that objective. Those plans were put on hold to deal with the effects of the pandemic. It is now time to reinvigorate our commitment to increasing the number of tenure-stream faculty on our campus.  
Under this initiative, colleges will have opportunities to request non-recurring support for additional hires in strategic areas that advance the university’s mission. 
We expect these resources will be used to pursue faculty who enhance research and innovation, accelerate the discovery of solutions to complex global challenges, drive excellence in teaching, contribute to a diverse, equitable and inclusive community and foster collaborations between the university and the Discovery Partners Institute, the Illinois Innovation Network and other external partners.
Our faculty members represent some of our most important assets as a university. When we invest in our faculty, we are investing in our students and in the state of Illinois. The research and scholarship of these new faculty will contribute significantly to communities across our entire state and advance our reputation for innovation and impact.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
As you know, this week we have seen an increase in positive COVID-19 cases as we have repopulated the campus for the Fall 2022 semester. We are using on-campus COVID-19 testing capacity and data to track and monitor COVID-19 on our campus and in our community to adjust our approach as necessary. We are looking at the trend lines, clustering and risks with advice from university COVID-19 experts, and we are taking appropriate actions.
We expect to see another increase next week–especially as individuals travel over the Labor Day weekend and then return to campus. After each break, we have experienced these temporary spikes, and because of this we need your help to take COVID-19 precautions. We want to be sure you are informed so you can make the best decisions to maximize the safety and well-being of yourselves and others.
Face coverings are a safe and effective way to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 and free face coverings are available for those who need them at the Illini Union Bookstore. Of course, you know that we have and will continue to strongly recommend everyone wear a face covering at in-person classes during class time. Please consider also wearing them in other indoor locations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has given Champaign County a COVID-19 Community Level of “High,” indicating increased COVID-19 spread in our area. And the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) recently issued a strong recommendation for all community members to wear face coverings in all indoor spaces.
Testing is a critically important part of our multi-layered approach. We are continuing to offer on-campus testing at the Illini Union testing site, and we are working diligently to expand on-campus PCR testing for our faculty, staff and students and their families to provide increased protection. We have also distributed 10,000 antigen tests at locations across campus, and we have ordered 10,000 more to begin distributing next week. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms or are exposed to COVID-19, please take a test to protect yourself and others.
This is a very difficult time in the pandemic. I understand that we are all very weary of COVID-19 disrupting our university, our community and our lives, and we desperately want to return to our normal routines. Please be vigilant in protecting yourselves and others so that we can all enjoy a wonderful semester together. I am not asking you to not travel to see your families or to socialize, but please consider the risks and how you can protect yourself. I hope you have an enjoyable weekend, and thank you for once again stepping up to take care of one another.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Students and Employees,
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug Free Workplace Act and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act require the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:
http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/
The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.
Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, cannabis (marijuana) is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of cannabis on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to cannabis in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s cannabis prohibition.
The university’s cannabis prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical cannabis registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess cannabis on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.
The university’s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.
Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. University employees should contact Illinois Human Resources at (217) 333-2137.

The dental plan carrier will change in the 2022-2023 academic year from Delta Dental to UnitedHealthcare StudentResources.
The Urbana campus will now offer two student dental plans.
One dental plan automatically covers Graduate Assistants and Fellows with waiver-generating appointments beginning in the fall term. Such students may elect to voluntarily enroll dependents by going to the Student Insurance website starting today through October 4, 2022 and coverage will be effective on August 20. Students with waiver-generating appointments after October 4 can be enrolled in the dental plan as of the date their appointment is processed in accordance with the plan’s qualifying life event provisions.
A separate, voluntary plan for undergraduate and graduate students is being introduced for such students to directly purchase (and enroll dependents) with UnitedHealthcare at: uhcsr.com from August 20 through October 4, 2022, with coverage effective on August 20, 2022.
Vision Plan
The EyeMed Fidelity Security Life vision plan will continue to be provided to Graduate Assistants and Fellows with waiver-generating appointments. Coverage for dependents may be purchased by going to the Student Insurance website.  
New this academic year for undergraduates and graduate students is the option to voluntarily purchase vision benefits for themselves and their dependents. Coverage is purchased on the Student Insurance website.
Enrollment for the vision plan is available now until October 4, 2022, with an effective date of coverage of September 1, 2022.
Fees for the medical, dental, and vision plans for undergraduate and graduate students without waiver-generating appointments are located on the Student Insurance website at: si.illinois.edu/fees.  Graduate Assistants and Fellows with waiver-generating appointments may find the dental fees at grad.illinois.edu/current/dental and the vision fees at grad.illinois.edu/current/vision.

                August 30, 2022 10:11 AM
			
        
Dear Campus Community,


The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) has been designated a First-gen Forward institution by the Center for First-generation Student Success, an initiative of NASPA (Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education) and The Suder Foundation.


UIUC is one of 53 institutions named to the First-gen Forward 2022-23 cohort, the nation’s first recognition program acknowledging higher education institutions for their commitment to first-generation student success. There are currently 268 designated First-gen Forward Institutions across three #FirstgenForward cohorts. Collectively, they represent a community of professionals prepared to share evidence-based practices and resources, troubleshoot challenges, generate knowledge, and continue to advance the success of first-generation students across the United States.


“The Office of Minority Student Affairs (OMSA) is thrilled to be recognized for its ongoing efforts to expand educational equity among our diverse population of first-generation students. My colleagues and I are excited to join this outstanding community of higher education professionals. We look forward to sharing best practices, networking, and learning about new, evidence-based strategies that we can deploy to increase success for all U of I students.,” remarked Domonic Cobb, assistant vice chancellor for Student Success, Inclusion & Belonging and former director of the Office of Minority Student Affairs (OMSA). 


As one of the oldest and most comprehensive support programs in the nation, the OMSA was established in 1968 to provide advocacy and academic support services for domestic, minority students. With OMSA's guidance, a wide array of students who identify as first-generation, low-income, and/or historically underrepresented receive exceptional support services that enhance their academic achievement, personal development, and graduation rates. 


Diversity is one of the great strengths of a world-renowned academic institution such as the University of Illinois, and that presents both advantages and challenges for students. The OMSA works to create and sustain strong support networks for students by partnering with academic deans and advisors in the colleges and departments on campus to offer valuable academic support services and educational events for students. These efforts are extremely beneficial to students who may be the first in their family to attend college. 


The OMSA embodies the notion of Excellence at Illinois – both in the support services they provide and through the community of students who call the OMSA home. It is the vision of the OMSA to transform the lives for first-generation, low-income, and historically underrepresented students. The OMSA does this using six primary initiatives: tutoring and academic services, advising and mentoring, the TRIO Student Support Services Program, the TRIO Ronald E. McNair Post-Baccalaureate Achievement Program (McNair Scholars), the TRIO Talent Search Program, and the TRIO Upward Bound Program. Via these efforts first-year and continuing students are engaged through academic mentoring and coaching; assistance with course selection; tutoring, supplemental instruction, and academic services; graduate school preparation; financial aid and economic literacy workshops; individualized guidance with personal concerns; major and career exploration; academic advocacy and student support referral services, and scholastic events that build community and connect them with resources that increase their colligate success.


“The diversity of the community is a strength of the University of Illinois—they are succeeding on their mission as a land-grant university when first-generation students choose to join Illinois for their educational experiences,” said immediate past Provost Andreas C. Cangellaris. “The comprehensiveness and richness of the Illinois academic resources and programming, inspired by the commitment of the faculty and staff to the value of education, are integral to maximizing opportunities for every student to succeed.”


The OMSA is not the only avenue of support offered to first-generation students. As part of ongoing efforts to ensure the university is providing world-class student experiences, Illinois launched an effort called the Student Success Initiative. The university-wide initiative aims to better understand the factors that lead to undergraduate student success (including first-generation undergraduates), which include retention, graduation rates, placement, degree-completion time, and other outcomes and experiences. The initiative identifies strengths, gaps, and priorities with a focus on academic support, co-curricular activities, first-year experience, and foundational courses. The work helps the university decide what actions should be taken to ensure we are giving our students every opportunity to succeed.


Another program supporting first-generation and underrepresented students is the Fostering, Opportunity, Community, and Unwavering Support (FOCUS) Initiative.  Focus is a collaborative partnership between The Career Center and OMSA. In this program, students participate in an intensive yearlong program created to aid in eliminating the gap in post-graduation outcomes and starting salaries between underrepresented, first-generation students and their peers to positively impact their career trajectory, earnings potential, and economic security for years to come. Students who are selected as participants for the program receive a $2,500 scholarship to mitigate the financial burden of participation over two semesters.


“This designation demonstrates Illinois’ unmatched commitment to the success and support of first-generation students,” said Chancellor Robert J. Jones. “We are extremely proud to be a university that delivers on our land-grant missions while providing truly transformational learning experiences to students no matter where they come from.”


As members of a First-gen Forward institution, faculty and staff will have multiple opportunities to engage with peer institutions who are also creating environments that improve the experiences and outcomes of first-generation students. Selected institutions will send representatives to the First-gen Forward Workshop and will participate in monthly phone calls, virtual professional development, goal setting, blog development, annual reporting, and more. After two successful years in the program, institutions are eligible to apply for the center’s Advisory leadership designation.

                August 29, 2022 10:02 AM
			
        Starting September 28, 2022, multi-factor authentication (MFA) will be required for undergraduate students when accessing Microsoft Office 365 applications, including email. Prepare for this change by enrolling in Duo 2FA and registering your device. 
What is multi-factor authentication?
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is an electronic authentication method in which a user is granted access to a website or application only after successfully offering two pieces of evidence (factors): knowledge (something only the user knows) and possession (something only the user has). For your University account, your NetID and password are what you know, and a device enrolled in the Duo service is what you have. 
Why is it important?
Bad actors have unfortunately been targeting UIUC students with troubling frequency lately. This change will help you and our great university minimize the disruptions and phishing attacks we see so often these days. It can help protect both your personal data and University data from being accessed and used by unauthorized parties who may have discovered or stolen a password.
I do not currently have the Duo Security for MFA application or use multi-factor authentication for any University applications. What do I need to do?
Enroll your account in Duo by clicking the Set up 2FA button in the NetID Center, or by clicking the next button in the ""Welcome to Duo Security"" prompt screen. 
Follow the on-screen prompts to add a smartphone, traditional cell phone, or other device to use as your “second factor” while signing in. 
Install and set up the Duo Mobile app to make use of push notifications rather than phone calls or text messages for an easier and quicker login experience. How to Set Up 2FAHow to manage your devices
I already use the Duo Security for MFA application. What do I need to do?
If you see a Duo screen and are able to authenticate when logging in to protected University applications such as financial aid or payroll, you do not need to take any action. You will begin to see a new screen prompt before you can access Microsoft Office 365 applications and it will work similarly. 
Questions?

        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
While repopulating campus for the Fall 2022 semester, we have seen an increase in COVID-19 cases and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has given Champaign County a COVID-19 Community Level of “High,” indicating increased COVID-19 spread in our area. Out of concern for our entire community, the university is strongly recommending that everyone wears a high-quality face covering in classrooms during in-person class time beginning tomorrow, Monday, Aug. 29 through the next several weeks. Based on case data and trends, this time period is critical as we expect our on-campus cases to peak.
Details on Face Covering Guidance
Units and individuals can and should share that face coverings are strongly recommended based on increased cases and CDC guidance. However, face coverings are not required.
Course modality is not to be changed as a result of this new face covering guidance. For more information on course modality, please see this email from the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs.
If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms (fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea), please stay home. We are asking supervisors and instructors to show compassion to students and employees who are not feeling well.
Some individuals are not medically able to wear a face covering. Please be understanding and empathetic.
For more information on face coverings, please see the face covering page on the university's COVID-19 website.
We are sincerely grateful that due to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines and a university community that is more than 92 percent fully vaccinated, the positive cases this semester have generally been very mild or asymptomatic. We also expect to see new COVID-19 boosters be distributed as early as September, and we plan to make those available for our faculty, staff and students to provide increased protection.
I am continually amazed by our community’s commitment to maximizing our COVID-19 safety and our commitment to caring for one another. Thank you for wearing a face covering for the next several weeks.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                August 25, 2022 1:02 PM
			
        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
As we begin a new academic year, I write to share with you information about the offices, policies and resources available on our campus to help prevent and respond to sexual harassment and misconduct. The University of Illinois believes that each member of our university community should expect to learn and work in a community that prioritizes care, dignity and mutual respect. This expectation includes our responsibility to create a campus community that is free of harassment and discrimination based on sex, including gender discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and sexual violence. University policy prohibits discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation and gender identity, consistent with the Department of Education’s interpretation of discrimination based on sex.
Danielle Fleenor, our university’s Title IX Coordinator, provides oversight and support for the university’s comprehensive Title IX programs and initiatives. Dr. Fleenor can be reached at titleixcoordinator@illinois.edu or (844) 616-7978. You may also visit the Title IX Office for more information about ways the office can assist.
A full description of the Sexual Misconduct policy, process and information about reporting obligations, as well as the provision of confidential advisors under Title IX, is maintained centrally on the We Care: Sexual Misconduct Support, Response, and Prevention website. All students, faculty and staff are asked to review the University of Illinois System Statement on Sex Discrimination, Sexual Harassment and Other Sexual Misconduct, which is also located on the We Care site. The Sexual Misconduct Policy in the Campus Administrative Manual and Student Code includes other prohibited sexual misconduct in addition to Title IX Sexual Harassment.
If you experience sexual misconduct – including sexual harassment, sexual assault, and other forms of sexual violence – know that you are not alone and support is available. On our campus, there are several confidential resources, including the Counseling Center, McKinley Health Center and the Women’s Resources Center (WRC). The WRC has Confidential Advisors, who are staff members specifically trained to provide support and advocacy. The We Care site has additional information about campus resources and answers to frequently asked questions about reporting options.
Sexual misconduct in any form violates our institutional values. It is the responsibility of each one of us to stand up against harmful behavior in our community. I encourage you to take a few moments to learn more about these campus resources, so that together we can continue to create a university that supports and values the success and well-being of all.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
I’m writing to provide some additional details for COVID-19 testing and logistics during the Fall 2022 semester. If you have not already read this massmail about Fall 2022 COVID-19 guidelines, I encourage you to do so. It provides more detail about the University of Illinois System’s vaccine and testing requirements, as well as our university’s approach to face coverings for the semester.
COVID-19 testing for those who are not fully vaccinated
In order to remain compliant with the University of Illinois System’s COVID-19 vaccine requirement, if you are not fully vaccinated, you must receive an on-campus test result once per week.
Starting Monday, Aug. 15, the Illini Union testing location hours will be 7:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. on weekdays with expanded capacity during those hours. It will be the only testing site.
Please arrive early and expect results to take up to 48 hours to process.
Please note that except for employees who work at off-campus university facilities (e.g., Extension staff), off-campus/take-home testing options do not fulfill the on-campus testing requirement.
COVID-19 testing for those who are fully vaccinated 
We anticipate a rush at the beginning of the semester. We have testing requirements for the unvaccinated, and we want to make sure that we are able to meet this demand in a timely way. Therefore, we are asking vaccinated people to avoid the on-campus testing sites for a few weeks. We are making alternative tests available.
Starting next week, the university will have a supply of take-home antigen tests available on campus for those who want a test. We are providing these fast, reliable tests as a convenience for everyone. Faculty, staff and students will be required to show their i-card and can pick up one test per day at the following locations while supplies last:
PAR front desk
Ikenberry Commons front desk
ISR front desk
Orchard Downs office
ARC
Illini Union Bookstore
Illini Union Quad Shop

We are also currently pursuing additional testing options for those who are fully vaccinated.
We will not turn away fully vaccinated people from the testing site, but we are strongly asking you to choose alternative testing options to help us maximize testing capacity and efficiency for the beginning of the semester.
Illinois App & COVID-19 Boarding Pass 
Building Access Status is no longer available in the Illinois App or the COVID-19 Boarding Pass. The university is monitoring COVID-19 vaccine and testing compliance through digital mechanisms. All individuals required to test are monitored and those not meeting the requirements are subject to student or employee discipline.
The Illinois App still includes some COVID-19 information, including wellness resources. For more information about the Illinois App, visit their website.
If you have questions, please email covid-19@illinois.edu. I thank you for your patience and understanding as we prepare for the beginning of the Fall 2022 semester. Each phase of the COVID-19 pandemic has required our university to navigate challenges and be ready to pivot, and this phase is no different. I have confidence in our approach for this academic year, and I have even more confidence in our community’s ability to care for one another.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                August 8, 2022 1:17 PM
			
        Dear Colleagues,
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is committed to maintaining an inclusive educational environment for students of all religious backgrounds, and to upholding Illinois law requiring the University to reasonably accommodate its students’ religious beliefs, observances, and practices concerning admissions, class attendance, and the scheduling of examinations and work requirements. Whenever possible, it is best practice to plan exams, required labs, and other due dates around religious holidays. The Religious Observances that Affect the Academic Calendar webpage is an excellent resource to bookmark for reference to find listings of the primary sacred times for many world religions that may affect your course and event planning.
When planning around such dates is impossible, instructors need to provide accommodations for students who have a religious observance as outlined in the Student Code, Article 1, Part 5 – Class Attendance and Article 1, Section 1-107 on Religious Beliefs, Observances, and Practices. Notable for unit executive officers, Section 1-107 b. allows appeals to the dean of the academic unit offering the course when a religious accommodation is not granted or a student believes that the accommodation is unreasonable. Accordingly, units should have a process for the dean to hear such appeals or designate a committee, such as the executive committee or other body, that will hear the appeals and make a recommendation to the dean. Appeals should be rare, as instructors are expected to offer reasonable accommodations as required under Illinois law.
Information for Faculty on Accommodating Religious Observances contains helpful tips for application and best practices. Instructors who have questions may contact Stephen Bryan, Dean of Students, at 217-333-0050 or via email at deanofstudents@illinois.edu.
Thank you for your time and consideration of this important matter.

                August 2, 2022 10:50 AM
			
        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
As we are all making the final preparations for the opening of the fall semester, I also ask that we all take a moment to recommit ourselves to our collective responsibility to create a community at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign where people of all faiths, races, gender identities, ethnicities, national origins and viewpoints can live, learn and thrive.
Inclusivity, tolerance and respect are core values for our institution, but unfortunately, they are not always reflected in the lived experiences of all members of our community. For instance, the traditional celebrations of the end of the last academic year were shadowed by anti-Semitic messages dropped around the campus and by an individual’s irresponsible act of throwing a rock towards a rooftop deck where a group of Jewish students were gathered for a private event. No one was physically injured, and the quick and careful investigation by our University of Illinois Police Department identified the person responsible who is now facing criminal prosecution. Just last week, we received reports of swastikas and Nazi-associated phrases carved into a restroom stall in one of our facilities.
These anti-Semitic acts and expressions are antithetical to our university values. Anti-Semitism has no place here at Illinois. And we are all diminished by expressions of intolerance and prejudice of any kind. Whether in the form of anti-Semitism, racism, sexism, Islamophobia, religious intolerance, gender bias or any of the too many other ways some in our society invent to marginalize or devalue others—this university will never tolerate hate, discrimination or violence. 
I know the coming year will bring differences of opinion, strenuous debate and intense disagreement across a spectrum of issues. Academic freedom and freedom of expression remain our bedrock foundation. We will certainly see protests and other very public expressions of perspectives on some of the most difficult and divisive issues facing our community, nation and society. As a university we welcome those expressions, and we embrace this discourse. We are at our very best when we encourage everyone to give voice to their beliefs and to openly and safely be their authentic self.
I simply ask that we also commit ourselves to expressing ideas with respect, compassion and empathy and to cultivating a community that allows for a safe and robust exchange of viewpoints. And I remind everyone that hate, violence and discrimination will never be acceptable or tolerated here at Illinois.
I wish you all a restful and happy final few weeks of summer, and I look forward to our new year together.
Sincerely, Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                July 29, 2022 10:31 AM
			
        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
I write to announce that Executive Vice Provost Bill Bernhard has agreed to serve as interim vice chancellor for academic affairs and provost, pending approval by the Board of Trustees. He will serve in a designate capacity until that time. His appointment will begin on August 16. I plan to initiate a national search for our next permanent provost as soon as possible and hope to have that individual appointed in time to open the spring semester.
Since Provost Cangellaris’ announced his departure, I have been speaking with our deans, university leadership, the Senate Executive Committee and members of our faculty and staff about the qualifications and qualities they believe are necessary. Executive Vice Provost Bernhard brings all of those to this critical leadership role. He is a respected scholar, experienced teacher and a former department and college executive. That experience combined with his seven years of service in the Office of the Provost gives him a deep understanding of every aspect of our academic operations at Illinois that makes him the clear choice to serve as interim provost as we head into the new academic year.
Please join me in congratulating Executive Vice Provost Bernhard and thank you for your support in the coming months to ensure that our academic enterprise continues to grow and thrive during this transition.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                July 27, 2022 4:02 PM
			
        Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff:
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is tracking a 2022 U.S. Monkeypox virus (MPV) outbreak. Locally, the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) is closely monitoring reported cases in Champaign County.
Below is important information about MPV as well as recommended precautions to help ensure our campus community remains safe.
What is Monkeypox?
Rare disease caused by infection with the monkeypox virus (MPV)
Similar symptoms to smallpox, but more mild
Illness typically lasts 2-4 weeks
Rarely fatal
Symptoms:
Fever
Headache
Swollen lymph nodes
Muscle aches and/or backache
Chills
Exhaustion
A rash that can look like pimples or blisters that appears on the face, inside the mouth, and on other parts of the body
How is it Spread?
Direct contact with the infectious rash, scabs, or body fluids
Touching objects, fabrics, and surfaces that have been used by someone with monkeypox
Contact with respiratory secretions during prolonged face-to-face contact
Contact during intimate physical contact or touching the genitals of a person with monkeypox
Hugging, massage, and kissing
Pregnant women can spread the virus to their fetus through the placenta
Who is at Risk?
Anyone can get MPV
Persons with multiple, anonymous, and/or same sex partners may increase their chance of exposure to monkeypox
High-risk population: men who have sex with men
When to Seek Medical Care?
If you experience any of the following seek medical attention immediately:
Symptoms including fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes, muscle aches and/or backache, chills, exhaustion
New or unexplained sores or rash that can look like pimples or blisters that appears on the face, inside the mouth, and other parts of the body
Or, if you have been exposed to someone who presented with symptoms or was diagnosed with monkeypox
Treatment:
There are no specific monkeypox treatments, however, due to its similarities to smallpox, an antiviral drug may be prescribed
Students who have paid the Health Service Fee may seek care at McKinley Health Center for symptoms or exposure (an antiviral treatment or monkeypox vaccine may be provided (depending on availability))
Preventive Steps:
Avoid close, skin-to-skin contact with people who have a rash that looks like monkeypox
Do not touch the rash or scabs of a person with monkeypox
Do not kiss, hug, cuddle, or have sex with someone with monkeypox
Do not share eating utensils or cups with a person with monkeypox
Do not handle or touch the bedding, towels, or clothing of a person with monkeypox
Wash your hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer

                July 26, 2022 10:21 AM
			
        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
As we approach the beginning of the Fall 2022 semester, I am writing to share information about important COVID-19 requirements the university will have in place this semester. We have confidence in our approach, and we are excited to welcome our students and faculty back to campus for the start of the academic year.
COVID-19 Vaccines
As you may have read in this email from University of Illinois President Tim Killeen, the System is continuing to require all faculty, staff and students be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 (defined as 14 days after the final dose of the primary series) if they are able to do so, and our university will be following that directive.
If you have been vaccinated and you have not already submitted your vaccination card to the university (e.g., first-year students, new graduate students, transfer students, etc.), you are required to upload a photo of your Vaccination Record Card to the MyMcKinley Portal.
Individuals who are not able to receive the COVID-19 vaccine for medical or religious reasons and do not already have an exemption must request an exemption and submit any relevant documentation as soon as possible:
 Students who wish to request a medical exemption should submit through the MyMcKinley Portal.
Students who wish to request a religious exemption should fill out this form.
Faculty or staff who wish to request a religious or medical exemption should submit their request to the Office for Access and Equity by filling out this form.

COVID-19 Testing 
 Individuals who do not have a verified Vaccination Record Card on file will be required to test at an on-campus COVID-19 testing site once per week. Testing compliance will be monitored and those out of compliance may face student or employee discipline.
Individuals who are not fully vaccinated but have recently tested positive for COVID-19 will not be required to test for the 90-day period after the date of the positive test. If you have recently tested positive off-campus and are not fully vaccinated, you should upload your result by following these instructions:
Log into the MyMcKinley Portal.
Click on the “Upload” button on the right side of the menu header.
Choose “COVID-19 Outside Results/Notifications – Urbana-Champaign Campus Only” from the drop-down menu.
 Upload your positive COVID-19 test result file.

 We encourage anyone to test if they experience symptoms. All faculty, staff and students will continue to have access to on-campus testing, and we also encourage all members of our university community to consider ordering free at-home tests from the United States Postal Service and to contact their insurance provider about other available opportunities for free testing. Please note that except for employees who work at off-campus university facilities (e.g., Extension staff), these off-campus testing options do not fulfill the on-campus requirement for those who are not fully vaccinated.
Face Coverings
Face coverings will not be required in classrooms or any campus spaces except healthcare facilities (e.g., COVID-19 testing sites, McKinley Health Center, the Counseling Center, etc.). There are to be no additional expectations for face coverings for units, facilities or events.
Individuals are always welcome to wear a face covering to help protect themselves and others. We encourage everyone to assess their own personal risk level and make decisions about where and when they choose to wear a face covering.
Monitoring & Compliance
Building Access Status will no longer be active for the Fall 2022 semester in the Illinois app or the Boarding Pass. You should not ask anyone to prove their vaccination or testing status.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, the primary way the university has monitored COVID-19 vaccine and testing compliance is through digital mechanisms. All individuals required to test are monitored and those not meeting the requirements are subject to student or employee discipline.
We continue to take guidance from the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD), and we are actively monitoring COVID-19 on campus and in the local community. We will make modifications to our approach for the semester if necessary.
Thank you for all of the effort and sacrifices you have made so far to minimize the impact of COVID-19. I’m so grateful for your care for one another, and I am so proud of the COVID-19 ecosystem and community we have built here together at Illinois.

Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear students, faculty and staff:
As we prepare to return to our universities this fall, University of Illinois System leaders continue to think first and foremost about the safety of all of you and the surrounding communities amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Throughout the pandemic, measures we have taken to mitigate against the virus that causes COVID-19 have made our three universities among the safest places to be. These measures – particularly vaccination – remain our best protection.
In keeping with this approach, students, faculty and staff will be required to be vaccinated against the virus, and we strongly recommend that you get booster shots, as well. Those who are not vaccinated will need to test on their campuses once a week.
Decisions about masking and any other additional requirements will be made by each university based on local conditions and requirements in their communities. Look for further guidance from your university.
Through your efforts, the U of I System has set the highest possible standard for safety during the pandemic and served as a model for the nation. We have done this while continuing to offer world-class educational opportunities to more and more students and pursuing the kind of research and innovation that changes lives for the better.
We will, as we have throughout the pandemic, adapt as necessary should conditions change.
Thank you all for your continued diligence in the academic year ahead.

        Dear Faculty and Staff,
I am pleased to share that today Illinois Human Resources and our campus partners completed the two-year project to move to a new platform for posting vacancies and accepting applications. This has been a coordinated effort throughout the University of Illinois System as all universities and System Offices are implementing new platforms.   
We know that jobs.illinois.edu, our online employment site, serves as the “curb appeal” of inviting potential applicants to join the Illinois family and the site has undergone an exciting upgrade. Our new platform highlights the university and some of the great reasons to work here, has intuitive usability and is mobile friendly. This change brings more consistency to our hiring practices, as well as makes the application process shorter and easier to complete. As the university continues with Operational Excellence, this embodies the very principles established in this initiative. 
Employees access the posted job opportunities via a job board made exclusively for employees by utilizing your NetID and password. No new login and password to remember! This employee only job board features all job opportunities posted to our career site for applicants external to the University, as well as any job opportunities intended only for current employees. The new job board will continue to post more jobs as the week goes on.
If you have not already done so, you can elect to receive email notifications of new posted opportunities, simply click on the “Sign Up for Job Alerts” on the site. This is a great way to stay informed of career opportunities here at Illinois. 
If you have any questions about the site, please contact us at jobs@illinois.edu.
Sincerely,
Shari Mickey- BoggsSenior Associate Chancellor for Human Resources"

        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
I am pleased to announce the university is partnering with local businesses and organizations to invest $300,000 to fight violent crime in Champaign County.
The funds, named Investment for Impact, will be allocated to the United Way of Champaign County to address immediate solutions to violent crime, as well as long-term solutions to address underlying factors and patterns that lead to future violent behavior. We are joined by Busey Bank, Carle Health, Christie Clinic, OSF HealthCare and the United Way of Champaign County, each of which is investing $50,000. Read more about this commitment here.
In the past few years, our community has seen a rise in violent crime, especially among youth and young adults. Our county is not alone in this issue: National data show an increase in violent crime across communities in the United States. And while the rise in community violence is national, solutions must be local.
Through a variety of programs and services, we will give children – especially those from under-resourced neighborhoods or living in high-poverty conditions – the help they need and deserve. Fostering social connectedness and belonging among youth in our community is an integral part of disrupting the cycle of violence. We will do this by supporting youth development programs and afterschool and summer programming that focuses on academics and attendance , as well as programming that builds social-emotional persistence and intelligence. We will work to stop violence and promote safety by emphasizing enforcement, street-based violence interruption, trauma and emotional supports, family engagement and wrap-around supports.
Investment for Impact further strengthens the university’s Call to Action to Address Racism and Social Injustice and builds on the work done by the Campus-Community Compact to Accelerate Social Justice, which works with the cities and community organizations to combat systemic racism in our community. There are six focus areas: accessible technology; community relations; economic development; health, wealth and resilience; inclusive education and workforce development.
Businesses and organizations and their leaders have a responsibility and an obligation to lift up and advance the communities in which they live and work. We are coming together to do our part by supporting with words, actions and financial support.
In addition to the organizational investment, individuals are also welcome to support this effort. Funds are managed and administered by United Way. Learn more at their Victory over Violence webpage.
Investment for Impact is our commitment to invest in these efforts to continue to change our community for the better. Together, we can make a difference.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Colleagues,
I am pleased to share that Chrystalla Mouza has been selected to serve as the next Dean of the College of Education. Mouza’s appointment will begin August 15, pending approval by the University of Illinois Board of Trustees. Her title until officially approved will be Dean of the College of Education Designate.
Mouza is currently the Director & Distinguished Professor in the School of Education and a Professor of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Delaware. An accomplished scholar, researcher and innovator in educational technology, Mouza’s work has focused in the areas of learning sciences and teacher learning, applications of technology in K-12 classrooms, teaching and learning outcomes in ubiquitous and mobile computing environments and computer science education. Her expertise in forging interdisciplinary collaborations will help the College of Education enhance existing areas of excellence and expand partnerships and growth opportunities.
Mouza has received multiple awards, including the 2010 Distinguished Research in Teacher Education Award from the Association of Teacher Educators. A first-generation college graduate, she received her bachelor of arts in elementary education from the University of Ioannina, Greece and earned master of arts, master of education and doctor of education degrees in instructional technology and media from Teachers College, Columbia University.
Mouza has a clear vision for advancing our College of Education, a strong record of success in her past leadership roles, an enthusiasm about the opportunity to bolster the College’s excellence in teaching and engagement and a proven record of research.
I want to thank James Anderson for serving as the Dean of the College of Education for the past five years. Anderson is a celebrated Illinois leader, faculty member and researcher, and I wish him well on his retirement. I also want to thank Professor Michaelene Ostrosky for serving as Interim Dean until Mouza begins her appointment.
Please join me in welcoming Chrystalla Mouza to campus.

                June 22, 2022 1:31 PM
			
        Dear Colleagues,
I think you all would agree that over recent years, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has amassed numerous human health-related academic assets that are requisite to our long-term strategic goals in health and health innovation. I am delighted to announce that I have charged a Health Innovation Visioning Committee to assess the university’s health-related assets across our colleges and institutes. This team will propose the future role of Illinois as a pioneer in establishing a new technology-driven academic health research and education model that makes a significant, visible, and sustained impact on human health.
Our university is renowned for disciplinary excellence at scale, across many fields in research and education, as well as our demonstrated ability to bring together diverse teams to solve complicated problems. The COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most complex health problems in our lifetime, underscores the importance of personal, public and global health. Our university’s response to the pandemic through the SHIELD program exemplifies the impact that we can have through health innovation and education. Our research community and our academic units have made significant contributions to human health, and our recent high-impact successes build on investments in unique infrastructure and new assets. Yet, perplexing health-related challenges persist. Illinois can meet those challenges by leveraging the strength of our hallmark interdisciplinary approaches to research and education and harnessing the spirit of innovation that spans the entirety of campus.
I have asked the members of this committee to think broadly and boldly about how technology-inspired health, transformative education and social innovation can uniquely position Illinois as a national and global leader in health innovation to generate many more examples like SHIELD that improve the human condition and impact humanity.
Specifically, I have charged the committee to address the following opportunities and questions:
Inventory the University’s assets and strengths across colleges and institutes that can be capitalized upon for innovation to advance health and human welfare. These should span physical, mental, emotional and community health.
Propose and define key interdisciplinary themes across the University’s comprehensive research enterprise that position Illinois to pioneer breakthrough, transformative research and innovation for technology-inspired health and wellness, as well as profound social advances.
Likewise, propose changes to existing and/or envision new educational and training models and infrastructure that could support the development of bold new approaches to academic health that advance health innovation and its impact throughout our nation and the world.
Identify investments in infrastructure, equipment, faculty and research personnel that are critical to capitalize on previous and proposed investments to advance the impact of health innovation.
Identify key stakeholders – whether current or aspirational – that can be utilized in strategic partnerships to grow our portfolio in health innovation and technology and expand its impact.
Review program statements for the Research Park-based Graduation Facility (including EnterpriseWorks) and the University Avenue-based Translational Research Facility and propose a strategic plan to integrate the campus mission to advance health innovation and translation.
I am encouraging them to think comprehensively, including not only direct allied health professions and medicine, but more broadly mental and physical health, public and rural health, agricultural technologies that improve the production, nutrition and safety of our food resources, environmental health for the betterment and protection of our planet and global health, for sustaining the life, health and wellness in all communities, societies and populations around the world.
The plan that emerges from their work to develop Illinois as an epicenter for health innovation should complement and support our investments and strategic goals for the Carle Illinois College of Medicine, Cancer Center at Illinois, College of Applied Health Sciences, Interdisciplinary Health Sciences Institute, Carle-Illinois Strategic Affiliation Steering Committee, Mayo Clinic and Illinois Alliance, JUMP-ARCHES, Beckman Institute, Center for Social and Behavioral Sciences and the many other key units on campus related to health.
I have asked Professor Stephen Boppart, a tireless advocate for envisioning and developing technology to improve human health, to serve as chair of this Visioning Committee. Professor Boppart will also become Interim Director of IHSI on August 16, 2022, when Professor Neal Cohen steps down as Director and begins a well-deserved sabbatical.
The work of the Health Innovation Visioning Committee will be vital to the next steps of investment and impact in our strategic planning for our health innovation ecosystem here at Illinois, and I ask that when the Committee reaches out for campus participation in the discussion that you offer your valuable input.
This effort will succeed only with the expertise and commitment of our entire campus community. I want to thank, in advance, the committee members and everyone who provides thoughtful input as we envision a cohesive, coordinated plan to bring about transformative change and impact for the state, nation and world.  
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

It is with conflicting emotions today that I tell you that Andreas Cangellaris, Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost since 2018, has told me he will be leaving that role in August to become the Founding President of NEOM University. Selfishly, I am sorry that our university will lose such a dynamic, innovative and empathetic scholar, teacher and leader. But it is hard to feel anything but excited for Provost Cangellaris about this chance to shape the future of the first university in this new sustainable regional development in Saudi Arabia.  
In the coming weeks, I will name an Interim Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost. We will launch an international search later this summer, and I am optimistic we will have the next permanent provost in place by the start of the spring semester.
Provost Cangellaris has been a member of this university and this community for more than 25 years, and I challenge you to find an individual who better exemplifies the spirit of the land-grant university mission. He is a renowned researcher. He is a relentless advocate for students, staff and faculty alike. He is a trusted steward of our financial resources and the guardian of our academic integrity and excellence. He is a collaborative, creative and purposeful administrator. And at every step of his career at Illinois, he has quietly shown us that kindness, compassion and empathy do not detract from strong and strategic leadership – but in fact are the very qualities that define the leaders we admire most.
To adequately share his list of notable accomplishments at Illinois would require a series of massmails. But I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge Provost Cangellaris’ extraordinary contributions to the health, safety and future of our university throughout the COVID-19 crisis. I have regularly stated my belief that no other university navigated the pandemic with a stronger commitment to the safety and well-being of students, faculty, staff and community members than ours. While Provost Cangellaris would be the last to take any credit for that record, he is most certainly the first to whom it should be given.
When you set out to build a new kind of university, literally from the ground up, you will need a leader who has unfailingly demonstrated by word and by action his belief that education is the most powerful, transformational and equalizing force on the planet. More critically, you need an individual who inspires those who choose to join that university to believe that creating a better world isn’t just possible – it is a personal and sacred responsibility.
So, it should be no surprise to anyone here at Illinois that NEOM’s search for its inaugural leader led them directly to our provost – to my colleague and friend – Andreas Cangellaris.
We will all deeply miss Provost Cangellaris’ counsel, wisdom, leadership, endless patience and inexhaustible good humor. But I hope each of us also shares a sense of joy and excitement for Provost Cangellaris at this singular opportunity to build and lead a new global university.
And, on behalf of all of the students, faculty, staff and leadership of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I want to thank him for his long, distinguished service here. We are a stronger, better and kinder university thanks to Andreas.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                June 14, 2022 2:17 PM
			
        In April, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) announced that projected electric capacity shortfalls in the organization’s north and central regions this summer might leave those areas at increased risk of temporary, controlled outages. While Abbott Power Plant generates approximately half of the campus’ electricity through an efficient cogeneration process, the university typically acquires the rest from Ameren as a market participant in MISO.
Because of the possibility of planned blackouts or brownouts occurring on the regional electrical grid that supplies the campus, Facilities & Services (F&S) is updating operational strategies designed to meet the university’s energy needs should those situations arise. These methods will include the following:
Implementing new, aggressive energy conservation procedures at the facility level
Increasing on-site energy production capacity at Abbott Power Plant
Maximizing use of the campus Thermal Energy Storage tank and load-shifting processes
Incorporating renewables when consistent output exists
Optimizing building digital controls systems
Performing urgent contingency planning as necessary
As part of this comprehensive effort, F&S staff will coordinate with representatives from colleges, departments, units, and institutes to identify specific building solutions and discuss utilities production and distribution service adjustments that strive to drastically reduce energy demand during projected peak periods and help maintain campus energy reliability. Taking further steps to conserve energy will be especially important with warmer-than-typical temperatures forecasted for the Midwest over the next several months, beginning with heat warnings this week. MISO has also indicated longer-term concerns about potential recurring capacity shortfalls of this variety.
Providing safe, reliable, and environmentally responsible energy service without interruption is critical to supporting teaching and research activities and protecting the well-being of all individuals on campus. The university will continue proactively shaping its energy future through your support while adapting to these transmission challenges and market conditions.
For more information or questions about ongoing preparations, contact Director of Utilities & Energy Services Rob Roman roman@illinois.edu, 217-300-5810.

        Dear Faculty and Staff,
I am pleased to share that Dr. Ingrid S. Fulmer has been selected to serve as the new dean of the School of Labor and Employment Relations. Dean Designate Fulmer’s appointment will begin July 1, pending approval by the University of Illinois Board of Trustees. 
Dr. Fulmer is the Vice Provost for Faculty Advancement and Faculty Affairs at Rutgers University-New Brunswick and professor in human resource management at the School of Management and Labor Relations. She earned a Ph.D. in management and organization studies from Vanderbilt University. She has expertise in human resource management, organizational behavior and business ethics.
Dr. Fulmer previously served as the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and as Director of the Ph.D. program in the School of Management and Labor Relations at Rutgers. She also serves on the Board of Governors of the Academy of Management and as International Co-chairperson of the European Institute of Advanced Studies in Management (EIASM) annual workshop on Strategic Human Resource Management. Previously, she served in the elected five-year leadership track and as an elected representative-at-large of the HR Division of the Academy of Management. She has also been the director of the Centre for Workplace Excellence at the University of South Australia Business School. A former associate editor of Academy of Management Review and of the International Journal of Human Resource Management, she is currently on the editorial boards of several academic journals. In her “first career,” prior to completing her Ph.D. at Vanderbilt University and entering academia, she worked as a CPA and consultant.
Her research and teaching are in the areas of human resource management and organizational behavior. Current research interests include compensation system design, pay communication and transparency, valuation of organizational human capital, and management of former (i.e., alumni) employees. She also studies social interactions among people and groups in organizations. Her research has been published in Academy of Management Review, Academy of Management Journal, Journal of Applied Psychology, Personnel Psychology, Journal of Management, Business Ethics Quarterly and Journal of Business Ethics, as well as in other journals and edited volumes.
I want to thank Dean Drasgow for his calm and patient leadership of the School. During his tenure, LER completed a $6 million addition and renovation, the first change to the footprint of the building since 1962. The online master’s program grew, providing the School with a vital new revenue stream. Numerous scholarships and named professorships were completed, including the Derber, Wagner and Soderstrom professorships, enabling the School to attract and retain top faculty and students. The School also met and surpassed its With Illinois campaign goals. I am confident Dr. Fulmer will lead the School to continue to build on those accomplishments.
Please join me in congratulating Dr. Fulmer and thank you in advance for welcoming her when she arrives on campus this summer.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

                May 25, 2022 11:01 AM
			
        Dear Colleagues,
At the start of the Operational Excellence @ Illinois initiative in May 2021, we set out to answer a critical question: How will we maximize our missions through operational excellence and steward resources to achieve our vision of institutional preeminence? In January 2022, we updated you that we were moving forward with organizational redesign in five administrative categories (budget & procurement, information technology & data, human resources, physical space, marketing & communications) and hiring Huron Consulting Group to collaborate with us on this effort. Thanks to the energy and dedication of our task force, executive sponsors and work teams, we have identified a path to move forward with specific suggestions and recommendations.
After combining the work team recommendations with interview, focus group, survey and benchmarking data, the university has identified human resources and information technology support as the two most critical areas of need. Huron Consulting Group will be engaging these two areas with specific design teams to plan and better define services, roles and responsibilities for a new operating model. With HR and IT efforts as a model, design team formation and operating model design efforts for remaining functions will move forward in a phased approach throughout 2022 and into 2023.
To ensure sufficient investment to and success for all functions, we are dedicating resources to formalize the Operational Excellence Office, which will include a project management team dedicated to the initiative. The establishment of this office and dedicated team, which will report to Mike DeLorenzo in his role as Vice Chancellor for Administration and Operations, is a crucial first step in committing sustained resources to support Operational Excellence @ Illinois immediately and other strategic initiatives in the future.
With this structure in place, tactical opportunities identified by all Operational Excellence @ Illinois work teams as quick wins or already underway will move forward. Corresponding investment decisions will be made by a shared governance process with the support of the new project management team. In the coming months, we will be sharing more specifics about this process.
I am incredibly excited and energized by the beneficial impact of this initiative. Our response to the COVID-19 pandemic has clearly proven that we have extraordinary capability to collaborate and innovate. It is my sincere hope that this initiative helps us rethink business as usual to maximize our missions and excellence.
Sincerely,Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Students and Employees,
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug Free Workplace Act and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act require the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:
http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/
The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.
Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to marijuana in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s marijuana prohibition.
The university’s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.
The university’s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.
Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. University employees should contact Illinois Human Resources at (217) 333-2137.

                May 6, 2022 3:02 PM
			
        Hello from the Student Sustainability Committee (SSC)! 
If you have original project ideas to improve campus sustainability – or you want to help others make their sustainability projects a reality – then the SSC is for you. Please read on to learn about our history, funding, recent accomplishments, and how you can get involved!
What is the SSC?
We are a student-led organization that provides financial support to projects led by campus community members that promote environmental stewardship and student engagement on campus. These funds come from the Illinois Green Fund, which is composed of two student-initiated fees: the Sustainable Campus Environment Fee ($12.06/student per semester) and the Cleaner Energy Technologies Fee ($2/student per semester). 
The committee was formed in 2002 by a group of passionate students fighting for the use of clean energy on campus. Today, we have expanded our scope from ongoing decarbonization efforts to include all facets of sustainability. SSC now consists of 18 enthusiastic student-voting members as well as many staff and faculty members who provide their expertise; together, we are an interdisciplinary team that is well equipped to determine which projects will best serve our campus community. Past projects have helped fund Eco-Illini, Solar Decathlon, Red Oak Rain Garden, Bevier Cafe's herb garden, the Illini Union’s recycling bins, CIF’s geothermal system, and many more! Each of these projects falls under one of the SSC’s Working Groups: Energy, Transportation & Infrastructure, Education & Justice, Food & Waste, Energy, and Land, Water, & Air.
Over the past 20 years, the SSC has proudly dedicated $15.55 million to 316 individual projects, which have significantly improved campus sustainability and engagement.
Recent Accomplishments
Because the SSC receives funding from students to be used for students, it’s important to share our achievements with those who make the SSC possible: you! 
Over the last two years, the SSC brought to life its longstanding goal of having a greater focus on student interaction and engagement. We added six new voting positions and restructured the committee to include entirely new branches dedicated to outreach in the form of our communications and social initiatives teams. We also officially began recruiting general members to encourage more students to have a voice in evaluating sustainability project applications.
Through our increased outreach efforts, we have reached more campus environmental groups than ever. In October 2021, we co-hosted a month-long Student Sustainability Summit that included Green Quad Day, the Tuesday Talks at Bevier Cafe seminar series, a movie night, tours of university facilities, teach-ins, and a climate strike. We also programmed many Earth Month activities throughout April, hosting another Green Quad Day, more Tuesday Talks, and a showing of The Lorax at the Illini Union.
Some other initiatives that we had the privilege of working with and funding this year include: 
The first-ever Sustainability Grammys to recognize all the amazing work that environmental RSOs do on campus, co-hosted by iSEE’s Greener Campus Office
The development of a single-use plastic reuse and elimination protocol at the Brinkworth Lab
The Sustainable Lab Network, which will compile a database of sustainability education resources
Fume hood upgrades in Morrill Hall to decrease energy demand
The Sustainability Mural Project to highlight the university's sustainability initiatives
A collection of proposed, completed, and ongoing SSC projects can be found on the iCAP Portal.
The SSC is also excited to announce our role as an organizer of the Reimagine Our Future Undergraduate Sustainability Competition that will take place in fall 2022. This competition challenges students to work independently or in interdisciplinary teams to research and solve a problem related to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. For the first time, the competition will have an international scope. Students will have the exciting opportunity to form teams with students from other participating universities around the world, and, for the time commitment of a 1-credit hour course, your team could win up to $2,000. The competition application will open this summer; visit the competition website often and subscribe to the SSC mailing list to stay updated! 
How to Get Involved
Have a project idea that will improve campus sustainability and/or student engagement? Submit an application for funding! Even if you just have an idea but aren’t sure how to make it into a project yet, our working group chairs can help you develop your idea. Student-led projects under $10K are accepted on a rolling basis, while all other projects are accepted on a semesterly schedule. 
Interested in reviewing project applications and voting on how to allocate grant funding? Apply to be a board member – the deadline is Wednesday, May 11! The time commitment to be a board member is approximately three hours a week.
Want to join the SSC community in a lower commitment level role? Become a general member! You can attend social events and biweekly working group meetings (where we meet with applicants and discuss proposed projects), all of which can be found on our calendar. General members are welcome to attend any number of meetings – just one or all! 
Subscribe to our mailing list or follow us on Instagram @ssc_uiuc to stay up-to-date on everything that’s going on with the SSC!

        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
As part of our ongoing efforts to ensure the university is providing world-class education and facilitating a sense of belonging, the Student Success Initiative has continued work to better understand the factors that lead to undergraduate student success and better student experiences. We are excited to share with you some key updates on the SSI’s work this year and plans for the future.
The Inaugural Student Success Initiative Symposium engaged over 200 faculty, staff, and students in February, 2022 in thinking critically about undergraduate success, ways to bolster retention and graduation rates, close equity gaps, and enhance the Illinois experience.
Building on the discussion at the Symposium, the SSI has made strides in key areas impacting the student experience:
Student Mental Health
United with the Mental Health Working Group to implement a comprehensive wellness website, e-tools, pilot a Faculty and Staff Mental Health Ambassador Program, and a Mental Health statement for syllabi.
Contributed to a system-wide Mental Health Symposium and received a $5,000 grant to create Wellness Spaces on campus.
Student Learning Experience
Working toward a more streamlined Learning Management System (LMS) experience for students, helped faculty migrate materials to Canvas, the campus-supported LMS.
Responding to COVID-related learning loss, funded $750,000 in grants for instructional support and innovative programs.
To reduce classroom materials costs, provided grant funding for faculty to adopt, adapt, and create Open Educational Textbooks.
Policies Impacting Students
Reviewed Article 3 of the Student Code on Academic Policies and Regulations with an equity lens, provided findings to the Office of the Provost, and recommended policy changes to be implemented in the 2022-2023 Student Code.
Built on the work of the APLU Powered by Publics to examine grades in key gateway courses, rates of grades of D, F, and W, and review of courses in which disparities in “DFW rates” exist between the general student population and under-represented students.
Our focus moving forward includes plans to better understand and improve the first-year student experience and the transfer student experience, increasing access to the institution for under-represented students, and professional development for faculty to ensure excellent student experiences and outcomes regardless of where a student is located.
Student success takes all of us. If you're interested in engaging with the Student Success Initiative, please share your information.
We look forward to continued collaboration around the enhancement of undergraduate student success.

                April 29, 2022 11:16 AM
			
        Dear colleagues:
I am pleased to announce that Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs Javier Reyes has agreed to serve as interim chancellor of the University of Illinois Chicago.
Pending the approval of the Board of Trustees, Javier will lead the university beginning July 1, following the departure of Chancellor Michael Amiridis for the presidency of the University of South Carolina.
Javier’s work as provost and his almost two decades of higher education experience make him the right person to lead UIC and its more than 34,000 students and 13,000 faculty and staff while a search is conducted for a permanent chancellor.
For those who do not know, Javier joined UIC from West Virginia University where he was Milan Puskar Dean of the John Chambers College of Business and Economics and vice president for Startup West Virginia. He has a PhD in economics from Texas A&M University and a Bachelor of Arts in economics from the Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, Campus Estado de México.
Since coming to UIC in 2021 as provost, Javier has worked to build close relationships with faculty, staff and students while immersing himself in the operations and culture of UIC. He has reached out to leaders in the city of Chicago to listen and build stronger connections for the university, while also working closely with Chancellor Amiridis on the execution of their refreshed strategic plan. This includes working to provide more equitable opportunities and better access to the world-class education available at UIC, and supporting research that drives the kinds of innovation that promise a better way of life for coming generations.
Importantly, as provost, he also understands the value of shared governance and the spirit of collaboration that drives UIC forward.
As Javier himself said in a statement that will be released later today to news media, “Chancellor Amiridis has developed a strong leadership team here at UIC, one I am privileged to be a part of and will rely on in the months ahead. As interim chancellor, I look forward to working with faculty and staff as we continue to develop UIC as a crucial asset for the citizens of Chicago and the state of Illinois.”
A committee has been formed to lead the search for a permanent chancellor. An interim provost will soon be named to take on Javier’s current role while he serves as interim chancellor. Expect more news on that soon.
Now, please join me in welcoming Javier as interim chancellor and wishing him well in the months ahead.
Sincerely,Tim"

U of I System President Tim Killeen tests positive for COVID-19President isolating at home, working while he recuperates
URBANA, Ill. – University of Illinois System President Tim Killeen tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 on Saturday and, following guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is isolating at home in the President’s House at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
“My infection is an unfortunate reminder that the virus remains with us and that all of us must continue to take it seriously, remain vigilant and take reasonable precautions to prevent its spread,” Killeen said. “I am thankful to be fully vaccinated and doubly-boosted, and, thus far, my symptoms have been relatively mild.”
President Killeen is working at home while he rests and recuperates. His wife, Dr. Roberta Johnson Killeen, who is taking care of him, has so far tested negative for the virus.

        Dear campus community,
You likely have noticed the recent increase in malicious emails in your inbox. Universities around the globe are experiencing similar increases, and we’re working around the clock to mitigate the problem and prevent continued phishing attacks. Technology Services’ Privacy and Cybersecurity team is turning on the first of several planned solutions over the next few days.  
Outlook report spam button enabled starting April 25We will turn on a feature that allows you to report spam right from the toolbar. Faculty, staff, and students with an Outlook account should notice this option is available within the next few days. Using the Report Spam Outlook Add-in (uillinois.edu) 
Adding email address limits (rate limiting) starting May 2We are establishing new set limits on the number of email addresses that someone can send to in a 24-hour period via a Microsoft O365 mailbox. We have selected an allowable number that far exceeds usual daily email activity. Details are in this article: https://answers.uillinois.edu/illinois/page.php?id=118081A university O365 account is not the ideal way to send Massmail. The university has identified best practices and official tools for sending Massmail.

Remember, YOU are the first line of defense in keeping personal information and university data safe. Watch for messages that seem too good to be true, think before you click, and report suspicious emails immediately using the new report spam button. Cybercriminals continually evolve their phishing strategies, and the university will add new detection and prevention methods in coming weeks and months. By combining individual action with university tools, we can better safeguard people and resources.

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
The Massmail of April 13 stated that “The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion was incorrectly identified as a co-sponsor for a talk ‘Unfinished Business: Zionism as Racism and Racial Discrimination.” This is a mistake. To clarify, co-sponsorship had been sought and was approved for the speaker series entitled, “Blueprint for Transitional Justice in the United States: Building on Lessons and Insights from Global Perspectives” organized by the Illinois Global Institute and funded by the Chancellor’s Call to Action to Address Racism & Social Injustice Research Program. The goal of the lecture series has been to open discussion of difficult questions about contested histories of racism and discrimination by featuring speakers who highlight their complexities. The OVCDEI did not intend to appear to endorse or advocate for any of the perspectives presented throughout the series.
The mission of OVCDEI is to foster an inclusive community on our campus. While the OVCDEI strives to ensure no group feels excluded or silenced on our campus, the core mission of universities must include critical scrutiny of all commitments, ideologies, and claims, and a willingness to engage in a range of perspectives on profoundly controversial questions, especially with those with whom we are in fundamental disagreement. While co-sponsorship does not imply endorsement, the OVCDEI plays a role in convening those conversations, especially across contentious and difficult topics that address issues of justice and equity. Inclusion in the Illinois community must encompass all voices, and engagement on critical issues such as those in the Middle East must include all perspectives.
We realize that the title of the lecture may have been offensive to some, and the Massmail of April 13 also offended others. This is not surprising in view of the extremely difficult and painful nature of the Middle East conflict.
To be truly inclusive, our commitment to academic freedom is even more important when controversial topics are discussed. We strive to be the best shared learning community we can be. This statement is part of that process.

                April 20, 2022 10:01 AM
			
        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
Last night, the Champaign City Council approved a new intergovernmental agreement that will add an important new component in the public safety partnership between the University of Illinois Police Department (UIPD) and the Champaign Police Department (CPD). The agreement will add seven new officers at UIPD, update patrol responsibilities in the Campustown area and allow CPD to respond more quickly to calls for service across the rest of the community. The new patrol arrangements will be fully implemented by October 1, 2022, and last for two years with an option for a third.
Under the proposal, UIPD will begin responding to calls in a portion of Campustown previously serviced by the CPD. This will allow the CPD to reallocate patrol resources to other parts of the community while ensuring continued public safety in the Campustown area. This adjustment will free up CPD officers to handle other priority service needs across the city and should shorten response times. The City of Champaign will reimburse the university annually to fund the additional UIPD officers needed to respond to calls in that area. The university will provide the initial funding for costs related to training, vehicles, equipment and other expenses.
UIPD will assume jurisdictional responsibility for the area bordered by Springfield Avenue on the north, Wright Street on the east, Windsor Avenue on the south and Neil Street on the west. This is a zone that is home to a large number of our students as well as a number of businesses that are largely student-focused. This new coverage area is a good geographic and operational addition, as our officers and public safety personnel have a deep working knowledge of the needs of the residents as well as existing relationships with those in this area of the community.
I am grateful to the City of Champaign for this thoughtful and forward-looking initiative to provide the service levels in Campustown and throughout the community to keep all of us safer. This agreement is a direct outgrowth of the long, cooperative and mutually respectful relationships our university and all of our surrounding communities have built together.
We look forward to working with our community to adjust our plans in ways that are best for those we serve.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion was incorrectly identified as a co-sponsor for a campus lecture titled “Unfinished Business: Zionism as Racism and Racial Discrimination.” As worded, this title does not invite participation and engagement with all members of our community and does not represent the values of our university.
Academic freedom and freedom of expression are bedrock principles of this institution and are necessary for the exploration of controversial, divisive or uncomfortable issues – even those that are in opposition to this university’s clearly stated positions and values.
Any future lectures in this series will make it clear that these are not sponsored by our office nor do the viewpoints expressed represent the university.

        Dear faculty, staff, students and friends:
The new state budget passed by the Illinois General Assembly and expected to be signed by Gov. J.B. Pritzker will provide $655.2 million in general operating funds to the University of Illinois System for the coming fiscal year, as well as a $122 million increase for the Monetary Award Program (MAP), the state’s primary student financial aid program.
The state budget for the 2023 fiscal year, which begins July 1, will increase the U of I System appropriation by 5 percent over the current year. The budget passed also applies an additional $28.1 million supplemental appropriation to the current fiscal year’s $622 million in state operating funds, essentially providing the fiscal year 2023 increase a year early.
This marks the third consecutive year that legislators and the governor have maintained or increased U of I System funding. These increases signal continued recognition of the value the U of I System provides not only to our more than 94,000 students, but also to the state as a whole, and we are grateful to our legislators and governor for their investment in higher education.
Highlights of the budget include:
A $122 million increase for the state’s Monetary Award Program (MAP), which provides financial aid to Illinois students, including more than 22,000 across our U of I System universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield.
$1.36 billion in total capital re-appropriations across the system, of which $496.7 million will support continued planning and construction of the U of I System's Discovery Partners Institute and the statewide Illinois Innovation Network. Additionally, $862.5 million of re-appropriated capital funds will support a number of ongoing construction projects across our three universities. 
$3 million in new funding for the Illinois Innocence Project at the University of Illinois Springfield, part of a national program that works to exonerate wrongfully convicted people and reform the criminal justice system to prevent future injustice.
$2 million in new funding for the creation of a Climate Jobs Institute at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, to provide data, research and information that will help the state and its workforce transition to a clean-energy economy.
In addition to the budget, the legislature also approved regulatory measures that streamline and improve procurement, allowing the university system to more effectively engage minority vendors and conduct business in the state. The measures also establish a taskforce to report on further procurement reforms needed to legislate in the fall veto session.
We thank our U of I Caucus for its hard work and dedication during this budget process, and we appreciate the support of all of you in making the U of I System a powerful engine of progress for the state.
We are grateful to Gov. Pritzker and the legislature for their ongoing partnership, reflected in this budget which makes vital investments in higher education. We look forward to further collaboration as we work to ensure our universities have the financial backing to continue to deliver for the people of Illinois.

        Dear Colleagues,
With the end of the academic year in sight, we know that many units have started planning for the transition to summer work schedules. While summer often brings the promise of uninterrupted time to devote to research and scholarship, it is important to fully understand federal regulations related to summer salary.
As summer 2022 appointments are made, in compliance with the campus Policy on Effort and Compensation on Sponsored Projects and federal guidance, it is our expectation that college and departmental administration, business and HR staff will work together with faculty to enter summer appointments that compensate faculty for the sponsored work that they conduct during the summer. Critically, if a faculty member plans to engage in activities that aren’t allowed on a sponsored project during a given pay period, non-sponsored funds must be allocated to cover a portion of salary costs.  
If you are a faculty member who intends to be paid on sponsored funds during the summer of 2022, please review the Policy and talk with departmental staff to make sure that your appointment is structured to correspond to your summer plans as you request your summer appointment. This is an important step in fulfilling our institutional responsibility to accurately represent summer effort to our research sponsors.

        Dear Faculty Member:
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Senate is seeking nominations for service on the 2022-2023 Academic Senate Committees.
Senate committees are responsible for making decisions on educational offerings, student life, campus operations, inclusiveness, information technology, academic freedom, financial affairs, benefits, and general university policies. Serving on a Senate committee can be an enriching experience that enables you to develop new partnerships, advance your leadership skills, become more engaged with the University, and have a voice in shared governance.
We acknowledge that many of us are feeling overwhelmed and pulled in multiple directions during this challenging period. Participation in Academic Senate Committees is an important way for faculty of all ranks to be a part of the shared governance process that directly impacts our university.
Nominations & EligibilityYou do not need to be a senator to serve on a committee. However, we anticipate that meetings will again be held in-person beginning in fall 2022 so you must be able to physically attend meetings on campus. Please submit your interest and willingness to serve as soon as possible but not later than Friday, April 22, 2022, at https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/9526843.

                March 31, 2022 6:40 PM
			
        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
This afternoon we learned of another round of racist, hateful flyers found at various locations around the campus. As with several similar recent incidents, these flyers are appearing inside plastic bags filled with rocks.
This round of messages uses references to the Ku Klux Klan to bring hateful and threatening attacks against people of color in our community. This invocation of an organization that is synonymous with white supremacy, hatred and racially motivated death and violence is a singularly unsettling and unacceptable demonstration of racism and bigotry. We are a university that prides itself on its efforts to foster inclusion and respect and we condemn these messages that are yet another divisive affront to our core and mutual values.  
This is the second time in just a few weeks when I have had to publicly speak out in response to the hateful actions of cowardly individuals who spend their lives secretively dropping sandwich bags filled with gravel and bile. I’m tired of sending these messages and I’m angry that such smallminded people continue these stupid and futile attempts to foster division in our community. But I will never tire of speaking loudly and publicly in defense of the values that guide us here at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                March 31, 2022 5:02 AM
			
        Dear UIUC Community,
As the spring semester carries on, it is important to reflect on what we have done as individuals, students, and a campus community. The following is a summary of what various entities within Illinois Student Government (ISG) have been up to over the past semester.
Student Governance 
A select group of Illinois Student Government members will be in Washington D.C. April 3-6 for the Association of Big Ten Students (ABTS) Big Ten on The Hill (BTOTH) conference. We will be meeting with several members of the United States Congress from Illinois. Please click on the following link and select the top two issues you want us to discuss with the representatives. https://forms.gle/AfRgpwEewdVtAYNu6
Cultural Engagement
For Women’s History Month, ISG has been engaged with different programming to truly celebrate women. We partnered with La Casa Cultural Latina to host a panel on women in leadership, and how to run for student government. I was able to work alongside the Humanities Research Institute and the Women in Global Perspectives Program as a featured speaker for their International Women’s Day event, where I paid homage to Shirley Chisolm, the first Black woman in Congress. 
Campus Health
ISG Vice President, Nicole Arnold, and I have been coordinating with McKinley Health Center since October 2021 for an annual health fair. The health fair took place on March 30, 2022, from 10 am to 2 pm in Illini Union Rooms A, B, and C. There were giveaways, live entertainment, and, most importantly, health promotion. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us all how important and invaluable our personal health and the health of our communities is.
ISG is co-sponsoring a blood drive with Volunteer Illini Projects on April 12-15. There will be giveaways for participants. 
Campus Diversity 
ISG is hosting our annual “Free Expression Town Hall” on April 1 from 4-6 pm, in the Illini Union Room 407. Panelists include various professors, a student from the college of law, and a political science student. 
Campus Accessibility
Our Disability Advocacy Department has been working on addressing issues related to accessibility on campus. They have also been working with members of the university administration to increase accountability around disability accommodations and improve understanding of disability among course teaching staff.
Academic Initiatives
ISG contributed $3000 to the new Open Educational Resources (OER) Incentive Program this school year. Professors can apply to receive grants so they can convert their course materials to be open-source and free to access online, thus, decreasing the financial burden on students. So far, OER conversion on campus has saved students $46,000, and with numerous applications submitted by professors this March, that number will only grow in the future.

I invite you all to our weekly Senate meetings at 7:00 pm on Wednesdays on the 2nd floor of the Illini Union in the Ballroom.

                March 22, 2022 10:31 AM
			
        Dear students, faculty and staff:
I’m delighted to announce my recommendation of Dr. Janet L. Gooch as the new chancellor of the University of Illinois Springfield and vice president for the University of Illinois System, pending approval by our Board of Trustees. Dr. Gooch currently serves as executive vice president for academic affairs, provost and a professor in communication disorders for Truman State University, a public liberal arts university located in Kirksville, Mo., with a total enrollment of 4,000 students.
Following a comprehensive search, Dr. Gooch’s formidable background in academic leadership, focus on curricular innovation, keen strategic sensibilities and dedication to student success placed her at the top of a field of strong candidates. We believe she is the ideal choice for continuing to uphold the university’s commitment to excellence, strengthening and growing community partnerships and leading UIS to a new chapter of achievements and progress.
Dr. Gooch joined Truman in 1995, and has since served in a variety of roles, including dean of the School of Health Sciences and Education and department chair of Communication Disorders. She held interim roles as dean of the School of Science and Mathematics and director of Strategic Initiatives.
Effective July 1, 2022, Dr. Gooch will succeed interim Chancellor Karen M. Whitney, who has provided exemplary leadership of UIS since July 2020.
Dr. Gooch earned a bachelor’s degree in speech-language pathology from the University of Kansas, as well as a master’s degree from Kent State University and a doctorate from Case Western Reserve University in the same field of study. She has served as co-chair on the membership committee for the Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges (COPLAC) and as a member of the planning committee and facilitator for its Leadership Circle. She has also held numerous leadership positions on the board of directors for the Missouri Foundation for Health.
Dr. Gooch is married to Richard L. Gooch, D.D.S., and they have three grown children.
Later this morning, news of her recommended appointment will be released to news media and the public. You can read the news release below.
We are most excited to welcome Dr. Gooch into the University of Illinois family and look forward to her arrival this summer.
Best wishes,
Tim

Janet L. Gooch named chancellor at University of Illinois Springfield Gooch joins UIS after leadership role at Truman State University
Janet L. Gooch, the executive vice president for academic affairs and provost at Truman State University, an accomplished higher education leader and educator, has been named chancellor of the University of Illinois Springfield and vice president for the University of Illinois System, pending formal approval by the Board of Trustees at its May 19 meeting. Gooch will take office on July 1 and succeed interim Chancellor Karen M. Whitney, who has served in that role since July 1, 2020. Whitney followed Chancellor Susan Koch, who retired in 2020.
Gooch, 56, has been executive vice president and provost at Truman State University since 2017 and has been an administrator and member of the faculty at the university in Kirksville, Mo., since 1995. She brings a wide range of experience to her new role as chancellor at UIS and its more than 3,900 students and more than 900 faculty and staff.
Prior to serving as executive vice president and provost, Gooch was dean of Truman’s School of Health Sciences and Education and, prior to that, department chair of Communication Disorders. She held interim roles as dean of the School of Science and Mathematics and director of Strategic Initiatives. She is a professor in the Department of Communication Disorders.
“I am deeply honored to have the opportunity to join the University of Illinois Springfield and lead this regional powerhouse in the years ahead. I look forward to getting to know the students, faculty and staff at UIS, as well as the city of Springfield, and working together as we chart a course that provides opportunities for our students and serves the region as both an educator and an economic engine,” Gooch said. “Chancellors Whitney and Koch have made access and equity priorities at UIS, and I plan to continue to build on that work. This will mean opening doors for more and more students and providing them with the tools to reach their full potential, helping build a better and sustainable future for us all.”
University of Illinois System President Tim Killeen said Gooch’s wealth of experience at 4,200-student Truman and her focus on access and equity will make her “an ideal chancellor for UIS and the U of I System.”
“Dr. Gooch has long been an innovative leader at Truman State University, as well as a respected educator,” Killeen added. “Her vision for UIS is based on this track record of success and a deep investment in collaboration that will serve the university, its students and faculty and the entire university system well.”
As executive vice president and provost at Truman, Gooch led Academic Affairs through the successful completion of the university’s five-year strategic plan for 2015-20 and development of the new plan for 2021-25. She also helped lead the university through the redesign of its undergraduate liberal studies program and supported the development of new online graduate programs in mental health and school counseling, disability studies, data science and analytic storytelling and gifted education, among others. New undergraduate programs were developed in music therapy, biochemistry and molecular biology, and a bachelor of science degree in philosophy and religion.
Gooch also brings a strong history of leadership in diversity, equity and inclusion, including initiating the creation of Truman’s TruSelf Program, designed to provide support to historically underrepresented students and improve retention and graduation rates, as well as collaborating on the development of the university’s Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan.
“UIS is an innovator in a range of fields, and an established provider of high-quality teaching and a student-centered educational experience,” Gooch said. “These are major assets that we can leverage to increase access and offer life-changing opportunities to growing numbers of Illinoisans from all backgrounds.”
Gooch received her doctorate in speech-language pathology from Case Western Reserve University in 1997, a master’s degree in speech-language pathology from Kent State University in 1990, and her bachelor’s degree in speech-language pathology in 1988 from the University of Kansas.
She was chosen from three finalists and a robust pool of qualified applicants.
A committee chaired by UIS Professor Beverly Bunch advised system Executive Vice President and Vice President for Academic Affairs Avijit Ghosh and Killeen in the search.
Gooch is married to Richard L. Gooch, D.D.S. They have three grown children.

                March 21, 2022 10:02 AM
			
        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
Beginning today, Monday, March 21, faculty, staff and students who are not fully vaccinated with a university-verified vaccination record in the MyMcKinley Portal will be required to test once per week, instead of the previous requirement to test every other day. 
This decision has been made in light of loosening restrictions and recommendations from our own SHIELD team, the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD), the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Based on our own data and science from experts, we are confident in our decision to reduce testing frequencies while continuing to maximize safety for our community.
The university will continue to maintain the requirement of testing once per week until Governor J.B. Pritzker lifts the current COVID-19 Executive Order No. 87 which requires all unvaccinated higher education personnel and students to test once per week.
The rest of the university’s COVID-19 guidelines are still in place:
COVID-19 Guidelines
All undergraduate students who have not received their return test since Spring Break should take an on-campus test before March 25 to remain in compliance and continue to have building access.
All fully vaccinated graduate students, faculty and staff who traveled over Spring Break are also strongly encouraged to take an on-campus test before March 25.
The targeted testing program will remain in place. All residents of any building that is identified as having a higher prevalence of COVID-19 than the state average are required to test every other day until further notice. Individuals in these buildings will be emailed when they should begin testing, and they will be emailed again when the targeted testing requirement is lifted.
The current face coverings guidance remains in place. Face coverings continue to be required in classrooms during in-person class time. They are not required in other sections of buildings that have classrooms. They are also required in some additional spaces like COVID-19 testing sites, Willard Airport, on MTD busses, in the McKinley Health Center, etc. See the face coverings page for the full policy.
As a reminder, there are to be no additional expectations for face coverings for units, facilities and events, but individuals are always welcome to wear a face covering to protect themselves.
After returning from Spring Break, if you have issues seeing your Building Access pass in your Illinois app, please see these instructions.
I am grateful for lower case counts and increasing information from experts that enable us to loosen these testing requirements. I sincerely hope this is a trend that continues through the rest of the semester. Thank you for your continued patience, understanding and compassion for one another.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Colleagues,
I am pleased to announce that Mark S. Cohen, MD, has been selected to serve as the next, permanent dean of the Carle Illinois College of Medicine. Pending approval by the Board of Trustees, Dr. Cohen’s appointment will begin on May 16, 2022. Dr. Cohen will also hold the position of senior vice president and chief academic officer at Carle Health.
Following a national search for this position, Dr. Cohen emerged as the best candidate to serve as the second dean of the college and to lead its students, faculty and staff in this next critical phase of its future growth and success.
Dr. Cohen is currently a professor of surgery, of pharmacology and of biomedical engineering at the University of Michigan. He serves as the vice chair in surgery for clinical operations, he is the director of the Center for Surgical Innovation, and the director of endocrine surgery research. In the medical school, he serves as the director of the Pathway of Excellence in Innovation and Entrepreneurship, which he initiated. He is a recipient of the Faculty Recognition Award for Innovation and of the Provost’s Teaching Innovation Award. He earned a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering and a medical doctorate from Washington University in St. Louis. He completed his general surgery residency and a National Institutes of Health-sponsored fellowship in endocrine and oncologic surgery at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis.
Throughout his career, Dr. Cohen has established himself as a prolific researcher, an accomplished clinician, a dedicated educator and a true innovator in both the practice and teaching of medicine. His clear vision for advancing the excellence of Carle Illinois, combined with his enthusiasm about the opportunities to further enhance the college’s teaching, research, innovation and service missions, established him as the choice to be the next dean.
I wish to thank Dr. Uretz Oliphant for agreeing to continue in his current role as interim dean of the college through the end of this semester. And I also thank the members of the search committee, chaired by Vice Chancellor Susan Martinis, for their efforts and commitment that led to Dr. Cohen’s appointment.
Please join me in congratulating Dr. Mark Cohen and in welcoming him to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign as the dean of the Carle Illinois College of Medicine.
Sincerely,

        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
The Illini Success team has just released this year’s edition of the Illini Success report, an annual review of post-graduation destinations of our recent bachelor’s degree graduates. Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our graduates still found jobs, enrolled in graduate school or began volunteer programs on par with previous years.
Here are a few of the highlights from the new report:
94% of our 2020-2021 graduates secured a job, graduate program or volunteer opportunity within six months of graduation.
75% of in-state graduates who began a job or graduate program said they remained in Illinois for those opportunities.
$68,701 is the average salary for full-time employed graduates.
The full report can be viewed on the Illini Success website. An accessible version of the report is available by contacting the Illini Success team at illinisuccess@illinois.edu.
It is gratifying to see that an Illinois degree provided so many of our recent graduates with a solid foundation for these critical first steps in their future careers. This is fantastic news that illustrates the impact of an Illinois degree. I am incredibly proud of our recent graduates, and I am extremely thankful for our faculty and staff members who ensure that our students succeed.
I hope you will all join me in celebrating the success of our recent graduates.

        Dear students, faculty and staff:
On behalf of the University of Illinois System, we are deeply outraged by the unprovoked and brutal invasion of Ukraine and the worsening humanitarian crisis facing the people there. We stand with the Association of Public & Land Grant Universities in sharply condemning the unnecessary use of force and calling for an end to this devastating conflict.
During this very difficult time, the safety and well-being of our students and other members of our U of I community who are impacted by this tragedy are our No. 1 priority. Our three universities have been reaching out directly to offer support resources to students, staff and faculty who may be in need.
As a university system, which welcomes students from all over the world and has a long history of global reach and partnership, we hold dear our values of inclusivity and treating each other with dignity and respect, and we advocate for peaceful diplomacy as the means to conflict resolution. We will continue to support each other and promote civility for every member of the U of I System community, at our universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield, across the country and around the world.
We understand the situation may be very stressful and cause anxiety for some. If you need help, please don’t hesitate to reach out to the student or employee services office at your university. There are many available support resources, which are shown in the links below.
Our deepest sympathy goes to all those who are suffering, and we stand firm in disavowing the violence and the destruction being forced upon the people of Ukraine.

You may receive this negative result between Thursday, March 17 and Friday, March 25.
You will continue to have “Granted” access until the end of the day on Friday, March 25 to give you time to meet this requirement.
In-person classes will continue as planned starting March 21.
As a reminder, face coverings will still be required in classrooms during in-person class time.
We know that Spring Break is an important time for you to disconnect and relax. I hope you take advantage of the week to recharge and get ready for the final weeks of the semester.
I am so grateful for all of your efforts to protect one another throughout this entire year. I know we all look forward to returning to a life that doesn’t require these additional precautions. In the meantime, thank you for your continued care for one another.

Any member of the campus community (faculty, staff, or students) may make nominations.  A program description may be found on the Illinois Human Resources website at: CDSA Program.  Nominations may be made at http://go.illinois.edu/cdsanomination.  Nominations will close at 5:00 p.m. on Monday, April 25, 2022.
Up to eight civil service staff members will be honored at a reception hosted by the Chancellor, where they will receive a $1,000 award and a commemorative plaque.  A permanent plaque in the Illinois Human Resources Office commemorates recipients for each year.
The work of this campus could not be carried on without the dedicated support of our civil service staff.  This program provides an opportunity for all of us to show our appreciation to those individuals whose service has been exceptional.  I encourage you to participate in the nomination process for what has been a genuinely meaningful and appreciated recognition program.
Full-time civil service staff with at least two years of full-time service at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign are eligible.

        Dear Colleagues,
As we finalize our review of applications for admission for the Fall 2022 semester, in cooperation with the Senate Committee on Admissions, we would like to remind you of the university policies regarding admissions confidentiality and third-party inquiries. Admissions officers may discuss a student’s application only with the applicant, the applicant’s parents/legal guardian, spouse or school-appointed counselor. Other individuals, including university employees without admissions responsibilities, are not permitted to inquire about a student’s application with a university admissions officer, and admissions officers are prohibited from sharing information with third parties regarding a student’s application.
A university admissions officer is considered anyone with admissions responsibility. This includes not only admissions staff in central admissions units such as the Office of Undergraduate Admissions and the Graduate College, but also faculty and staff within academic college and departmental offices responsible for reviewing and making decision recommendations for applicants. A firewall has been placed around faculty, administrators and admissions staff with admissions responsibility so that those without admissions responsibility may not influence decisions.
Unsolicited letters of recommendation or emails of support or appeal are not accepted or considered in our processes. Please review this Summary of University of Illinois Admissions Firewall Practices for a complete list of inquiries that are and are not permitted, as well as examples of scenarios and appropriate responses.
At the graduate level, it is important to note that those with admissions responsibility are allowed to accept information from an applicant’s recommenders in the form of formal letters, emails and phone communications; however, they may not discuss the applicant’s admission status with the recommender. If they are contacted about an applicant’s admission status by a recommender, they are to notify the recommender that while they may accept supporting information for the applicant’s file, they may not discuss the applicant’s admission status without expressed written permission from the applicant. Also at the graduate level, the Graduate College discourages any discussions with an applicant’s parent and/or spouse regarding the applicant’s status without the written permission from the applicant.
Inappropriate activities or attempts to circumvent these policies should be reported to the Ethics Officer or reported anonymously using the anonymous report feature of the Admissions Inquiry Log.
Thank you for helping to protect the integrity of our admissions process.
Sincerely,
Andrew Borst Director of Undergraduate AdmissionsOffice of Undergraduate Admissions

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
This weekend has brought multiple reports of anti-Semitic and hateful flyers being dropped in different locations on and around campus inside plastic bags filled with small rocks.
These messages are offensive, outrageous and they represent unacceptable attacks on members of our Jewish community. They are antithetical to our university values of inclusion and tolerance, and they are another disheartening example of the kind of anti-Semitic acts and expressions that are too common in our nation and right here in the community where we all live, learn and work.
The University of Illinois Police Department (UIPD) is seeking information to identify the individual or individuals responsible. If you have any information or think you have camera footage that might be helpful, I encourage you to reach out immediately to UIPD by phone (217-333-1216) or email (police@illinois.edu).
Sneaking around and delivering hateful, hurtful and racist messages in little plastic sandwich bags filled with gravel is a cowardly and craven way to spew hate and division in our community.
But I am so very proud that, time after time, here at Illinois during these past couple of very, very hard years, our students, staff and faculty come together at their very best when it is time to take care of one another.
I ask that we all come together once again to show that the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is a place where people of all faiths, races, gender identities, ethnicities, national origins and viewpoints can live, learn and thrive.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Another round of severe winter weather is beginning throughout Central Illinois. This latest winter storm system will start with mixed precipitation, including initial light ice accumulation, followed by 4 to 7 inches of snow for Champaign County.
This afternoon, rapidly deteriorating weather conditions will immediately create slippery sidewalks, pathways, parking lots, and roads. Also, the projected timing of snow bands and high winds will likely cause low visibility and hazardous travel, especially throughout the evening commute hours. 
Facilities & Services staff will begin snow and ice removal operations once the precipitation changeover happens. The combination of freezing temperatures and blowing and drifting snow later tonight is expected to worsen many campus areas and could significantly reduce the effectiveness of initial clearing activities into Friday.
Please use caution when traveling on campus while the storm is active and as long as extreme temperatures are causing persistent areas of snow and ice. More information about these F&S snow and ice removal procedures, including a list of priority parking lot locations, is available at https://go.fs.illinois.edu/snow.

        Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,
With potentially dangerous levels of snow, wind and ice in the forecast, the university will move to online classes and essential operations for Thursday afternoon beginning at 2:00 p.m. Subject to operational needs, non-essential employees are permitted to leave campus at that time and complete the workday remotely or without use of personal benefit time. Instructors who are not able to move their classes online should cancel class or provide alternative educational experiences available to students. We are asking instructors to make any cancellation decisions in consultation with their unit executive officers. Midterm exams held this afternoon or evening should also have an option for a conflict exam should any students not be able to attend.
Decisions about cancellation or rescheduling of previously scheduled events will be made by the sponsoring organization or venue. You should check directly with the sponsor before attending any event this evening.
We expect that in-person classes will resume tomorrow (Friday) morning.
Please check your email and university social channels frequently this afternoon and evening for any additional updates.
Until the potentially dangerous weather situation has cleared, please let health and safety considerations – both your own and others – guide your decisions and actions.

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
As you know, earlier this month Governor J.B. Pritzker announced a partial lift of the State of Illinois indoor mask mandate by the end of February. He also recommended that organizations should interpret this guidance to fit their circumstances. We are writing to share details about how the university will operate in terms of face coverings and other COVID-19 operations starting Feb. 28. Until this time, all COVID-19 guidelines and requirements will remain in place.
COVID-19 guidelines beginning Monday, Feb. 28
Face coverings will still be required in instructional spaces during in-person classes and passing periods.
Face coverings will no longer be required indoors at non-instructional university facilities EXCEPT:
Face coverings will still be required in healthcare facilities. For example, these include COVID-19 testing sites, McKinley Health Center, etc.
Face coverings will still be required in spaces governed by the federal mandate. For example, these include Willard Airport, Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District (MTD) buses, etc.
Depending on the space and work, certain research labs may still require face coverings.
Some university events may still require face coverings as dictated in contracts. For example, the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts will continue to require face coverings at certain ticketed events until further notice.

All COVID-19 testing requirements will remain in place, and on-campus testing sites will continue.
Wellness Support Associates will continue to spot check Building Access Status at instructional buildings, and “Building Access Granted” will still be required to attend in-person classes.
Proof of a negative COVID-19 test or COVID-19 vaccination will no longer be required to attend university-sponsored events open to the public. This includes athletic events at State Farm Center. This also includes summer camps and commencement ceremonies. Please note that some university events may still require proof of a negative COVID-19 test or COVID-19 vaccination as dictated in contracts.
The COVID-19 vaccine and booster requirement will remain in place. If you haven’t received your vaccine or booster and you are eligible, you should make an appointment as soon as possible at vaccines.gov.
If you are unsure about COVID-19 guidelines, please check with the specific facility or email covid-19@ilinois.edu.
Our world-class testing ecosystem and our rapidly decreasing positive cases give us confidence in our approach, and we will continue to provide access to free on-campus testing for our faculty, staff and students. We will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation on campus, and we are prepared to quickly adjust our approach if necessary.
I also want to emphasize that as we enter this new phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may not all experience the same emotions. Some will welcome the loosening of some COVID-19 mandates, while others may experience some level of discomfort with this change. Please know that if you decide to continue to wear a face covering in university spaces for yourself or your loved ones, you should do so without hesitation, and the university will absolutely support you in that decision.
At this time, it is especially important that we extend concern, compassion and understanding to one another, regardless of the individual choices. I have been so incredibly proud of our university community throughout this pandemic, and I hope that we can continue to be united in our care for one another as we continue to move forward together.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Students and Employees,
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug Free Workplace Act and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act require the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:
http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/
The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.
Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to marijuana in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s marijuana prohibition.
The university’s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.
The university’s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.
Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. University employees should contact Illinois Human Resources at (217) 333-2137.

Those efforts will extend into the weekend ahead of the return to in-person classes next week. This morning, campus conditions were greatly improved due to the repeated clearing passes made since Wednesday.
Sidewalks/PathwaysAlmost all campus sidewalks and pathways have been cleared. Crews are now focused on scraping down the snowpack and widening areas from edge to edge. When temperatures are more favorable, F&S will apply additional brine solution and salt treatments to address persistent snow and ice areas, especially at intersections and curb cuts.
Building EntrancesEntrances are receiving ongoing attention from building service workers. Ice melt applications will be made to complement snow and ice removal activities around facilities in locations where necessary.
Parking Lots/RoadsBecause of snow clearance mounds, parking lots will remain slick and more congested than typical. F&S is coordinating with the Parking Department to begin clearing those collection areas and also use heavy equipment to address any lots that experience major snowdrifts. Since the conclusion of snowfall Thursday evening, general road conditions have steadily progressed within the University District.
Variable travel conditions will still exist throughout the weekend because of below-freezing temperatures. Please use caution and slow down while walking, biking, or driving on campus, and be aware of the following:
Periods of sunshine will result in daytime thaws followed by possible refreezing.
Hard-packed snow and ice will remain on some surfaces.
Steps, ramps, pedestrian bridges, and elevated surfaces will remain slippery. Utilize handrails if possible.

        Dear colleagues:
The news release below regarding Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s budget proposal will be sent to news media later this afternoon.
 
Budget proposal would provide needed investment in U of I System, students Gov. Pritzker’s proposal would increase 2023 appropriation by $28 million
URBANA, Ill. – Under the fiscal year 2023 budget proposed today by Gov. J.B. Pritzker, the state appropriation for the University of Illinois System would increase by $28 million over the current fiscal year. Additional one-time funding proposed by the governor would increase current-year funds by another $28 million. These proposals, if enacted, would provide much-needed investment in the system’s three universities and our students.
The governor also recommended a $122 million increase for the state’s Monetary Award Program (MAP), which provides financial aid to Illinois students, including thousands across the U of I System universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield.
“We appreciate the governor’s strong support of public higher education and his sustained partnership with the state’s public universities. Investment in public higher education delivers a return like few other expenditures a state can make, and we support his plan for the coming fiscal year,” University of Illinois System President Tim Killeen said. 
“We now look forward to working with the governor and other elected leaders from across the state in the weeks ahead in support of a budget that reinvests in Illinois and appropriately reflects the importance of the U of I System and public higher education,” Killeen added.
###
The University of Illinois System is a world leader in research and discovery, and the largest educational institution in the state with more than 94,000 students, about 26,000 full-time equivalent faculty and staff, and universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield. The U of I System awards more than 24,000 undergraduate, graduate and professional degrees annually."

                February 1, 2022 2:52 PM
			
        The National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning beginning at 9 p.m. for Champaign County. This winter storm system is expected to start with an initial freezing rain and sleet mixture, followed by snow accumulations of over 12 inches through Thursday. Blowing and drifting snow are also likely due to winds gusting as high as 35 mph, creating the potential for refreezing and persistent areas of snow and ice on sidewalks, pathways, building steps, parking lots, and roads.
Due to this winter storm's anticipated timing and severity, F&S snow and ice removal operations are already underway on campus, beginning with pretreatment activities and operators readying vehicles and equipment. Removal work will begin early Wednesday morning, emphasizing snow and ice clearance for all 24-hour university facilities, primary building entrances and service areas, and Americans with Disabilities Act ramps.
The chance for some icing followed by deep snow will make for a challenging and lengthy removal process and create extremely slippery conditions. Travel will be hazardous throughout this period, so please use caution if you must venture outside and allow extra time to reach your destination. 
Snow Priority Parking LotsBecause of the amount of snow forecasted and the strength of wind predicted, using smaller parking lots during the storm may leave vehicles prone to blockage by snowdrifts. This can occur in spaces or at lot entry/exit points. The following priority parking lots will be cleared first and regularly maintained during the weather event. Individuals are strongly advised to use these locations along with MTD service. Greater use of these sites will also help expedite plow trucks toward the end of the storm system. 
Lot B4, Levels Four and Five (North Campus) – Parking facility at the corner of University Avenue and Mathews Avenue
Shuttle Lot E14 (South Campus) –  West of the State Farm Center, south end only
Lot F27 (South Campus) – Adjacent to the Veterinary Medicine Basic Sciences Building
Vehicles parked in priority lots B4, E14, and F27 with a valid virtual permit for other rental facilities will not be cited for violations; however, enforcement will continue for parking in disabled spaces, yellow zones, or blocking driveways.
How You Can Help F&S CrewsAs F&S staff perform this priority work, please help grounds workers, transportation drivers, and building service workers by giving them as much space as possible. Active storms may significantly reduce visibility. Never walk close to, in front of, or obstruct plowing or service vehicles in motion. These actions will help with a safer and more efficient snow and ice removal process.
More information about university snow and ice removal efforts is available at https://go.fs.illinois.edu/snow. To report areas for additional treatment or if you have questions, contact the F&S Service Office fsserviceoffice@illinois.edu, 217-333-0340.
Your patience and cooperation are appreciated as F&S staff work near-continuous shifts throughout the winter storm to keep the campus open and accessible.
Sincerely,
Ehab KamarahInterim Executive Director, Facilities & Services"

        Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,
With potentially dangerous levels of snow, wind and ice in the forecast and expected K-12 school and daycare closures, the university will move to online classes and essential operations for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.
Classes are NOT cancelled, and the university is not closed. Decisions about cancellation or rescheduling of previously scheduled events will be made by the sponsoring organization or venue. You should check directly with the sponsor before attending any event this week.
Our goal is to reduce the number of people on the campus to allow limited staff to provide essential support services to our students and to let F&S safely clear sidewalks, streets and parking lots.
What is happening with classes and instruction for the rest of the week?
There will be NO in-person classes on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday, but we hope and expect that faculty and instructors will move in-person classes to an online format for the rest of the week.
In cases where this transition is not feasible, we strongly encourage you to make alternative educational experiences available to your students.
Instructors should communicate with students directly about weather-related plans as soon as possible.
Classes that are already online or remote should plan to meet as scheduled.
We are asking everyone to be flexible and thoughtful in accommodating those who experience any technology/connectivity issues or any other weather-related issues as we move through the week.
What if I am required to test regularly this week?
All testing sites will be closed on Wednesday. 
If you are currently required to test regularly, please go test today if possible.
We expect only the Illini Union testing site to resume normal operations Thursday at noon for those who need it, but you should always check the COVID-19 website to confirm a location’s operating status and hours.
Students should plan to resume your required testing schedule as soon as you are able to do so.
If you do fall out of testing compliance while the sites are closed, you will not be subject to disciplinary action during that time.
Your building access will not be granted until you are in compliance again.
What should employees do for the rest of the week?
All employees should start by reading this message sent by Illinois Human Resources on Tuesday morning.
The university encourages employees to carefully consider your personal safety and local conditions in determining their ability to commute to work in extreme weather.
Everyone who can work remotely should plan to do so if possible (with approval by your unit) on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.
Supervisors are strongly encouraged to facilitate remote work arrangements during this weather-related emergency.
We are asking supervisors to be flexible and thoughtful in accommodating employees who experience any technology or connectivity issues.
If you cannot work remotely and you are unable to come in to work in-person due to the weather, you will be asked to use the appropriate leave benefit time.
There are some operations at the university that must continue regardless of weather conditions. Those essential units will have clearly defined policies for employee coverage that will be communicated directly to those individuals who are affected.
Please check your email and university social channels frequently for the rest of the week for any additional updates.
We’ve avoided most of the winter’s snow and ice so far this season. But it appears likely these next few days will make up for that in a spectacular way. We know the emergency transition to online classes and essential operations will bring challenges to everyone. Until the potentially dangerous weather situation has cleared, please let health and safety considerations – both your own and others – guide your decisions and actions.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

        Dear Colleagues,
I am pleased to announce that Shari Mickey-Boggs has been chosen to serve as the Senior Associate Chancellor for Human Resources at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Her title will be interim Senior Associate Chancellor for Human Resources until it is approved by the Board of Trustees. She will begin in this role on March 1.
Shari is currently Chief HR Officer at Wright State University. In this role, she has been responsible for human resources consulting and strategy, talent management, employee and labor relations, compensation and training and compliance. She also served two years as the Secretary to the Board of Trustees.
Shari has more than 27 years of university experience, and before she was at Wright State University, she held HR positions at Xavier University and Ohio State University. She holds a bachelor’s in political science from Ohio State University and a master’s of business administration from Franklin University.
As Senior Associate Chancellor for Human Resources, Shari will play a vital role in leading the university’s human resources function as we move into our Next 150 years, with a focus on our Operational Excellence initiative to implement changes to more clearly define roles and responsibilities, improve services and align resources with institutional priorities.
I’d like to extend my sincere thanks to the search committee, chaired by Dean Jeff Brown, for its careful work in recruiting and evaluating an outstanding selection of applicants and in guiding the search process over the past months.
I also want to express my deep appreciation for Deb Stone, who has been serving as interim Senior Associate Chancellor for Human Resources since Elyne Cole retired in June. Deb’s strong and careful leadership in the past several months has provided stability for Human Resources and for the university, especially in light of many COVID-19 challenges.
I hope you will join me in congratulating Shari Mickey-Boggs once she arrives on campus in this role at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
Sincerely,
Robert J. Jones Chancellor"

        Dear Faculty and Staff,
As part of The Next 150 Strategic Plan (2018-2023), the university is continuing the Operational Excellence at Illinois initiative by partnering with Huron Consulting Group to advance our administrative services in specific areas: (1) budget & procurement, (2) IT & data, (3) human resources (4) physical space and (5) marketing and communications.
The initiative is being led by the Operational Excellence at Illinois Task Force, which includes university leadership from each area. There are also five work teams comprised of faculty and staff from across campus.
The goal of this initiative is to identify opportunities for strategic or operational improvements in organizational structures, service delivery, business process, technology enablement and talent pools. Though we are still in the early phases of the initiative, we are confident this work will reduce duplicated efforts, streamline processes and create resource centers across administrative services. This project is designed to ensure our administrative services support and promote both our university missions and those who make these missions possible.
I want to be clear that our approach for this initiative does not propose holistic centralization of services or eliminating positions. In fact, one of our goals is to provide more opportunities for individuals to move into new or specialized roles, along with more consistent titles, classifications and compensation to improve equity across the university.
As we move forward, we invite you to engage and offer input, as your participation will be vital to the success of this initiative.  Learn more by visiting the Operational Excellence at Illinois website, as we will add information on the progress and opportunities to participate. If you have any questions or concerns, I encourage you to email operationalexcellence@illinois.edu.
It is a strategic time for this university and this initiative. The pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic have revealed an extraordinary capability by our community to collaborate and innovate. Let’s work together to harness strength to advance this university and maximize our missions even further.
Thank you in advance for your collaboration, your insights and your support of this initiative.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
As you have likely seen, the University of Illinois System sent this email message requiring that all faculty, staff and students receive a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot as soon as they are eligible.
We are in full support of this requirement. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has already been recommending that everyone should receive a COVID-19 vaccine booster. With the emergence of the Omicron variant and holiday travel, increasing positive COVID-19 cases present real risks, and the requirement of a booster shot adds to our multi-layered approach to maximizing everyone’s safety.
We know the toll the COVID-19 pandemic has placed on everyone, and we understand that quickly changing information—especially during winter break—can be confusing. We plan to provide time for everyone to receive their booster (when they are eligible) to meet this new requirement, and we will provide more information to you after the Spring 2022 semester begins.
COVID-19 Vaccine Boosters
If you have already received a COVID-19 booster, thank you for doing your part to protect yourself and those around you.
If you have not received a COVID-19 vaccine booster and are eligible, we strongly encourage you to receive a booster before you return to campus if you are able. You can find appointments at pharmacies in your area on this website. (Note: If you are a student and are not able to receive a booster before you return to campus, you can make an appointment in the MyMcKinley Portal to receive a booster when you return to campus.)
If you received all your doses in the state of Illinois and you already have a verified vaccine record on file, you do NOT need to upload your booster record to the MyMcKinley Portal at this time. All Illinois-based vaccines should be automatically captured in the McKinley Medicat system within a few weeks of receiving your vaccination. 
If you received any of your COVID-19 vaccine shots (first dose, second dose or booster) outside the state of Illinois, you should upload your record to the MyMcKinley Portal.
Thank you for your patience and understanding as we continue to make science-based decisions to maximize the safety of our university community.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear students, faculty and staff:
A few weeks ago, we encouraged all faculty, staff and students to get a COVID-19 booster shot. Due to recent increases in COVID-19 cases, evolving information about the more transmissive Omicron variant, and new CDC guidance, the University of Illinois System is now requiring that all faculty, staff and students get a COVID-19 booster shot as soon as they are eligible (see the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for details on eligibility).
There is now significant evidence that vaccinations plus boosters are effective at preventing infections from developing into serious illness.
Those who have already received exemptions from the vaccination requirement for medical or religious reasons will be exempted from the booster requirement. For employees covered by a union contract, guidance will be implemented at the universities through the applicable collective bargaining processes.
Please look for further, more detailed, communication from your university on boosters and other safety measures applicable to each campus.
Throughout the pandemic we have worked diligently to keep our universities and their surrounding communities safe. Now, in the face of this new variant, we must again act collectively to protect both the health and safety of our communities and the quality of the educational experience that makes the U of I System truly extraordinary. 
We will continue to monitor our policies, adjusting where appropriate based on advances in scientific understanding and updated guidance from public health authorities.
Thank you again for your vigilance and your commitment to each other. I hope you had a joyous holiday season and a restful break. 
Sincerely, Tim"

                January 5, 2022 11:00 AM
			
        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
The university is making some updates to the previously announced COVID-19 guidelines for Spring 2022. Please see more information on the COVID-19 webpage for Spring 2022 guidelines.
Update to Spring 2022 Guidelines 
Students are no longer required to receive an off-campus COVID-19 test before they return to campus. If you have access to test, it is still recommended, but it is no longer a requirement. Students are still required to receive one negative on-campus test.
Faculty, staff and graduate students are now required to receive only one negative on-campus test to meet the requirement. When you receive a negative test result, your building access status will switch to “granted.” The re-entry testing timeline started on Monday, Jan. 3. The deadline for completion of a negative test is Jan. 15 if you are working on campus.
We hope some employees will test prior to their first day back on campus, although we know some will test on their first day back on campus. We also know that with the current surge in cases, some will feel more comfortable working remotely until they have received their negative test result. Where possible, we encourage supervisors to be flexible for staff, whose work can be completed remotely, until they have received a negative test result.  
The university is adopting new guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) that shorten quarantine and isolation timeframes to five days.
As an additional level of protection, the university is recommending that faculty, staff and students wear an N95 mask, a KN95 mask or a Level 3 surgical mask. See more information on the face coverings page of the university’s COVID-19 website.
If you test positive at an off-campus location during Winter Break, you should upload your positive test result to the MyMcKinley Portal. This is extremely important, so you are not re-isolated if you test positive upon return.
The Safer Illinois app has been retired and is no longer usable for building access or COVID-19 testing information. You will need to use the Illinois App (download it from the App Store for iPhone users or Google Play for Android users) or the Boarding Pass to show your building access status. 
We will still have instruction online the first week of the semester, Jan. 18-21. The purpose of this temporary shift in modality is to allow everyone to return safely and have time to receive an on-campus test for in-person instruction. Currently, we do not expect or plan to extend this delayed start beyond that first week. We plan to resume face-to-face instruction on Jan. 24. Students should have completed their negative test by that date.
We know the toll the COVID-19 pandemic has placed on everyone, and we understand that quickly changing information—especially during winter break—can be confusing. Thank you for your patience and understanding. I am grateful for all your efforts to care for yourself and for one another.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

That's why Facilities & Services, the Illini Union, Campus Recreation, and the McKinley Health Center are beginning an initiative to recruit new employees for open building service worker (BSW) positions more actively. This collaborative and proactive effort aims to maintain a full staffing complement that ensures faculty, students, and staff will continue to receive essential custodial services and project or special event support.
The units will host a career fair to attract candidates and expedite the hiring process for applicants on Saturday, January 8, at the I Hotel and Conference Center. The fair will provide an opportunity for applicants to complete the entire State Universities Civil Service System (SUCCS) hiring process at one time with assistance from Illinois Human Resources staff. During the fair, interviews will be held, and successful applicants will be contacted approximately one week later with conditional offers.

More information about the career fair, including registration, competitive wages, benefits, and job responsibilities and requirements, is available at fs.illinois.edu/jobs. 
The last two years have reinforced the vital role that BSWs perform by protecting the campus health and well-being through their cleaning and disinfection activities. They take excellent care of our classrooms, shared spaces, restrooms, laboratories, and offices through their familiarity and understanding of the specific support required for our studies, research, and work.
If you know someone who might be interested, we would truly appreciate it if you could let them know about the upcoming event and these opportunities. We look forward to hiring the next group of diverse, talented, and dedicated BSWs on the Urbana campus with your help.

        Dear Undergraduate Students,
As you begin your Winter Break, I’m writing to share important information about the Spring 2022 semester. Increases in positive COVID-19 cases, holiday travel and the emergence of the Omicron variant present real risks, and we want to maximize the safety of our community when you return to campus in a few weeks. These guidelines apply to students participating in any on-campus activities. They do not apply to fully remote students.
Spring 2022 COVID-19 Undergraduate Student Guidelines
Within three days prior to returning to campus for the Spring 2022 semester, you (even if you are fully vaccinated) will be required to receive and upload a negative off-campus COVID-19 test result to the MyMcKinley Portal.
Upon returning to campus, you (even if you are fully vaccinated) will be required to receive a negative on-campus COVID-19 test result before Friday, Jan. 21.
The off-campus test result and the on-campus test result should be at least three days apart.
In order for you to meet these requirements, the first week of the Spring 2022 semester (Jan. 18-21) will be held online. In-person instruction will resume on Monday, Jan. 24.
Despite starting the semester online, you are strongly encouraged to return to campus as planned to enable the required on-campus test and to gain building access.
We are still considering if COVID-19 vaccine boosters will be required for the Spring 2022 semester. However, we strongly recommend that during the winter break, all who are eligible receive a vaccine booster. If you have already received a booster, thank you for taking this important step.
All unvaccinated students will continue to be required to test every other day to remain in compliance.
We will hold a virtual COVID-19 Briefing Series event with more details before the Spring semester begins. We will announce that date as soon as it is finalized.
I want to give you this information now so you can prepare. We will continue to monitor the situation and seek guidance from health experts at our university, in our community, in our state and in our country. I know that everyone is tired from the toll the COVID-19 pandemic has placed on our lives. I hope you know that we do not make COVID-19 decisions lightly. At the same time, it is my responsibility to do everything I can to maximize your safety and experience at this university, and if that means additional COVID-19 restrictions because of new variants or any other developments, then we are prepared to make those decisions.
I have said from the day I became chancellor that I would lead with transparency, and I will continue to make that commitment to each of you. Thank you for all of the effort and sacrifices you have made so far to minimize the impact of COVID-19. I’m so grateful for your care for one another, and I am so proud of the COVID-19 ecosystem and community we have built here together at Illinois.

                December 20, 2021 12:38 PM
			
        Dear Faculty, Staff and Graduate Students,
Today I am sending this massmail message to all undergraduate students that shares information about Spring 2022 COVID-19 guidelines, which includes the announcement that the first week of the Spring 2022 semester will be online to allow for a return testing protocol for undergraduate students. All undergraduates will be required to submit a negative off-campus COVID-19 test result and to receive a negative on-campus COVID-19 test result before classes resume in-person on Monday, Jan. 24.
Increasing positive COVID-19 cases, holiday travel and the emergence of the Omicron variant present real risks, and we want to maximize the safety when faculty, staff and students return to campus in a few weeks. This protocol has been chosen to identify and isolate any positive COVID-19 cases in students before they return to our community. In addition to guidelines for undergraduate students, I am also putting requirements in place for all additional members of our community.
COVID-19 Guidelines for Faculty, Staff and Graduate Students
Faculty, staff and graduate students (including those who are fully vaccinated) are required to receive two negative on-campus COVID-19 test results (at least three days apart) when employees return to campus in January.
If at all possible, please complete your two negative tests prior to Jan. 15 to avoid the demands of returning students.
We are still considering if COVID-19 vaccine boosters will be required for the Spring 2022 semester. However, we strongly recommend that during the winter break, all who are eligible receive a vaccine booster. If you have already received a booster, thank you for taking this important step.
All unvaccinated employees and graduate students will continue to be required to test every other day to remain in compliance.
Graduate and professional students may receive additional information from their deans, and they should follow that guidance. 
I want to give you this information now so you can prepare. We will continue to monitor the situation and seek guidance from health experts at our university, in our community, in our state and in our country.

                December 15, 2021 10:01 AM
			
        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
Our community, like many others, has experienced a disconcerting increase in gun-related violence this year. This is a state and national trend, but there is no comfort to be found in that fact by local victims and their families, friends and neighbors.
We have a responsibility to utilize our own resources, expertise and experience to help reduce or prevent community violence.
Throughout the semester, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has been working proactively in close collaboration with Champaign, Urbana, county and state authorities to address these public safety issues. I wanted to share information about new initiatives that our university has implemented to address this violence.
We have increased our own patrol presence in campus-adjacent areas, and we have offered additional incident response coverage to our multijurisdictional partners facing staffing limitations. We are working closely with the City of Champaign and the Champaign Police Department to develop plans and identify resources that will provide even more robust and responsive patrol coverage in the spring semester.
The university will continue to partner with area police departments as part of the Champaign County Street Crimes Task Force, a multijurisdictional unit that focuses primarily on narcotics issues and gun violence.
We have added new technologies, such as license plate readers, and installed additional security cameras in key areas to deter violence and help identify offenders when crimes occur.
Our Center for Social & Behavioral Science, with NSF funding, is working with the City of Champaign to develop a new digital app that would help community members report crimes in real time and increase community engagement in violence response.
We know violence is often interconnected with inequity, so we are also leading programs to address these issues at their points of origin. Growing out of our Call to Action, we established the Campus-Community Compact to Accelerate Social Justice, which works with the cities to combat systemic racism in our community with six focus areas: accessible technology, community relations, economic development, health, wealth and resilience, inclusive education and workforce development.
We have greatly expanded our outreach, educational and support efforts to give students, faculty and staff more resources to look out for themselves and for one another.
Our REACH initiative has added licensed social workers to our response teams and empowered them— not officers— to take the lead in addressing mental health-related emergencies.
Unfortunately, there is no easy or fast solution to this crisis— whether locally, regionally or nationally. But we are pledging that our university will be a central part of the community coalition to find one as quickly as possible. Whether community groups, churches, law enforcement, city and county governments, residents of the neighborhoods most impacted or local businesses— this is a community-wide crisis and it demands a community-wide response.
Champaign-Urbana has been a partner in success for this university for more than 150 years and we will do all we can to fulfill our part of that partnership and end this crisis of gun violence.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                December 10, 2021 4:01 AM
			
        Dear UIUC Community,
I want to commend everyone for a strong finish to this challenging semester. I know this is easier said than done, but please try to find time for self-care as we approach final exams.
This letter serves as a synopsis of what Illinois Student Government (ISG) has been up to this semester and future initiatives.
Environmental Concerns
ISG President (Enoma Egiebor) and VP (Nicole Arnold) met with University of Illinois Foundation (UIF) President Jim Moore to discuss UIF operations. After reviewing the 2020 Illinois Climate Action Plan (iCAP) and discussing with President Moore, we discovered that UIF was never requested to divest from fossil fuels, despite student outcry.
My peers and I have since made numerous requests for the Chancellor's Office to rewrite their 2020 iCAP letter to President Moore. This new letter would explicitly call for fossil fuel divestment. Unfortunately, these requests have been repeatedly rejected by campus administration. Campus administration and UIF are two separate entities with close ties.
The Egiebor-Arnold Administration has a true commitment to the environment, so we are done waiting for campus administration to act. We have personally requested that President Moore form a joint effort between the UIF and the Egiebor-Arnold Administration to create a fossil fuel divestment plan.
Learn more about 2020 iCAP Key Objective: 9.1 Divest from Fossil Fuels.
Campus Climate and Inclusion
ISG is working with the Office of Inclusion and Intercultural Relations (OIIR) to acquire more campus prayer/reflection rooms.
The Committee on Campus Affairs has been working on improving mental health resources and food equity in Urbana-Champaign.
The Committee on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (CODEI) has held discussions with campus administration regarding deadnaming during the Spring '21 graduation. CODEI is closely analyzing how the deadnaming was handled and what will be done to ensure this never happens again.
CODEI is also coordinating with members of the Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) community and campus administration (specifically from the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion and OIIR) to discuss the addition of a MENA cultural house.
Campus Health
ISG is working alongside McKinley Health Center on their annual health fair, which will occur in the Spring.
The Department of Student Wellness hosted events such as a Suicide Prevention Walk alongside Gies College of Business and their affiliates, the Counseling Center, Illinois Leadership Center, and Student Affairs.
Public Outreach
The Committee on Public Relations has been increasing ISG's coordination with political outreach and advocacy groups on campus.
The committee is in communication with cultural house directors to release a Cultural House Call to Action, which publicly addresses the needs of campus cultural houses.
Student Involvement
I invite you all to our weekly senate meetings at 7:00 pm on Wednesdays in the second floor Ballroom at the Illini Union.
Our senate meetings will resume on January 19, 2022.
I hope that everyone has a restful and safe winter break. See you all in 2022!
Sincerely,
Enoma Egiebor Student Body President"

We know this semester remains challenging for you as we continue to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, and as we close the semester, you and your peers may experience added stress and anxiety.

Your peers in your classes or laboratories who show signs of panic, depression, anxiety, excessive fatigue (e.g., from academic or personal stressors or COVID-19 vaccine side effects), avoidance, confusion or who report conditions such as their ""mind goes blank,"" may need help and encouragement in seeking assistance.
If you become concerned about a friend—or yourself—the Student Assistance Center (SAC) is here to help. Staff in the SAC is available Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. Additionally, the Emergency Dean Program provides a University administrator who is on-call to assist in health or safety emergency situations that occur after business hours. To reach the SAC or the Emergency Dean, please call 217-333-0050.

We know this semester remains challenging for you and our students as we continue to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic and we would like to share some resources for support.
For our students, this semester has been more stressful than usual. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused feelings of stress and isolation. Added to the usual tensions of personal and family stress, the end of the semester can amplify stress as final examinations and deadlines for projects and papers approach.
Students in your classes or laboratories who show signs of panic, depression, anxiety, excessive fatigue (e.g., from academic or personal stressors or COVID-19 vaccine side effects), avoidance, confusion or who report conditions such as their ""mind goes blank,"" may need your help and encouragement in seeking assistance.
If you become concerned about a student, the Student Assistance Center (SAC) can help. Staff in the SAC is available Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. Additionally, the Emergency Dean Program provides a University administrator who is on-call to assist in health or safety emergency situations that occur after business hours. To reach the SAC or the Emergency Dean, please call 217-333-0050. You can find additional information about these programs at odos.illinois.edu/community-of-care.
If it is a true safety emergency, please call 911.

                December 6, 2021 11:25 AM
			
        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
Last week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) strengthened their recommendation that all adults over the age of 18 should have a COVID-19 vaccine booster. The university is strongly recommending that everyone in our university community receives a booster when they are able to do so to provide an extended level of protection.
COVID-19 Vaccine Booster
If you have not already received a COVID-19 vaccine booster, you can find appointments in the area on the CUPHD website.
If you are a student who has not received the booster because you worry reactions or side effects may impact your Finals Week, please receive a booster as soon as your exams are finished. If you are traveling home for Winter Break, you can find appointments at pharmacies in your home community on this website.
If you have already received a COVID-19 booster, thank you for doing your part to protect yourself and those around you.
If you received any of your COVID-19 vaccine shots (first dose, second dose or booster) outside the state of Illinois, you should upload your record to the MyMcKinley Portal.
If you received all your doses in the state of Illinois and you already have a verified vaccine record on file, you do not need to upload your booster record to the MyMcKinley Portal. All Illinois-based vaccines should be captured in the McKinley Medicat system within 30 days of receiving your vaccination.
In order to protect the health and well-being of our entire community, we expect everyone who is able to do so will receive a COVID-19 vaccine booster before the Spring 2022 semester.
I am proud that 94 percent of our university community is already fully vaccinated—a number far higher than our community, our state or our country. It is also higher than many other universities. Please receive a booster, so we can extend that protection.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made me so incredibly grateful to serve as your chancellor. Thank you for continuing to show patience, compassion and care for one another.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                December 6, 2021 11:05 AM
			
        Dear students, faculty and staff:
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff and the communities around us has been our priority. Your sacrifice and commitment have been instrumental in us maintaining our status as a national model for navigating the pandemic. 
As a result of your efforts, we are close to completing a safe, successful semester and beginning to plan for the spring. 
To prepare, we now ask that everyone who is eligible follow current federal, state and local health recommendations and get a COVID-19 booster shot as soon as it is recommended after your primary series (see the CDC site for details on eligibility). As with the initial vaccine rollout, each university will be issuing additional detailed guidance, so please be on the lookout for that. 
We committed from the beginning of the pandemic to follow the science and our own modeling of the pandemic and local situations, as well as other health guidance in making decisions and recommendations for our universities. Now, with data indicating that vaccine efficacy wanes and with the emergence of new variants of the virus, getting a booster shot is an important way to protect yourselves, our campuses and our communities. 
As always, we will continue to monitor advances in scientific understanding and updated guidance from public health authorities, adjusting as appropriate.
Thank you again for your vigilance and your commitment to each other. I wish you a successful finish to the semester, a joyous holiday season and a restful break. We look forward to seeing you in the spring. 
Sincerely,
Tim KilleenPresident, University of Illinois System"

        Dear campus community member,
The Urbana campus will test its emergency notification system at 10:05 a.m. on Tuesday, Dec. 7.
All campus community members are encouraged to sign up for Illini-Alert text messages to receive prompt notification of campus emergencies. You can do so by visiting http://emergency.illinois.edu. Contact information for friends and relatives may be added at http://go.illinois.edu/illinialertmyfamily. Anyone else can sign up by texting ""IlliniAlert"" to 226787.
The test of the Illini-Alert system will use all of the communication capabilities of the emergency notification system:
Email messages will be sent to all active faculty and staff members and students with campus email addresses.
Text messages will be sent to those people who have registered their cellphone numbers.  
A message will be sent to the Illini-Alert Twitter account (http://twitter.com/illinialert).
A message will appear on all digital signs connected to the Illini-Alert system.
The test does not require any response; evaluators will be able to monitor the speed and distribution rates of the messaging. Thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely,
Sherry Wooten

                December 2, 2021 10:02 AM
			
        Dear Faculty, Staff & Students,  
As a next step in our COVID-19 response, the university will be transitioning to the Illinois App as the primary way for faculty, staff and students to display their COVID-19 Building Access Status. This operational shift is intended to keep the most-used feature of the Safer Illinois app while making it easier for students (using one app instead of several) and more efficient for university operations. We’re hopeful this shift will also provide better support and customer service for our faculty, staff and students if they encounter any issues or questions.
If you already have the Illinois App:
The new Building Access Status element is ready to use.
See more information about the new feature on the Illinois App website.
If you do not already have the Illinois App:
We encourage you to download it from the App Store (for iPhone users) or Google Play (for Android users) before the Spring semester.
See more information about how to use the Illinois App and learn about its additional features on the Illinois App website:
Athletics info (schedules, scores, news)
Events (by topic, by proximity, by date)
Wallet (Illini Cash, Illini ID, MTD bus pass)
Quick Polls (post questions to people near you)
Campus Guide (quick links to popular resources)
Groups (post announcements, host chats, publish events in the app)

The COVID-19 Boarding Pass will continue to be an alternate way faculty, staff and students can display their Building Access Status. The Safer Illinois app will continue to be operational, but we do plan to move away from it sometime during the Spring semester, and we will notify the university community before doing so. If you have any questions or concerns about building access procedures, please visit the Building Access page on the COVID-19 website or email covid-19@illinois.edu.
As we continue this next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, I sincerely appreciate your understanding as we make changes to our university response to best serve our university community. I am grateful for your continued patience and support.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear colleagues:
We are pleased to announce that, this year, an additional paid day off will be added to the December/January year-end calendar. The additional paid time off is part of our ongoing efforts to show how much we appreciate your hard work, resiliency, sacrifice and commitment – qualities that have shone brightly throughout the COVID-19 crisis. In the face of extraordinary challenges, both on the job and at home, you have come together to not only pull the University of Illinois System through the historic storm but to make it a model for the nation.
Employees who are eligible for leave benefits will receive an additional paid gift day on Tuesday, Jan. 4, 2022. This addition will amend this year’s Reduced Service Days to be Dec. 29, 30 and 31, 2021 and Jan. 4, 2022. Combined with holidays, other paid time off and weekends, this will extend the year-end break from Friday, Dec. 24, 2021 through Tuesday, Jan. 4, 2022.
For employees in union-represented bargaining units, paid time off for the holidays is addressed through the required collective bargaining process.
Thank you for helping sustain our more-than-150-year legacy of excellence. We hope you are able to have some much-deserved time with family and friends over the next two months.

Our partners at the Illini Union Bookstore have determined that although they were due Oct. 7, only about 30 percent of course materials have been shared with them so far. There are concerns that supply chain, staffing and trucking issues may pose challenges to receiving instructional materials for this upcoming semester.
Please submit your materials as soon as possible (even if you are using your own materials), so we can ensure they are available for students at the beginning of the Spring 2022 semester:

        Dear Faculty and Staff,
I am pleased to announce the opening of the request for proposals for the 2022-23 Call to Action to Address Racism & Social Injustice Research Program. This program is a $2 million investment by our university to fund competitively awarded grants that enhance our exceptional cross-disciplinary scholarly strengths and expand community collaborations to build cultures of research and engagement that address structures of racism and injustice.
The full RFP along with the application details can be found here. For 2022, the focus of the research areas and funding tracks remain the same as last year:
Systemic racism and social justice
Law enforcement and criminal justice reform
Disparities in health and health care
This year the maximum award amount is $75,000, which will allow us to fund a greater percentage of the proposals received. Proposals can be submitted along three different funding tracks, each with a maximum award level:
Community-Based Innovation projects (up to $25,000)
Systemic Institutional Change projects (up to $75,000)
Societal Impact projects (up to $75,000)
To begin the competitive process, a brief pre-proposal describing the proposed project, the objectives and how it connects to the broader Call to Action goals is due by December 3, 2021. Projects selected to move to the full proposal stage will be invited to do so with a deadline of March 4, 2022.
Tenure-stream or specialized faculty (instructors and lecturers), or an Academic Professional with appointments (0 to 100%) in any Urbana-Champaign university unit are eligible to apply.
We will be holding an online, public information session about this year’s program and the proposal submission process on November 10 at 4 pm. Registration is required. For more information and to register for the information session, visit go.illinois.edu/AddressingRacism.
The Call to Action to Address Racism and Social Injustice Research Program is an important step forward as we continue the work needed to transform the way our own university supports, prioritizes, and recognizes the research of scholars working on issues of systemic racism and bias in the United States.
I hope that you will consider attending the information session, and I encourage you to look to others across this university and around our entire community to join you in submitting a proposal for this year’s round of funding.
Sincerely,
Sean C. GarrickVice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion"

        Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,
In July 2020 I announced the creation of the Call to Action Research Program to Address Racism and Social Injustice, a $2 million annual commitment by our university to respond to the critical need for universities across our nation to prioritize research focused on systemic racial inequities and injustices, as well as the expansion of community-based knowledge that advances the understanding of systemic racism and generationally embedded racial disparity.
Today, I am pleased to announce the recipients for this first year of Call to Action funding. To read the list of this year’s projects is to begin to appreciate the full array of talent, creativity and commitment to use the power of research to transform lives and create an equitable and just world. A full list of projects and descriptions are available on the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion website.
From the arts and public engagement to work on data equity, perinatal, youth and family programs, college access and success, racial equity in the legal system and language justice, the awarded proposals each have the potential to make immediate change in our community and represent the heart of our land-grant mission and the very best of who we are as a university.
In total, 22 projects were funded from the 91 pre-proposals submitted in three research focus areas: systemic racism and social justice; law enforcement and criminal justice reform; disparities in health and health care. These projects represent eight colleges and 17 departments and administrative units, with 70 percent of funded proposals collaborating with almost 20 different organizations in our communities. Awards this year range from $10,000 to $100,000 and span the breadth of our research enterprise.
Congratulations to each project leader and community partner. The research groups will share their work with the campus community at a research symposium in Fall 2022.
Even though much of the world’s attention has been necessarily turned to the continuing devastation of the current pandemic, there is no diminishing of the urgency for the solutions our university is uniquely positioned to deliver around systemic racism and embedded racial disparity in our society. I encourage you to explore these first Call to Action projects.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear undergraduate students,  
In the past several days, the SHIELD team has identified an increase in positive cases among undergraduate students, including those who are fully vaccinated. In light of this and the upcoming Halloween weekend, I would like to remind you that we have one of the safest COVID-19 ecosystems in the country that you can use to maximize your safety and the safety of others in our community.  
If your plans include travel or participating in Halloween or other activities we recommend you: 
Take a COVID-19 test at an on-campus testing site as soon as possible and then test a few times in the next several days, even if you are fully vaccinated. 
Please follow COVID-19 safety guidelines and/or recommendations such as wearing face coverings indoors and testing after traveling. 
Thank you for your continued patience, understanding and care for one another. If we are diligent, together, we can minimize spread and continue to enjoy all that an on-campus experience has to offer.  
I wish you all a fun and safe upcoming weekend.  
Sincerely, 
Robert J. Jones Chancellor"

                October 26, 2021 10:02 AM
			
        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
I have been so thankful and inspired by your actions to maximize safety for our entire community this semester. Your decisions to get vaccinated for COVID-19 and to maintain testing schedules have meant that we’ve been able to enjoy this semester on campus together.
I’m also grateful to our local Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) and our own SHIELD team for their continual partnership and science-based recommendations for our community. I’m writing to share additional measures they recommend we all take before and after Fall Break to keep ourselves, our friends and our families safe. As a reminder, all Fall 2021 in-person courses will remain in-person after Fall Break.
COVID-19 recommendations for before and after Fall Break
 Receive a COVID-19 vaccine booster as soon as you are eligible.
According to the CDC, studies have shown that COVID-19 vaccine protection may decrease over time. Data show booster shots can increase the immune response in individuals who have been vaccinated for at least six months, which provides increased protection.
CUPHD is offering booster clinics for those who are eligible. If you are not yet eligible, please continue to check your university email frequently. We will share opportunities for additional groups when they become eligible.

 Test before and after Fall Break if you are planning to travel.
The CDC says travel can increase your chance of getting and spreading COVID-19. We recommend everyone (even those who are fully vaccinated) utilize our on-campus COVID-19 test sites to take a test before and after you travel, especially if you are planning to be around anyone who is not fully vaccinated or in a high-risk category.
If you are not yet fully vaccinated, you will be required to take an on-campus COVID-19 test on Saturday, Nov. 27 or Sunday, Nov. 28 in order to have building access on Monday, Nov. 29. As a reminder, employees are not required to test on their day off. They should test on their first day back.
On-campus testing sites will be closed on Thursday, Nov. 25 and Friday, Nov. 26 but will have expanded hours until 6 p.m. on Sunday, Nov. 28.

 Get your flu shot. 
Protect yourself and others by getting a flu shot at an on-campus walk-in flu clinic.
The CDC says flu shots can reduce the risk of flu-associated hospitalization, leaving capacity for patients who may need to be hospitalized due to COVID-19.

As always, we will continue to monitor any spread of COVID-19 on campus and adjust our response as necessary to maximize safety. Thank you again for your continued patience, care and understanding. I wish you all a productive few weeks until you are able to take a well-deserved break.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        I am delighted to forward information for the 2021-2022 Chancellor's Academic Professional Excellence (CAPE) Award.
The CAPE Award allows me and the University to honor academic professionals (AP) who demonstrate excellence in work, personal and professional contributions. Academic professionals perform a wide range of critical functions for our campus community and beyond. They advise, counsel, and assist our students, faculty, and staff; provide critical administrative services; support our research laboratories and educational programs; and offer important outreach programs throughout the state.
Six awards are given annually and nominees are evaluated on three criteria highlighting work, personal, and professional contributions. Each winner of the CAPE Award will be honored at a reception, where they will receive a $1,000 award and a commemorative plaque.
This is an opportunity for us to honor those academic professionals who contribute so much to our campus, and I urge you to take the time to nominate academic professionals for the CAPE Award. Full-time academic professionals with at least three years of full-time Academic Professional service at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign are eligible. 
The deadline for submitting nominations on the CAPE nomination website, http://go.illinois.edu/capenomination, is Monday, December 20, 2021 at 5:00 p.m. If you have any questions, please contact Deb Stone, Interim Senior Associate Chancellor for Human Resources at debstone@illinois.edu.
Thank you for your continued support of academic professionals and your willingness to help honor their accomplishments.

        Dear Colleagues,
A cross-disciplinary team of faculty and staff from marketing, communications and technology teams across our campus has been working to create a new set of free templates, tools and resources to help colleges, departments and units build and maintain engaging, useful and accessible websites that also meet our brand standards.  
There are a number of new web design patterns and components and themes available for immediate campus use, including those compatible with the most popular campus platforms. You can take advantage of their work by visiting the Illinois Web Theme, which features information, resources and contacts for getting involved and staying involved in this important work. It is important to note one of the foundational priorities of this project was to build out these resources to make them useable at every level of web development and design expertise–from beginner to expert.
I want to offer my appreciation to the members of the Web Implementation Guidelines Group (WIGG), who came together on a voluntary basis to help us find easier, cheaper solutions that deliver more consistency in our branding and messaging platforms.   
Their innovation and drive will do more than facilitate a stronger, more consistent web presence across the university. It will save our units time and money. Working with outside vendors to create properly branded websites can be labor intensive and costly, and it puts units with fewer resources at a disadvantage. WIGG’s new templates and tools are free and can be implemented immediately for campus website creation or redesign projects.  
These past two years have demonstrated just how important our web and digital spaces are to our ability to deliver on every phase of our land-grant university missions. These sites and resources are the first point of engagement for many who join the Illinois family, but they have also become the virtual foundations for our educational, outreach and research enterprises. Thanks to the very hard and very thoughtful work of WIGG in these past months, we have an important new set of tools to help us tell our stories and to put the world-changing power of Illinois innovation in the hands of those who need it most.   
I encourage you to explore your website options, join the community building upon this foundation and communicate with the teams that can implement them.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Greetings and Happy Campus Sustainability Day!
As campuses across the globe mark this day, the Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment (iSEE) is pleased and proud to offer new “best practices” videos for all to help us make the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign a model of sustainability.
Our campus takes sustainability very seriously. And for very good reason: As part of our responsibility to uphold the relationship that exists between Native peoples and these lands, we must embrace the climate commitments we’ve made and the values in which that relationship is rooted. Our Illinois Climate Action Plan is a roadmap to sustainability, and iSEE’s new training videos offer specific actions that we can all take, whether students, faculty/researchers, or staff and administrators.
Please visit https://go.illinois.edu/sust_training to watch a short video, then fill out a brief survey. This survey gives you a chance to weigh in on the climate action priorities that will help our campus reach carbon neutrality. And all who fill it out will be entered into a sustainability raffle!
Our webpage also features helpful resources mentioned in the video; you can use them to learn about initiative, groups, and facilities on our campus already making a difference, and you can find out how to partake in these positive actions.
Finally, please join iSEE and Facilities & Services at today’s Campus Sustainability Celebration, from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. in the NCSA lobby and atrium. This event is in appreciation of all the hard work done by our community. It also serves as a chance to look back at our accomplishments — and ahead to the challenges that remain.

        Dear Colleagues,
As you are aware, the university is requiring all faculty and staff to be fully vaccinated by October 19. To help our employees meet this requirement, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) are conducting two (2) on-campus COVID-19 vaccination clinics that will be open to all employees next Tuesday, October 19. Employees do not need to utilize benefit time to visit these clinics and receive a vaccination.

IDPH Vaccination Clinic
Facilities and Services1501 South Oak Street, Champaign7 a.m. to 4 p.m.
It is anticipated that Johnson and Johnson, Moderna, and Pfizer vaccines will be available. These clinics are intended to provide the second dose for employees who received the first dose of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine at the September 29 clinic, however all employees are welcome to attend. Boosters for the Pfizer vaccine will also be available for those who qualify. The Johnson and Johnson vaccine requires a single dose to be fully vaccinated.
All faculty and staff who are not able to receive the vaccine for medical or religious reasons must request an exemption through the ADA Division for the Office for Access and Equity by filling out the request form and submitting any relevant documentation: ADA Division Online Employee Accommodation Request Form.
We are hopeful these on-campus clinics will allow for more convenient access to the vaccines. Thank you for doing your part to maximize the safety of our entire community. If you have questions, please contact ihr-ler@mx.uillinois.edu.

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
Academic freedom and free speech are the bedrock of both democracy and of this university. Rigorous debate and fearless intellect have pioneered the novel ideas and discoveries that earned the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign its global reputation for excellence.
Universities and the communities in which we live, study and work are becoming more prominent focal points for intense debate around many of the most divisive and most contentious matters in our global society. This is not a point of alarm. It is, in fact, a reaffirmation of our mission. We can find ready examples across the nation and on our own campus of causes across the entire spectrum of political, religious and social issues. We saw this recently at a protest by several student groups about the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
However, with regularity in our society today, we are seeing more instances where disagreement, debate and protests around divisive and difficult issues employ rhetoric, language and actions that invite and provoke violence and damage. These tactics constitute a betrayal, not a vindication, of the bedrock purposes of academic freedom and free speech.
We can and should feel free to dispute, debate and challenge ideas and opinions as we choose. But we must help our community learn to do so in ways that preserve human dignity and recognize the lived experiences of others.
Disagreement and respect for those who disagree with us are not incompatible. But calls for violence or harm toward others under the guise of expression of free speech are antithetical to our values. We will always condemn actions that target our students, faculty, staff or other members of our community. Words matter and those that incite violence will never be acceptable here at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. 
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                October 12, 2021 10:02 AM
			
        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
As you know, all faculty, staff and students (except those who are fully remote and never come to campus or university-affiliated buildings) who are able to do so are required to be fully vaccinated (two weeks after final dose) by Oct. 15. Thank you to the overwhelming majority of you who have been fully vaccinated or who have received an exemption from vaccination. With more than 91% of our campus community fully vaccinated and others in the process of completing the vaccination series, we have made great strides in our ability to stay together this academic year.
Based on guidance from our SHIELD team, the university is updating testing guidance beginning on Oct. 16:
If you are fully vaccinated with a university-verified record in the MyMcKinley Portal, you are not required to participate in the testing program.The only exception is if you receive a notification that you are in a location or group with increased cases and need to test every other day for a period of time.

If you are not fully vaccinated and you have an approved medical or religious vaccination exemption, you are required to test and receive negative results every other day.
If you are not fully vaccinated with a university-verified record and you do not have an approved medical or religious vaccination exemption, you are required to test and receive negative results every other day until you are fully vaccinated.
Employees who are required to test are not required to test on their non-work days or on remote days, if working a hybrid remote schedule.
Employees working at remote, off-site university facilities should follow the established testing frequencies at their location.

These SHIELD recommendations are rooted in science and data with the goal to maximize safety for our entire community. The SHIELD team has advised that testing unvaccinated individuals twice per week is not enough to be confident in our ability to maximize their safety and that requiring testing every day is not necessary.
These updated testing frequencies will display in the Safer Illinois app and the Boarding Pass starting Monday, Oct. 18, and we will be using these testing frequencies to enforce compliance through digital monitoring.
Individuals who miss a test will receive reminder emails and text messages. Those who do not return to testing compliance will be subject to existing progressive discipline processes, which may result in the loss of employment or dismissal from school. For undergraduate students, after multiple missed tests, the university may also restrict access to certain technologies (including Canvas, Compass, Kaltura and others).
Individuals who witness unsafe COVID-19 behavior by a student or employee may submit their experiences here: http://go.illinois.edu/COVID19-report. These reports are reviewed by Student Affairs and Illinois Human Resources.
Thank you for your patience and understanding as we navigate this next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Together, we can continue to show the world how to navigate this pandemic through innovation, collaboration and kindness.

MTD has reduced bus service because of staffing shortages. Campus hopper routes will remain unchanged, but passengers may experience increased wait times with fewer shuttles operating. Also, many routes and connections that individuals regularly use to reach the general campus area have been adjusted or rescheduled.
Before making a trip, please check the updated schedules on the MTD website, which uses real-time tracking data. You can also sign up for custom alerts once logged in to your MTD account.
MTD is making every effort to preserve as much service coverage as possible while addressing the need for more operators. The nationwide labor shortage continues to present significant challenges for many industries, including public transportation.

                October 7, 2021 8:01 AM
			
        Dear campus community member,
In order to maintain an effective emergency response and evacuation plan, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign recently completed a test including two components: a drill and an exercise. The test was designed to challenge our emergency response procedures and how we notify you of a threat to our campus community. We are informing you of these efforts so you have more information about our plans to protect you in the event of an emergency, and to comply with disclosure mandates set forth in the federal Clery Act.
On Sept. 7, we initiated a test of our Illini-Alert emergency notification system. The drill was announced ahead of time by a mass email to campus and an Eweek notification to faculty and staff. The Illini-Alert system sent an email to the campus email addresses of all active students, faculty and staff. Those who have registered alternate email addresses also received a notification. Those who have registered a cellphone number received a text message during this drill.
Illini-Alert messages are also posted to Twitter and digital signage throughout campus buildings. This approach increases the speed and breadth of our distribution of emergency notifications, and it provides alternate notification methods that will continue to function even if one system fails to work properly.
For the second component, university stakeholders and emergency responders gathered virtually on Sept. 21 for a tabletop exercise. Those involved were presented with a scenario involving a train derailment with a subsequent fire and hazardous material spill directly affecting the campus. The exercise tested various components of the Campus Emergency Operations Plan, including evacuation procedures.
This test was conducted to ensure we have a robust response plan in the event of a campus emergency, and that our notifications will reach you in a timely and effective manner. If you have not signed up to receive Illini-Alert text messages, please visit emergency.illinois.edu to register.
To view the university’s emergency response and evacuation procedures, please visit go.illinois.edu/EmergencyResponse.
The Division of Public Safety is committed to maintaining a safe and secure campus environment where education, research and public service can flourish. We can only do so with the assistance of our community, and we hope this information is useful to our campus partners.

        Dear Students,
Beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 13, undergraduate students who are out of compliance for COVID-19 testing will lose access to certain university technologies. These technologies include Compass, Canvas and others. See the full list here.
This only applies to students who are required to participate in on-campus testing, which includes all students who are not fully vaccinated with a verified record and those who are fully vaccinated who have been asked to test temporarily due to an increase in cases at their residence.
You will be notified via email before your technology is restricted. Your access to university email, campus Wi-Fi, and health and safety services will not be affected.
If you are out of compliance, please visit one of our on-campus testing sites as soon as possible and take an on-campus COVID-19 saliva test to get back into compliance. 
After you take an on-campus COVID-19 test, you will regain access to these technologies, but it may take up to four hours for that to be reflected in your Safer Illinois app.
Noncompliance with the testing requirement may also result in referral to the Office for Student Conflict Resolution for formal disciplinary action up to, and including, dismissal.
For questions or concerns, please email covidwellness@illinois.edu.

        Hello students,
The Student Sustainability Committee (SSC) is a student-led organization that funds student, staff, and faculty project proposals via two student fees—the Cleaner Energy Technologies Fee and the Sustainable Campus Environment Fee—which together make up the Illinois Green Fund. Projects selected for funding are those which provide the greatest benefit to sustainability on campus, while providing engaging, educational opportunities for students to learn more about sustainability. The SSC is accepting project applications now! 
Additionally, the SSC is introducing a new program to guide students from a broad interest in sustainability to a fully-fledged project application. By supporting applicants step-by-step through our process, we hope to engage students on a larger scale, ultimately resulting in the strongest applications possible. This new Project Funding Workshop Series will span five sessions, which can be found on the SSC calendar. Our first meeting will be held this Wednesday, September 29th, from 4-5 pm CT, in Lincoln Hall, Room 1065. We will discuss issues related to sustainability on campus that could be addressed with an SSC-funded project. In subsequent sessions, we will develop solutions to these challenges, create project proposals, and help participants write funding applications.
For anyone who is passionate about sustainability and the environment, this is a great opportunity to turn your passion into a tangible, positive change for the campus community! Presently, we are not offering this event online. If you are unable to attend in-person, but still would like to get involved with the SSC, you can stay up-to-date by signing up for our mailing list. If you are interested in becoming a General Member, or other aspects of the committee, please visit our website. Every student at the University pays approximately $14 a semester to the Illinois Green Fund, so please join us to help allocate these student dollars!
October is Campus Sustainability Month! We encourage you to attend UIUC’s inaugural Student Sustainability Summit this October, co-hosted with the Student Sustainability Leadership Council (SSLC). This month-long program includes University- and community-led sustainability efforts through events such as Green Quad Day, a Sustainability Research Symposium, teach-ins, tours of campus facilities, a movie night, and much more! To learn about the full breadth of the summit and stay updated on other sustainability-related RSOs, add the SSLC’s calendar. You can also connect with our social media accounts @ssc_uiuc and @uiuc_sslc on both Twitter and Instagram! Finally, for more information on campus sustainability efforts and events, check out the iCAP (Illinois Climate Action Plan) Portal and iSEE (Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment) Calendar.
We hope to see you at the Project Funding Workshop Series, Student Sustainability Summit, and more events throughout Campus Sustainability Month and beyond!Best,

        Dear Colleagues,
On behalf of our students, thank you for your commitment and contributions to re-engaging them in the richness and unmatched benefits of the residential university experience this semester. Looking to the spring semester, we must double down on this commitment. The past year and a half, we routinely heard that students want more in-person instruction and more opportunities for in-person discussion sessions, collaborations and engagement with instructors and peers alike to advance their learning and educational development. When our students made the decision to attend the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign this year, they did so with the expectation of increased in-person experiences. We owe it to them, and we are prepared to deliver on their expectations. 
The University has been working diligently ensuring that we are maximizing safety in our on-campus environment for students, faculty and staff. Our health and safety measures reflect the most current guidance from the CDC, IDPH, CUPHD and the SHEILD team: a face covering requirement for indoor university facilities; a thorough review of and standards for ventilation that meet the CDC’s COVID-19 recommendations for ventilation/HVAC systems for instructional spaces on campus; implementation of vaccine requirements for students, faculty and staff with one of the highest community vaccination rates in the state; and all of the above augmented with a proven, robust, effective PCR testing ecosystem. Our SHIELD team has found that our in-person classes are among the safest places in the community. There has been no evidence of spread of COVID-19 in the classroom.
As we plan for spring, our expectation is that courses that can be offered in-person will be offered in-person and will remain in this delivery modality. Instructors who wish to change modality must request and receive approval from the department and college to do so. As part of that process, the instructor will need to describe the unique circumstances around the request and discuss them with the unit executive officer. Instructors with health issues that prevent them from being in the classroom may seek an accommodation through an ADA process.
We have all worked so hard to make our campus as safe as possible. The university monitors health and safety conditions very closely, we are cognizant of the choices made by local school districts, and in the event conditions deteriorate, we will modify our approach.
We recognize we are all here because of and for our students. All of us together will deliver to them the educational experiences they expect and need to become the leaders and innovators of tomorrow.

I am pleased to announce that Dr. Beverly Bunch has agreed to chair the committee that will advise Interim Executive Vice President Avijit Ghosh and me in the search for the next permanent chancellor of the University of Illinois Springfield.
Dr. Bunch brings 20 years of experience as a teacher, researcher and administrator at UIS. A well-known scholar on budgeting and financial management in state and local government, she is a professor in the School of Public Management and Policy and the Center for State Policy and Leadership. She is the winner of the UIS Star Faculty/Staff Award, UIS Spencer Faculty Service Award and UIS Faculty Excellence Award.
She previously taught at the Universities of Texas at Austin and at San Antonio and worked for the Government Finance Officers Association, the City of San Antonio budget office and the Texas Bond Review Board. She currently is leading a team of researchers as part of a national project on state budgets administered by the Volcker Alliance.
I am grateful to her for sharing her time and talents as the chair of the advisory committee. I look forward to working with her and the advisory committee that will be announced shortly. We will provide periodic updates on the search to the campus community, including opportunities to provide input to the committee. Information will also be provided on a website to be launched soon.

        Dear Colleagues,
As you are aware, the university is requiring all faculty and staff to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19. To help our employees meet this requirement, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) are conducting two (2) on-campus COVID-19 vaccination clinics that are open to all employees next Tuesday, Sept. 28. Employees do not need to utilize benefit time to visit these clinics and receive a vaccination.

IDPH Vaccination ClinicFacilities and Services1501 South Oak Street, Champaign7 a.m. to 4 p.m.
It is anticipated that both Johnson and Johnson and Pfizer vaccines will be available. At the time of the first dose, a follow up appointment for the second dose will be given. Those follow up appointments will be scheduled for October 19, 2021.
All faculty and staff who are not able to receive the vaccine for medical or religious reasons must request an exemption through the ADA Division of the Office for Access and Equity by filling out the request form and submitting any relevant documentation: ADA Division Online Employee Accommodation Request Form.
We are hopeful these on-campus clinics will allow for more convenient access to the vaccines. Thank you for doing your part to maximize the safety of our entire community. If you have questions, please contact ihr-ler@illinois.edu.

        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
I am pleased to announce that Professor Germán Bollero will serve as the interim dean of the College of ACES pending approval by the Board of Trustees. He will hold the title interim dean designate until formal approval by the board. Professor Bollero’s selection comes after consultation with members of the College Executive Committee, senior academic leaders and faculty of the College.
Professor Bollero has been a member of the faculty at Illinois since 1998, with a tenured home in the Department of Crop Sciences. Thanks to his seasoned experience in various leadership roles and a strong record of dedicated service to ACES, Professor Bollero will provide the stability and the leadership to allow the college to continue moving forward during this transition. The excellence of his scholarship, his commitment to the convergent research culture of Illinois and the respect he has earned across our entire campus made him a clear choice to serve in this critical role.
I anticipate launching a national search for the permanent dean of ACES later this semester. In the weeks ahead, I will consult with the ACES Executive Committee and College leadership about forming the search committee, and I will share that information when it is finalized.
I want to thank Dean Kidwell for her leadership of ACES and to particularly recognize her for her efforts in helping the ACES faculty, staff and students navigate the unprecedented challenges COVID-19 has brought with it.
Please join me in welcoming, Professor Bollero as the interim dean designate of ACES. I am confident he will have the full support of his colleagues and that ACES will continue under his leadership to advance in its academic and scholarly missions with the optimism and confidence the world has come to expect from our first and oldest college at Illinois.

        Dear Colleagues,
I am pleased to announce the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign 2021 Campus Charitable Fund Drive (CCFD), our annual workplace giving campaign, which will take place from Sept. 22 through Nov. 17.
As we continue to navigate the impacts of COVID-19, this campaign is an opportunity to support our communities at home and around the world. For eight weeks, university employees can safely and easily support the charities of their choice to make a positive impact on the lives of many. I encourage you to explore the CCFD website to learn more about our campaign and the causes that are important to you. Giving can be a one-time gift or an ongoing payroll deduction.
Since the start of the pandemic, this entire university has shown the world what happens when the Illinois family comes together. Last year, after transitioning to a virtual space, we were able to raise over $1.3 million to help others in our local community and beyond. This year, our goal is to raise $1.5 million to benefit those in need.
I especially want to thank our Illinois faculty members and staff volunteers who serve as unit leaders to help make CCFD possible. They play an invaluable role in coordinating the efforts of the campaign. If you have any questions about CCFD, I encourage you to reach out to your college or department unit leader.
I am grateful for your thoughtful consideration during this campaign. Together, we can make a tremendous difference in the lives of others.

        Dear Students and Employees,
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug Free Workplace Act and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act require the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:
http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/
The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.
Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to marijuana in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s marijuana prohibition.
The university’s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.
The university’s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.
Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. University employees should contact Illinois Human Resources at (217) 333-2137.

Dr. Danita M. Brown YoungVice Chancellor for Student Affairs"

        Dear Members of the University Community, 
At the beginning of every academic year, I write to you to reaffirm our university’s commitment to equal opportunity, affirmative action and equal access. This commitment to create and maintain an equitable and just campus community is essential to upholding the most fundamental principles of academic freedom, equity and human dignity, which are core to the mission of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Our university is committed to creating a campus community in which each person knows that their talents, perspectives, life experiences and faith traditions are respected and valued. We are also committed to using our intellectual and scholarly power to address structural and systemic biases and social disparities in our community, nation and world.  
University policies prohibit discrimination and harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, disability, national origin, citizenship status, ancestry, age, order of protection status, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, arrest record status, unfavorable discharge from the military and status as a protected veteran. These protections extend to all members of the campus community during any stage of the employment process, including but not limited to, recruitment, selection, promotion, transfer, merit increases, salary, training and development, demotion and separation. Similarly, the university prohibits discrimination in admissions, enrollment, and provision of services, programs, and activities. 
As a part of our affirmative action plan, consistent with state and federal laws, we undertake good faith efforts to increase the representation of women, minorities, individuals with disabilities, and veterans among our faculty and staff. An affirmative action plan is essential to furthering equal employment opportunity and diversity on our campus and to fulfilling our affirmative action obligations. 
The Office for Access & Equity is available to assist any employees who have concerns about discrimination, harassment or retaliation. You can submit a discrimination or harassment claim through the university’s online reporting portal (accessible claim form). To learn more about OAE’s broader services related to equity, affirmative action and disability-related matters, please see the Office for Access & Equity website. You can also review the nondiscrimination policy and sexual misconduct policy and procedures for addressing Title IX sexual harassment complaints online. Retaliation against any person for exercising their rights under these policies is strictly prohibited.  
The ADA Division of the Office for Access and Equity facilitates disability, religious and pregnancy/parenting accommodations for all faculty, staff, undergraduate and graduate student employees, as well as job applicants. The ADA Division engages in an interactive process to determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation for each person. The division also provides advice, consultation and educational programming to increase awareness and inclusion of individuals with disabilities. To request a reasonable accommodation, employees can complete the online employee accommodation request form.
Students can learn more about the student academic supports and accommodations services that may be available to them by contacting the Division of Disability Resources & Educational Services. Students also have the right to request accommodations for religious observances and can learn more from the Office of the Dean of Students.
We recently shared an update regarding Title IX and our commitment to prevent and respond to sexual misconduct. Please visit the We Care website to learn more about confidential and non-confidential resources, university policies, disciplinary procedures, rights and options and additional information related to the prevention, reporting, and response to sexual misconduct. Questions regarding Title IX may also be sent to the U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights.  
Creating an inclusive and equitable campus requires that we annually reaffirm our individual and collective commitments. Only together can we build a university community that is truly diverse, welcoming and inclusive of students, scholars and staff.

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
As we begin a new academic year, I write to share with you information about the offices, policies and resources available on our campus to help prevent and respond to sexual harassment and misconduct. The University of Illinois believes that each member of our university community should expect to learn and work in a community that prioritizes care, dignity and mutual respect. This expectation includes our responsibility to create a campus community that is free of harassment and discrimination based on sex, including gender discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and sexual violence. University policy prohibits discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation and gender identity, consistent with the Department of Education’s interpretation of discrimination based on sex.
Danielle Morrison, our university’s Title IX Coordinator, provides oversight and support for the university’s comprehensive Title IX programs and initiatives. Dr. Morrison can be reached at titleixcoordinator@illinois.edu or (844) 616-7978. You may also visit the Title IX Office for more information about ways the office can assist.
A full description of the Sexual Misconduct policy, process and information about reporting obligations, as well as the provision of confidential advisors under Title IX, is maintained centrally on the We Care: Sexual Misconduct Support, Response, and Prevention website. All students, faculty and staff are asked to review the University of Illinois System Statement on Sex Discrimination, Sexual Harassment and Other Sexual Misconduct, which is also located on the We Care site. The Sexual Misconduct Policy in the Campus Administrative Manual and Student Code includes other prohibited sexual misconduct in addition to Title IX Sexual Harassment.
If you experience sexual misconduct – including sexual harassment, sexual assault, and other forms of sexual violence – know that you are not alone and support is available. On our campus, there are several confidential resources, including the Counseling Center, McKinley Health Center and the Women’s Resources Center (WRC). The WRC has Confidential Advisors, who are staff members specifically trained to provide support and advocacy. The We Care site has additional information about campus resources and answers to frequently asked questions about reporting options.
Sexual misconduct in any form violates our institutional values. It is the responsibility of each one of us to stand up against harmful behavior in our community. I encourage you to take a few moments to learn more about these campus resources, so that together we can continue to create a university that supports and values the success and well-being of all.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

As you know, on Aug. 26, Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced a mandate that all university students must be vaccinated against COVID-19. After this announcement, I sent this email message to the university community reiterating our university rules and processes following the governor’s new executive order. I’m writing to clarify our expectations:
All students (except those who are fully remote and never come to campus) are required to receive a first dose of a university-accepted COVID-19 vaccine by Sept. 15. Get vaccinated at CRCE by making an appointment in your MyMcKinley Portal or find a nearby appointment at vaccines.gov and get vaccinated today.
If you have not already done so, you are required to receive a final dose and submit your Vaccination Record Card to the MyMcKinley Portal by Oct. 15. You should submit as soon as you receive your final dose.
All students who are not able to receive the vaccine for medical or religious reasons must request an exemption and submit any relevant documentation by Sept. 15:
To request a medical exemption, submit through the MyMcKinley Portal. 
To request a religious exemption: Fill out this form and email it to helpdean@illinois.edu. 
You will receive an interim exemption while your submission is being reviewed.
All students who are granted an interim or ongoing exemption will be required to continue the on-campus testing program, currently set at every other day for undergraduates and twice per week for graduate students.

The Governor’s executive order sets minimum testing expectations for those who are unvaccinated. From the beginning of this pandemic, the university has made clear that our top priority is to maximize safety for our entire community. Aligned with this strategy, after Oct. 15, all students who do not have a Vaccination Record Card OR an exemption on file will be required to take an on-campus COVID-19 test every day until they are fully vaccinated.
This policy is enforceable through existing progressive discipline processes, which may result in dismissal.
Individuals who are not able to be vaccinated and are not able to participate in the on-campus testing program cannot be on campus or at a university-affiliated location off campus and must be fully remote.
Thank you for doing your part to maximize the safety of our entire community.

President honors leaders of COVID-19 lab developmentPresidential Medallions given to innovators behind SHIELD mobile labs 
CHAMPAIGN, Ill. – University of Illinois System President Tim Killeen on Friday honored two people who are among the primary leadership behind the system’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, presenting them with the Presidential Medallion. The medallion is the highest honor the system president can bestow.
Abigail Wooldridge, an assistant professor in the Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and Harley T. Johnson, associate dean for research in UIUC’s Grainger College of Engineering and a professor in its Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, were recognized for their key roles in the development of a prototype laboratory to process COVID-19 tests as part of the SHIELD test-and-trace system developed at UIUC and mobile labs now deployed around the country by Shield T3, a system-related organization created to provide the tests outside Illinois.
Wooldridge and Johnson join 28 others who have been awarded Presidential Medallions for their leadership in the system’s pandemic response. 
Killeen, who recognized Wooldridge and Johnson during a leadership retreat at the I Hotel on the UIUC campus, called the work that created the labs indispensable.
“The SHIELD test is crucial to our ability to keep our universities open and now to protect many thousands of people beyond those campuses. Without the fast, accurate results provided by these labs, none of this would be possible,” Killeen said. “The efforts of these leaders and thousands of their colleagues across the U of I System remain a source of great pride for me and for the system. Their ingenuity, dedication and hard work continue to demonstrate in real time the impact that the system and its three universities create for Illinois and its people.”
Killeen honored 28 other individuals on Monday for their roles in SHIELD, SHIELD Illinois, Shield T3, vaccine trials conducted at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) and a mass vaccination effort at UIC.
The SHIELD system includes the saliva-based COVID-19 test as well as the companion app to deliver test results, all developed at UIUC. SHIELD Illinois was created to share the SHIELD system across the state and the test is now in use or being launched at numerous other colleges and universities, community colleges, public community testing sites, private companies and more than 1,200 K-12 schools. Through Shield T3, the SHIELD system is now in use at a number of other universities, school systems and other organizations outside Illinois. Shield T3 has deployed six mobile labs around the country to support those efforts, with more planned.
UIC has been a trial site for two national clinical vaccine trials, including the first trial conducted in the city. UIC and its academic health enterprise, UI Health, also led a vaccination effort that vaccinated health system workers, and opened Chicago’s first mass vaccination site in February 2021 at Credit Union 1 Arena, offering vaccines to the public as well as its own students, faculty and staff. 
The Presidential Medallion is given to recognize individuals who support and bring distinction to the University of Illinois System; enhancing and accelerating its ability to deliver on its mission in profound ways. The award is bestowed solely at the discretion of the president, and the 30 bestowed by President Killeen related to pandemic response are the first of his six years in office.
Previous recipients include Shahid Kahn, a UIUC alumnus who owns the Flex-N-Gate company, the NFL’s Jacksonville Jaguars and English soccer team Fulham F.C., in 2013; civil rights leader Myrlie Evers, also in 2013; members of the Tuskegee Airmen, in 2007; and Thomas M. Siebel, an alumnus and the founder, chairman and CEO of C3.ai, in 2001.

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
As you probably know, this morning, Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced a mandate that all state employees and university students must be vaccinated against COVID-19. With the recent FDA approval of the Pfizer vaccine, we have even more evidence that vaccines are safe and effective. And we know they help mitigate the effects of Delta and other variants. I am confident that today’s state mandate will help us fight COVID-19, so we can end this pandemic that is causing so much suffering and anxiety for our community and our world.
We already have a vaccination requirement in place on campus, and we have made significant progress in that effort. I write today to reinforce our rules and processes based on the governor’s announcement.
Everyone on campus must wear a face covering when indoors at any university facility.
All faculty, staff and students must have received their first dose of a university-accepted COVID-19 vaccine by Sept. 5, if they plan to continue to be on campus this semester.
Those who have not yet been vaccinated must do so immediately. In the meantime, they must continue to participate in the on-campus COVID-19 testing program until they are fully vaccinated with a verified Vaccination Record Card in the MyMcKinley Portal.
Employees and students who are not able to receive the vaccine for medical or religious reasons must request an exemption, and we will share information on the exemption process in the coming days.
Those who receive an exemption must continue participating in the testing program under the frequency established by the university, which could increase based on the spread of the disease.
Those who do not comply with the mandate will face disciplinary action.
We are still receiving vaccine information and verifying it, but these are the percentages of verified vaccinations for various student and employee groups on campus as of this morning.
Undergraduate students: 88%
Graduate students: 88%
Faculty: 82%
Academic professionals: 87%
Civil service: 65%
Please note that these preliminary numbers represent only the verified information of people who have uploaded their COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card to the MyMcKinley Portal.
These percentages will grow as more people are vaccinated and upload their records. If you need assistance uploading your vaccination record, please contact the Wellness Answer Center via email at covidwellness@illinois.edu or call 217-333-1900. Technology Services has also set up support desks across campus to provide hands-on assistance for those who need it. Some units may also have additional on-site support to help with uploading cards. Please reach out to your IT director to learn about any opportunities.
If you have received your first dose of an approved vaccine, make sure to get your final dose as soon as you are able to do so and upload your information immediately.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our goal has been to maximize the safety of our entire university community and to do so with transparency. These numbers are a good start, and our students are doing a great job leading the way, but those who have not yet fulfilled this mandate must do so immediately.
If you have not already been vaccinated, find a nearby appointment at vaccines.gov and get vaccinated today. Students can also make an appointment to be vaccinated at CRCE through the MyMcKinley Portal.
Thank you for helping us demonstrate to the world how to crush this pandemic.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear students, faculty and staff:
I am grateful to Governor J.B. Pritzker and fully endorse his decision today to require COVID-19 vaccinations for all students, faculty and staff at Illinois colleges and universities, as well as to initiate a statewide mask mandate in public buildings for everyone aged 2 and older regardless of vaccination status. Over the summer, the University of Illinois System announced those same requirements for our students, faculty and staff for the new semester that began Monday.
The governor’s requirements and ours are in alignment and represent the best approach to curb rising COVID-19 infection and hospitalization rates across the state. They are consistent with our own scientific modeling of the risks associated with the spread of the virus and its variants, as well as the Illinois Department of Public Health’s guidance and goals.
We expect everyone on our campuses to follow these important, life-saving requirements. Those who are not yet vaccinated must comply with the governor’s executive order. Masks are already required indoors on our campuses, but will now also be required in all public buildings beginning Monday.
Throughout the pandemic, our students, faculty and staff have made the U of I System the gold standard for safety and a model for the nation. We have pulled together magnificently over the past 18 months and I have every expectation that you will lead the way again, building on our great momentum.
My deepest thanks to all of you for your cooperation and compassion, and I wish you the very best as we fulfill our missions and continue our remarkable efforts to help move beyond the pandemic.
Sincerely,
Tim"

        Dear Colleagues,
We are excited to start the fall semester this week and welcome everyone back to this new year at Illinois. Your dedication and effort throughout the last 18 months has been critical in helping maximize the safety of everyone in our community and in allowing us to offer the kind of in-person experiences so many of our students have missed.

        Welcome students, faculty and staff!
This fall, we have our sights set on a semester that will bring back the familiar rhythms of campus life that were disrupted by a global pandemic. We plan classes that are largely in-person, albeit with some that will remain hybrid or online. We envision buildings and offices filled with activity again. We are counting on fans being present to cheer on our athletes; the return of concerts, cultural events and student activities; and the traditional bustle between classes that has been quieted by COVID-19.
Still, the virus and its variants have taught us to expect the unexpected. So we will stay on our toes, prepared to tweak or even overhaul our plans as needed to ensure the safety of our campus communities.
But the last 18 months have proven that our University of Illinois family will lead the way through whatever challenges we are handed. We pioneered a testing protocol now used around the world and hosted seminal clinical trials for vaccines and therapeutics that have restored a semblance of normal and hope for an end to the crisis. We pulled together for an academic year that made us a model for the nation, maintaining on-campus learning with no serious student illnesses while many of our peers across the nation struggled.
I couldn’t be prouder of our students, faculty and staff for their creativity, resilience, selflessness and sacrifice, and for proving yet again that our system of three best-in-class universities is altogether extraordinary.
Whether you are returning this fall or joining us for the first time, I wish you a year of fulfillment that reaffirms the hopes and dreams that led you here.
Sincerely,
Tim"

                August 23, 2021 2:02 PM
			
        Dear Colleagues,
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is committed to upholding Illinois law requiring the University to reasonably accommodate its students’ religious beliefs, observances, and practices in regard to admissions, class attendance, and the scheduling of examinations and work requirements. Whenever possible, it is best practice to plan exams, required labs, and other due dates around religious holidays. The Religious Observances Calendar is an excellent resource to bookmark for reference to find listings of the primary sacred times for many world religions by year.
When planning around such dates is impossible, instructors need to provide accommodations for students who have a religious observance as outlined in the Student Code, Article 1, Part 5 – Class Attendance and Article 1, Section 1-107 on Religious Beliefs, Observances, and Practices. Notable for unit executive officers, Section 1-107 b. allows appeals to the dean of the academic unit offering the course when a religious accommodation is not granted or a student believes that the accommodation is unreasonable. Accordingly, units should be prepared to have a process for the dean to hear such appeals or to have a committee, such as a capricious grading committee or the executive committee, that will hear appeals and act on behalf of the dean. Appeals should be rare, as instructors are expected to offer reasonable accommodations as required under Illinois law.
Information for faculty on accommodating religious observances contains helpful tips for application and best practices. Instructors who have questions may contact Stephen Bryan, Dean of Students, at 217-333-0050 or via email at deanofstudents@illinois.edu.
Thank you for your time and consideration of this important matter.

28 receive U of I System honor for leading COVID-19 responsePresidential Medallions given to leaders behind SHIELD efforts and vaccine work 
URBANA, Ill. – University of Illinois President Tim Killeen on Monday honored 28 key leaders of the system’s COVID-19 response with the Presidential Medallion. The medallion is the highest honor that the system president can bestow.
In a ceremony at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) attended by Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Killeen honored leaders behind the development of the SHIELD test-and-trace system and subsequent organizations created to expand its use beyond the system’s universities. Also honored were the leaders of clinical trials for vaccines at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), the first conducted in Chicago, and a mass-vaccination effort at UIC that has inoculated hospital staff and patients, students, faculty and, so far, tens of thousands of members of the public.
“I have never been more proud than I am today to recognize these colleagues and their leadership, said Killeen, awarding the first Presidential Medallions in his six years as president. ""Their ingenuity and dedication and the hard work of thousands of their colleagues across the U of I System have saved lives on our campuses, in the surrounding communities, and well beyond. Their efforts have demonstrated in real time what the U of I System means to the people of Illinois and ensured that our response to the pandemic has been unlike that of any university system in the world. These initiatives are reflective of the power of the U of I System as a real force for innovation, positive change and the public good.”
Pritzker praised those honored Monday for their service to the state of Illinois and its residents.
“In our fight against COVID-19, the efforts of the University of Illinois System have been a real asset to millions of Illinoisans,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said. “That begins with the successful effort last year to keep campuses open to the more than 90,000 students enrolled at U of I System universities. But it extends to the tens of thousands of people who found access to life-saving vaccines in the Chicago area, students at universities and community colleges who have been protected by the SHIELD test, and this fall to students at more than 1,000 K-12 schools around the state who will be protected by access to SHIELD. I am deeply grateful to the leaders being honored here today and to the thousands of others who have been part of the U of I System's aggressive and ongoing response to the pandemic.”
Those receiving the Presidential Medallion for their roles in the U of System’s response to the pandemic are listed below.
From SHIELD, SHIELD Illinois and Shield T3

                August 19, 2021 2:02 PM
			
        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
I am pleased to announce that College of ACES Dean Kim Kidwell will join my leadership team as the inaugural Associate Chancellor for Strategic Partnerships and Initiatives effective Sept. 16, pending approval by the Board of Trustees. Until Board approval has been received, her title will be Interim Associate Chancellor for Strategic Partnerships and Initiatives. She will remain a tenured faculty member in her home department, Crop Sciences. Provost Cangellaris will be consulting with the ACES Executive Committee, as well as members of the college leadership team and members of the faculty, to choose an interim dean and to outline a process and timeline for a search to recruit the next permanent dean.
In her new role, Dean Kidwell will be working with my leadership team, as well as in close collaboration with the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation in the development of high-priority, high-impact, multi-stakeholder initiatives for the university. Her initial emphasis will be focused on leveraging the Next 150 strategic plan and campus investments, as well as the Illinois Innovation Network (IIN) and Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) framework to develop initiatives and partnerships that will position the University to lead the scientific discoveries, innovations and public-private partnerships that will inspire and empower tomorrow’s sustainable food and agricultural systems. Dean Kidwell will also be the Illinois lead on the IIN Governing Council and be engaged with their strategic planning efforts this fall. Additional priorities in her new role will include developing new public-private partnerships to catalyze new initiatives in data-driven agriculture and personalized nutrition and to establish a more robust state support network for rural health and nutrition. Significantly, this investment of an Associate Chancellor for Strategic Partnership to implement key initiatives in the Next 150 strategic plan will deepen partnerships with state and federal agencies, elected leaders and new bridges between university scholarship and public policy to accelerate agricultural innovation and development for new discoveries, new jobs and a more competitive state.
Dean Kidwell’s tenure at ACES has been marked by new initiatives and programs that have positioned the college to meet the needs of our 21st century society. Programs like the new Metropolitan Food and Environment Systems major have reinvigorated undergraduate interest and enrollment. There has been a significant expansion of the research capital infrastructure and portfolio that includes several major new federally funded centers in digital agriculture and artificial intelligence, as well as the completion of the long-anticipated Feed Technology Center. And the college’s capacity to offer world-class experiences and programs has been further fueled by impressive growth in corporate and private philanthropic support. That success culminated with this summer’s announcement of a new $45 million donation from Doris E. Christopher – the largest gift in the college’s history.
These accomplishments, along with her development of new external partnerships and the reimaging and realignment of Extension, make Dean Kidwell the clear choice to lead this critical new effort for our university.
Please join me in congratulating Dean Kidwell in her new role here at Illinois.

                August 18, 2021 2:02 PM
			
        Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,
As part of our university’s work to acknowledge our responsibility to the Native Nations for whom Illinois is their ancestral home and establish meaningful reciprocal relationships with these Nations, I am pleased to announce that Jacki Thompson Rand will become the inaugural Associate Vice Chancellor for Native Affairs and Senior Adviser to the Chancellor on Native Affairs Issues. As a member of the senior leadership of the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion, Dr. Rand will serve as the university’s Tribal Liaison to help the campus establish and maintain respectful relationships with Native American Nations and help our university adopt standards and strategies appropriate for Native tribal and Indigenous community engagement. In this role, Dr. Rand also will collaborate with the NAGPRA Office in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research & Innovation, which is responsible for upholding our university’s commitment to the repatriation of our Native American, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian collections in consultation with tribal communities and lineal descendants.
An enrolled citizen of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, Dr. Rand brings an expertise in public and community-facing research that ideally positions her to serve in this new role. Prior to Illinois, Dr. Rand served as faculty in the Department of History at the University of Iowa for more than two decades, and at Illinois, she will join the faculty of the American Indian Studies Program. Working at the intersections of American Indian Studies, History, and Gender and Women's Studies, she utilizes the methodologies and ethics of public and digital humanities, archival and oral history research, and community engagement to account for Native American experiences within and across the 19th and 20th centuries. At Iowa, she also participated in the Iowa First Nations Program, which hosts high school students from Nations that occupied the state of Iowa and surrounding region, and was the co-coordinator of the Native American and Indigenous Studies Program.
At the state and national level, Dr. Rand has served on the American Indian Council for the Office of the State Archeologist where she advised on issues related to the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, and has extensive experience with museums, including 11 years in various roles at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington D.C., where she conceptualized and planned community consultations in Indian Country throughout the United States. Dr. Rand is the author of Kiowa Humanity and the Invasion of the State (University of Nebraska Press, 2008) and an ongoing digital humanities project on the Indigenous Midwest. She holds a Ph.D. in History from the University of Oklahoma.
Please join me in congratulating Dr. Jacki Thompson Rand on assuming this important role for the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and help welcome her to our community.
Sincerely,
Sean C. GarrickVice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion"

                August 18, 2021 10:01 AM
			
        Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is committed to the most fundamental principles of academic freedom, equality of opportunity and human dignity. In order to enable all members of the campus community to fully and freely participate in their educational, research and workplace experiences, we must identify and address behaviors that negatively affect the climate of inclusion and belonging on our campus. More than ever, it is critical that our university prioritizes building a campus environment that allows people of all backgrounds to participate in the constructive exchange of ideas based in respect and true inclusion. Acts of racism, sexism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and other negative behaviors do not have a place at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and must not be allowed to impact our commitment to create a campus community that values the full range of talents, perspectives, cultures, faith traditions and life experiences that the nearly 60,000 members of the university community bring to our campus each year.
The Bias Assessment and Response Team (BART) has been an important and visible mechanism to help students, faculty and staff to inform the university when they encounter behaviors that negatively impact their campus experience. As we begin this new academic year, we are taking some important steps and making new investments to enhance this critical service. Additionally, the program will transition into the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (VCDEI) from its previous home in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs (VCSA). This service is strongly aligned with the VCDEI’s mission, and this decision comes at the joint recommendation of both offices following an extensive evaluation over the last year.
During this transition between offices, members of our campus community will see no disruption or interruption of this critical support service.
The transition will include new processes designed to:
Offer a mechanism for students, staff and faculty to inform the university if they experience behaviors that negatively affect their experience on campus.
Leverage new investments of resources and personnel to maximize the accessibility, responsiveness and effectiveness of the process for members of our community.
Educate the campus community on relevant issues related to diversity, equity, inclusion, access, free speech and academic freedom.
Consistently affirm our institutional commitment to a campus environment that values diverse perspectives and constructive dialogue.
As has always been the case, the process is not part of the University’s disciplinary systems and participation is not mandatory by any member of the campus community.
We will continue to respond to reports submitted by members of the campus community about negative behaviors that impact experiences of inclusion and belonging in a prompt and equitable manner. Beginning August 23, reports can be submitted at go.illinois.edu/campusbelonging, and will be received by VCDEI staff, who will coordinate response to the reports. The current BART site will also automatically forward to the new reporting portal.
Our transition plan includes a commitment to hire additional professional full-time staff members, which will allow us to continue to improve our responsiveness and educational efforts. The campus community will also have an opportunity to provide comment on the design of the new process. We will share more information with the campus community during the fall semester about opportunities to provide feedback and next steps in the development of the new initiative. Based on campus feedback and assessment, additional refinements will be made to the new process in spring 2022.
I would like to thank Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Dr. Danita Brown Young, the BART co-chairs, January Boten and Debra Imel, and all members of our community who have volunteered their time to serve on the BART committee.
I hope that you will share your perspectives as we build this new resource to strengthen the sense of campus belonging throughout our university community.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear students,
As we approach the beginning of the Fall 2021 semester, I’m writing to remind you about some important COVID-19 policies the university will have in place to maximize the safety of our entire community.
Important On-Campus COVID-19 Requirements
You are required to be vaccinated for COVID-19 if you are able. OR You are required to participate in the on-campus COVID-19 testing program if you are not able to be vaccinated or if your vaccination record card has not yet been verified by the university.
If you have not yet been vaccinated and you are able to do so, there will be walk-in COVID-19 vaccines available this week (Aug. 17-19) at State Farm Center from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day.

You are required to wear a face covering indoors in all university spaces.
If you have been vaccinated, you are required to upload a photo of your Vaccination Record Card to the MyMcKinley Portal. Once it is verified, you will receive “Granted” building access status. (A recent negative on-campus test also gives you “Granted” building access status.)
You are required to have “Granted” building access status in either the Safer Illinois app (recommended) or the Boarding Pass.
If asked, you are required to show your building access status to your professors, supervisor, advisor, Wellness Support Associates and university healthcare professionals.
You are not required to show the vaccination status screen in your app to anyone. This is your private health information.

If you test positive for COVID-19, you are required to follow instructions from the university and the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District.
Though people who are fully vaccinated are not required to participate in the COVID-19 testing program for building access, the university encourages every student to get tested immediately if they experience any symptoms.
We continue to take guidance from the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and the Champaign Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD), and we are actively monitoring COVID-19 on campus and in the local community. We will make modifications to our approach for the semester if necessary. For more information about the university’s COVID-19 policies, visit covid19.illinois.edu. If you have questions, please email covid-19@illinois.edu.
We have confidence in our approach for this semester, and we are delighted to welcome you all back to campus for the start of the academic year. Thanks to COVID-19 vaccines and our unmatched on-campus COVID-19 testing ecosystem, I am very optimistic about this semester, and I look forward to seeing you back on campus.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Instructors,
As we have done in the past, we’re once again asking you to help us distribute important safety information to our students. Emergencies can happen anywhere and at any time, so it’s important that we take a minute to prepare ourselves for a situation in which our safety could depend on our ability to react quickly.
Before the first day of class this semester, we ask that you visit http://police.illinois.edu/instructor-resources. There, you’ll find two items: A brief script we hope you will read on the first day of class and a one-page handout that we would like to have distributed to all students either by hand or as part of your syllabus.
These two items contain valuable information that can keep us all safer in the event that a fire, weather emergency or active threat should emerge. By distributing this information, we are ensuring that everyone in our campus community is empowered with tools they can use to protect themselves and others.
We also encourage you to empower yourself by visiting http://police.illinois.edu/safe. There are steps you can take right now to prepare should you find yourself in an emergency situation.
Thank you for taking a few minutes to enhance the safety of our campus community.
Sincerely,
Alice CaryExecutive Director of Public Safety and Chief of Police"

        Dear faculty and staff,
I am pleased to announce that Michael DeLorenzo will be the Vice Chancellor for Administration and Operations Designate, pending approval by the Board of Trustees. This position change is a well-deserved recognition of the role that Mike is already playing in leadership and responsibility at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The new position will take effect Aug. 16.
Mike has been serving in executive leadership roles for 14 years at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and he has more than 30 years of leadership experience working in higher education. Before he arrived at Illinois, he held positions at the University of Illinois Chicago and the University of Florida. Mike has a bachelor’s degree in history from Colorado State University, a master’s degree in sports administration from The Ohio State University and a Ph.D. in public administration from the University of Illinois Chicago.
Mike currently serves as Senior Associate Chancellor for Administration and Operations for the university. A member of the university’s senior leadership team, he serves as liaison to the Division of Intercollegiate Athletics and oversees the Division of Public Safety, Facilities and Services, Parking, Purchasing, the Illinois Fire Safety Institute, the Police Training Institute and Willard Airport.
His expanded role will add Allerton Mansion, the Chicago Illini Center, Facility Classroom and Event Management and Scheduling, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign contracts, campus space usage, Altgeld and McFarland Carillion and other areas to his current portfolio. He will also have responsibility for the university’s emergency planning.
In his new role, he will continue to lead the university as the chair of the COVID-19 Executive Leadership Committee. I cannot overstate the impact Mike has played in this role since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to his already extensive portfolio, he has been the driving force behind the university’s reputation for COVID-19 safety and innovation. His discerning judgment, collaborative approach, adaptability, understanding of the university and relationships with community partners have guided every facet of our pandemic response. Our university community owes Mike its gratitude for his steady leadership during one of the most important, unknown and critical periods in our university history. He will continue to lead in this role, and I am confident he will do so with great impact.
Please join me in congratulating Mike on his well-deserved appointment as Vice Chancellor for Administration and Operations at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

2021-07-29T10:09:00Z,2021-07-29,10:9,92646,Face coverings required in all University facilities...,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/1483839306.html,"Face coverings required in all University facilities beginning July 30
                July 29, 2021 10:09 AM
			
        Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,
On Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a new recommendation that even fully vaccinated individuals should wear face coverings in public indoor settings in areas of substantial or high community transmission of COVID-19. The Illinois Department of Public Health and the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) fully support this new guidance. Even though our campus community is making good progress in mitigating COVID-19 impacts with our vaccination and testing participation, Champaign County remains among those areas with concerning levels of transmission.
Consistent with our practice of following CDC and public health COVID-19 guidance, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign will once again require all faculty, staff, students and visitors to wear a face covering inside our university facilities beginning on Friday, July 30. 
Updated Indoor Face Covering Guidance
All university students, faculty, staff and visitors must wear a face covering in university spaces indoors, regardless of vaccination status. For unvaccinated individuals, university face covering requirements remain the same.
For all individuals, a face covering does not have to be worn when eating or drinking, when alone in an office or room with the door closed or when alone in a vehicle—essentially, when you are alone in a private space.
Individuals with a medical condition or disability that prevents them from safely wearing a face covering may seek a reasonable accommodation. Students needing an accommodation should contact the division of Disability Resources & Educational Services, and employees (including student employees) needing workplace accommodations should contact the ADA Division of the Office for Access and Equity.
This requirement is limited to face coverings only. There are no new social distancing or capacity restrictions at this time.
Unit plans for the return-to-on-site operations are not impacted by this new face covering requirement.
Individuals who witness unsafe COVID-19 behavior by a student or employee may submit their experiences here: http://go.illinois.edu/COVID19-report. These reports are reviewed by Student Affairs and Illinois Human Resources, who will also manage any necessary follow-up.
This face covering requirement will remain in effect until CUPHD determines that county-wide case rates, hospitalizations, transmission levels and outbreaks return to levels that allow the requirement to be lifted. But we should all plan for the face covering requirement to be in effect when we open the fall semester.
I remind everyone that our previously announced vaccination, testing and facility access requirements for faculty and staff and for students remain in effect and are unchanged. If you have not uploaded your vaccination information to the MyMcKinley portal, I urge you to do so as soon as possible to ensure the smoothest opening for your fall semester.
Vaccinations and our comprehensive testing program are the most powerful tools we have available to let us come back together as a University and community, and the surest way to avoid setbacks like this latest return to face coverings. We are fortunate that vaccinations are readily available in our community to individuals who are 12 or older. You can find information about where and how to receive a COVID-19 vaccination shot here. As I said earlier, the virus continues to impact all of us. But together, we can help our entire county and community navigate these challenges. 
Once again, we see how guidance and expectations can change quickly as we continue to navigate this pandemic. We are working quickly to update the university COVID-19 website and our existing resources with this guidance and information. We will continue to provide more information about any further adjustments or changes to our operations and policies. If you have questions about any of these new changes, you can always email COVID-19@illinois.edu.
Thank you for your patience and thank you for once again wearing a face covering inside our university facilities starting on Friday, July 30.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear faculty, staff and students,  
I am pleased to announce Professor Venetria K. Patton as the Harry E. Preble Dean Designate of the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences. She is currently Head of the School of Interdisciplinary Studies at Purdue University. Professor Patton will begin this new role on August 2, 2021, pending approval by the University of Illinois Board of Trustees.
Following a national search for this position, I consulted with the search committee, College leadership and with Chancellor Robert Jones. Professor Patton emerged as the best candidate to serve as the next dean.
Professor Patton has held several leadership roles at Purdue University. Before serving as Head of the School of Interdisciplinary Studies, Professor Patton served as Provost Fellow for Diversity and Inclusion and before that, as director of the African American Studies and Research Center.
Before arriving at Purdue, she was an Associate Professor of English and of African American Studies at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Her teaching and research are focused on African American and Diasporic Women’s Literature. She holds a B.A. in English from the University of La Verne and an M.A. and Ph.D. in English from the University of California-Riverside.
The university home of roughly one-third of students and faculty on our campus, our College of Liberal Arts & Sciences has a legacy of excellence and a strong reputation. I am confident that Professor Patton will advance the college and amplify the world-renowned, human-centered scholarship being done across disciplines to advance the world.
I wish to express my sincere gratitude to Professor Gene Robinson who has led LAS as interim dean since July 2020. Under his leadership, the College’s excellence has continued to advance and laid a solid foundation for future growth and success. We thank him for this service as he returns to lead the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology (IGB) following an extremely successful five-year review of his IGB leadership conducted last year. I also thank Professor Don Ort who in turn served as acting director of the IGB this past year.
I also want to thank the members of the search committee, chaired by Dean Vikram Amar, for their efforts and commitment to this search.
Please join me in congratulating Professor Patton on her appointment as dean designate of the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
Sincerely,

                July 27, 2021 10:17 AM
			
        Because of the extreme heat forecasted for the Midwest this week and anticipated high electric demand on the regional grid, Facilities & Services (F&S) is designating today through Wednesday, July 28, as an Energy Alert period for the Urbana campus.
F&S asks that all students, faculty, and staff in university facilities help maximize unit and individual energy conservation efforts, especially between the hours of 2 and 6 p.m., when demand is typically the greatest. Please take additional actions to conserve energy.
Turn it off!If practical, shut off, shut down, sleep mode, or unplug the following:
Lights
Computers
Monitors
Printers
Chargers
Appliances
Other nonessential equipment
Keep it closed!Close the following items to protect facility equipment and systems:    
Outside windows and doors in air conditioned areas
Fume hood sashes when not in use
Window shades to ensure rooms stay cool
Why is taking action during Energy Alerts important?Abbott Power Plant generates approximately half of the campus’ electricity through an efficient cogeneration process, which simultaneously produces both steam and electricity. The remainder of the power needed to support teaching and research activities is purchased from the regional grid.
The hot and humid conditions over the next two days, combined with energy resource availability, have the potential to set new peak usage levels for this year. As a participant in the electric market, the university pays a capacity charge based on usage at the moment of the peak demand load. This capacity charge is incorporated into the campus utility rate, and adjustments can potentially lead to increased electrical prices for the university. Who answers temperature-related questions?Please contact the F&S Energy Management Control Center fandsenergycomm@illinois.edu, 217-244-3783, regarding any hot/cold issues in campus facilities. The center features enhanced data monitoring and integrated building system automation to perform diagnostics and assist with operational response.
Thank you for helping to reduce our electrical demand during these peak periods. Conserving energy is everyone’s responsibility and at the core of our commitment to sustainability on campus.

        Dear Faculty, Staff, and Students:
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign values and respects all people in our campus community, including those deceased individuals whose remains are in our care. In light of recent events regarding treatment of the remains of African American or enslaved individuals at universities and museums across the country, the University reaffirms its commitment to the respectful care of all human remains.
In particular, we recognize that the remains of African American and other individuals who have been marginalized - descendants of enslaved individuals, Native Ancestors, individuals brought here from outside of the United States and cadavers used in medical education - all deserve the same dignity, care, and respect.
The University is currently working to confirm the histories and identities of all human remains on campus. In 2020, we established a campus-wide office (the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act Office) to lead efforts to care for and return the remains of Native Ancestors and funerary and cultural items in campus collections. While we do not believe that the University houses the remains of any African American or enslaved individuals, we are auditing existing collections to determine appropriate next steps. We also are considering how best to approach the care and return of human remains originating from outside of the United States. We are committed to close collaboration with descendant communities as we undertake this work. 
If you have questions about the audit, or if you would like to disclose the presence of human remains on campus, please reach out to the NAGPRA Office (nagpra@illinois.edu) for additional guidance. The team, which is housed in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation, includes experts in the analysis of human skeletal remains and works closely with descendant communities, in partnership with the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion. 
Thank you for your careful attention to this important issue.

        Dear faculty and staff,
As you may have read in a message from President Tim Killeen, the University of Illinois System is requiring that faculty and staff at all three universities (Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield) receive a complete course of COVID-19 vaccines before the beginning of the Fall 2021 semester, if they are able to do so. For employees covered by a union contract, guidance will be implemented through the applicable collective bargaining processes.
When we announced the COVID-19 vaccination requirement for our students several weeks ago, you may remember that we said at that time there were no plans to do the same for faculty and staff. Since that time, the System made the decision to require COVID-19 vaccinations for faculty and staff. We fully support this decision and believe that widespread COVID-19 vaccinations at our university provide the best opportunity to maximize the safety of our entire community.
Though this requirement is new, operationally, our protocols for the Fall 2021 semester will remain nearly identical to those previously announced:
Faculty and staff should be vaccinated for COVID-19 if they are able to do so.
Faculty and staff who are not vaccinated will continue to be required to wear face coverings and participate in the on-campus COVID-19 testing program. For the Fall 2021 semester, this means testing and receiving negative test results twice per week.
The university is following Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) guidance and accepting vaccines currently authorized for emergency use by either the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the World Health Organization.
Vaccinated faculty and staff should submit their Vaccination Record Card to the MyMcKinley Portal and have it verified.
If you have not been vaccinated for COVID-19 and you are able to do so, visit vaccines.gov to find available appointments or walk-in hours in your local area.
If you are not able to be fully vaccinated before the beginning of the Fall 2021 semester (due to timing, travel, etc.), please continue to test until you are fully vaccinated and your Vaccination Record Card has been uploaded and verified in the MyMcKinley Portal.
We acknowledge that some individuals have health conditions or other reasons why they cannot be vaccinated. For those individuals, the COVID-19 testing program and face coverings will continue to be required.
The CDC has shared data showing that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and fully vaccinated individuals can start to resume most aspects of pre-pandemic life. The CDC has also provided guidance about COVID-19 vaccinations for higher education institutions that further strengthens the System's decision to require everyone (faculty, staff and students) to be fully vaccinated. 
I know that during this pandemic, new guidance and expectations have changed quickly. Thank you for your continued patience and understanding as we navigate this next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear colleagues:
As part of our ongoing commitment to the safety of our campuses and the communities around them, the University of Illinois System will require that all faculty and staff be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 by the beginning of the fall semester of 2021. For employees covered by a union contract, guidance will be implemented at the universities through the applicable collective bargaining processes.
This vaccine requirement follows similar guidance provided to our students in June and is consistent with our own scientific modeling of the risks associated with the spread of the virus and its variants, as well as the Illinois Department of Public Health’s guidance and goals.
We recognize that some individuals are not able to be vaccinated. That is why it is so important that those of us who can get vaccinated do so. Those who are not vaccinated will need to follow campus-specific or system-office guidelines and any exemption protocols issued by each university, the U of I Hospital and clinics, or the System Offices.
Throughout the pandemic, we have not compromised the education, student experience and groundbreaking research that make the U of I System truly extraordinary. You, along with our students, have been the authors of that success, helping make the system a model for collective effort in pursuit of the common good.
Now we look forward to your help in setting a new standard this fall, a semester in which we will restore most in-person instruction and many of the other traditional rhythms of campus life. This will not be possible without widespread vaccinations.
Each of our universities will follow up with additional guidance on vaccinations and other safety measures planned for the fall. We will also continue to monitor our policies closely, adjusting where appropriate based on advances in scientific understanding and updated guidance from public health authorities.
Sincerely,
Tim"

        Dear faculty, staff and students, 
We are pleased to share that COVID-19 testing for community members is now more widely available through SHIELD CU. Free testing for all community members (age 8 and older) is now offered at Parkland Community College in addition to State Farm Center. Please note the immediate changes to State Farm Center community testing hours and days below.
Testing times and locations are subject to change. Visit osfhealthcare.org/shield-cu or check the Safer Community app for up-to-date hours and locations.
State Farm Center 1800 S. First Street, ChampaignSun: 10 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.Tues, Thurs, Fri: 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.Closed for lunch between 11:30 a.m. and noon
Parkland Community CollegeM-4 parking lot tent2400 W. Bradley Avenue, ChampaignMon, Wed, Sat: 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
This recent expansion of testing is part of a collaboration with the Illinois Department of Public Health to make the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign’s COVID-19 saliva test available to community colleges and schools across the state. 
COVID-19 testing remains an essential component of our community’s efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect the safety of all. Below are some recent enhancements to the SHIELD CU program to make testing easier and more useful to community members:
Parents and guardians with minors can access multiple family accounts within a single log in using the Safer Community app.
The Safer Community app now offers the option to print or email test results.
Those who are unable to use the Safer Community app may still test by registering in person and getting their test results by phone.

        Dear faculty and staff,
As many of you prepare to return to on-site work for the Fall 2021 semester, I am writing to share additional details about COVID-19 requirements and protocols. In order to maximize the safety of our entire community, the university will have updated precautions in place. Please read this email carefully to ensure you are able to follow the guidelines. Please also view this email that was sent to all students.
Vaccines & Testing  
If you have already been vaccinated for COVID-19 with a university-accepted vaccine, you should upload your Vaccination Record Card to the MyMcKinley Portal as soon as possible. See more information here. If you have already uploaded your record, you do not need to do it again.
If you are an unvaccinated faculty or staff member who is working fully on-site or on a hybrid schedule, you are required to participate in the on-campus COVID-19 testing program as soon as you return on-site.
You will be required to test and receive negative results twice per week to maintain building access. This testing frequency will take effect starting on Aug. 2.
This testing frequency was been chosen based on SHIELD team modeling that shows this testing frequency is necessary to maximize the safety of individuals in our community who are unvaccinated.

Face Coverings
If you are fully vaccinated, following CDC guidelines, the university no longer requires you to wear face coverings, except in healthcare settings including COVID-19 testing centers, the McKinley Health Center, etc. See the full list of locations where face coverings are required for everyone here.
If you are not fully vaccinated, following CDC guidelines, the university will require you to wear face coverings in university spaces, except when you are alone in a private space.
Note: Some fully vaccinated individuals may also choose to continue wearing face coverings. I encourage you to be mindful of this as people make their individual choices. You should not assume that someone wearing a face covering is unvaccinated.
Other COVID-19 Protocols
If you have previously been on-campus while COVID-19 protocols have been in place, some procedures will be different. There will still be Wellness Support Associates (WSAs) who conduct daily spot checks across campus at various classroom buildings. Certain buildings may also choose to hire their own WSAs for the semester. At some facilities, you may be required to show your building access screen (which shows if you are compliant via being vaccinated or testing, by using the Safer Illinois app or the Boarding Pass). You are not required to share or prove your vaccination status.
If you will be working fully on-site or on a hybrid schedule, please also familiarize yourself with the information on these webpages as there have been many updates this week:
On-Campus instructors
Logistics for the on-campus testing program
On-campus testing site locations
Building access procedures
Safer Illinois app
Boarding Pass
Face covering policies
Travel guidelines
Testing positive for COVID-19 resources
Facility protocols
Health/support resources
Mental health/wellness resources

If you are teaching a course for the Fall 2021 semester, please also read this FAQ for faculty/instructors thoroughly.
Please know these are the planned COVID-19 requirements and protocols we anticipate being in place for the Fall 2021 semester. However, we know that COVID-19 can be unpredictable. The university SHIELD team will continue to monitor for spread, spikes and emerging variants, including B.1.617.2 (Delta) which is already present in the county. We will also continue to follow guidance from the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD), the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC).
Thank you all for continuing to make choices that protect the health and well-being of our entire community. I am hopeful and excited for this upcoming semester—to see many of you walking across campus, to gather safely together at events and to continue to build the most powerful university family in the world.  It is such a privilege and honor to be your chancellor. I am grateful to each one of you.

        Dear students,
As you prepare for the Fall 2021 semester, I am writing to share additional details about COVID-19 requirements and protocols. In order to maximize the safety of our entire community, the university will have updated precautions in place. Please read this email carefully to ensure you are able to make a smooth transition back to campus in a few weeks.
Vaccines & Testing  
If you are able to be vaccinated for COVID-19, you are required to do so. You should be vaccinated as soon as possible with an accepted vaccine to ensure you meet the requirement. Visit vaccines.gov to find appointments in your local community. See more information here.
If you have already been vaccinated for COVID-19 with a university-accepted vaccine, you should upload your Vaccination Record Card to the MyMcKinley Portal as soon as possible. See more information here. If you have already uploaded your record, you do not need to do it again.
If you are an international student and you are not able to receive a university-accepted vaccine before you arrive on campus, you will be able to do so when you arrive. There will be on-campus vaccination appointments at the beginning of the semester. Until you are fully vaccinated and have a verified vaccine record, you will be required to continue the on-campus COVID-19 testing program. See more information here.
If you are not able to be vaccinated, there is NOT an exemption process for the COVID-19 vaccine requirement. Instead, all unvaccinated students are required to participate in the on-campus COVID-19 testing program. See more information about the on-campus COVID-19 testing program here.
If you are arriving to campus unvaccinated, you must begin on-campus COVID-19 testing as soon as you arrive. Testing frequencies have been chosen based on SHIELD team modeling that shows this testing frequency is necessary to maximize the safety of individuals in our community who are unvaccinated:
If you are an undergraduate student, you will be required to test and receive negative results every other day to maintain compliance and building access. This testing frequency will take effect starting on Aug. 2. 
If you are a graduate/professional student, you will be required to test and receive negative results twice per week to maintain compliance and building access. This testing frequency will take effect starting on Aug. 2. 

If you are not vaccinated, and you are not compliant with the on-campus COVID-19 testing program, you will face student discipline. See more information about COVID-19 policy enforcement here.

        Dear campus community member:
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is committed to creating a safe environment for everyone who participates in programs on our campus, including those who are under the age of 18. As many of you prepare to again begin hosting on-campus programs, camps and other activities, we would like to remind faculty and staff about the university policy on protection of minors and our procedures for implementing that policy. You can find more information on those items by following the below links.
Protection of minors policy: http://go.illinois.edu/POMpolicy
Procedures for implementing the policy: https://cam.illinois.edu/policies/hr-64/
Everyone involved in a university-sponsored program or activity and who is responsible for the supervision of minors or whose duties would require close contact with minors must undergo a criminal background check and sex offender registry check. Please review the implementation procedures for more information about this requirement.
These requirements apply to all university personnel, volunteers and contractors associated with events and activities where minors will be involved. Units with programs or activities designed to include minors who are not enrolled at the university are required report those activities to the University of Illinois Police Department at http://go.illinois.edu/POMform. External entities or Registered Student Organizations may report activities using a shortened version of this form which can be found at http://go.illinois.edu/POM-short-form.
Virtual or online events involving minors are subject to many of the same requirements as in-person events, and organizers must complete the protection of minors form for those activities as well.
You can visit the University Police website at http://go.illinois.edu/protection-of-minors for more information, including a five-minute video from the University of Illinois Ethics and Compliance Office explaining everything you need to know. We encourage you to use this video as a training tool in your unit.

        Dear Students and Employees,
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug Free Workplace Act and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act requires the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:
http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/
The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.
Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to marijuana in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s marijuana prohibition.
The university’s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.
The university’s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.
Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. University employees should contact Illinois Human Resources at (217) 333-2137.
Sincerely,
Dr. Danita M. Brown YoungVice Chancellor for Student Affairs"

        Facilities & Services (F&S) is designating June 29, 30, and July 1, an Energy Alert period for the Urbana campus. The transmission operator, who monitors the load on the regional grid, has indicated that a combination of extreme weather and current resource availability may require producers and consumers to take proactive measures that manage the demand on the regional electric grid. F&S’ Utilities & Energy Services division is continuing to monitor conditions. If further action is needed, an additional notice will request individuals, departments, colleges, institutes, and units to reduce energy usage to the greatest extent possible in university facilities.
Why is taking action during an Energy Alert important to the university?Abbott Power Plant generates approximately half the campus’ electricity through an efficient cogeneration process, which simultaneously produces both steam and electricity. The remainder of the power needed to support teaching and research activities is purchased from the regional grid. Reducing energy consumption during this period lowers the capacity charge assessed to campus for the coming year.
What can you do to help?Should Energy Alert conditions persist, you can help Beat the Peak by taking action during the lingering hot and humid conditions, especially between noon and 10 p.m. or when leaving facilities for the day or the weekend.
If practical, shut off, shut down, sleep mode, or unplug the following:
Lights
Computers
Monitors
Printers
Chargers
Appliances
Window AC units in unused spaces
Other nonessential equipment
Close the following items to help further protect facility equipment and systems:    
Outside windows and doors in air-conditioned areas
Window shades to block the sun
Fume hood sashes when not in use
For temperature-related questions regarding specific rooms and building spaces, please contact the F&S Energy Management Control Center at fandsenergycomm@illinois.edu, 217-244-3783.
Conserving energy is everyone’s responsibility at the university. Thank you for remaining energy-aware.

        Dear colleagues:
I am thrilled to tell you about our second cohort of faculty and researchers who will receive funding under the University of Illinois System’s Presidential Initiative: Expanding the Impact of the Arts and the Humanities.
In this new round of funding, 10 projects from across our three universities were selected for funding from 22 extraordinary proposals. These 10 will share the available $1.54 million in support from the system.
The new projects all have the potential for groundbreaking impact, and I encourage you to read the details in the release below that will be sent to news media today.
The continuation of this initiative underscores the importance of the arts and the humanities to the U of I System. They are simply central to who we are – and to our missions of education, scholarship and public engagement. And they hold just tremendous potential to inspire and empower our students and enhance the public good.
I want to thank Barb Wilson, in particular, for shepherding this process forward, and the faculty and administrators who participated in the review process, as well as all involved in proposal preparation.
Please join me in congratulating these recipients.
Sincerely,

Arts & humanities initiative offers new support for 10 projectsPresident’s initiative will provide $1.54 million for a second round of projects  
The University of Illinois System continues to demonstrate its commitment to the arts and humanities, funding a second round of vital projects through the Presidential Initiative: Expanding the Impact of the Arts and the Humanities, President Tim Killeen announced today.
The new round of funding will provide $1.54 million to support 10 projects, including an effort to break down barriers between African studies and African-American studies, a project dedicated to increasing knowledge of the state’s rivers and a plan to transform art education with new ideas about disability.
Presidential Initiative: Expanding the Impact of the Arts and the Humanities was launched by Killeen to enhance and celebrate the arts and humanities at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) and University of Illinois Springfield (UIS).
“The arts and humanities enrich our lives and help us understand the human condition in an increasingly complex world. This has been illustrated to us all, once again, with vivid clarity over the past 15 months of the pandemic and societal upheaval. I believed it was vital to create this fund in order to support projects that help ‘light the path’ forward for all of us, and I am proud that the U of I System is now providing a second round of funding for such important work,” Killeen said.
The new projects further demonstrate the university system’s commitment to building a better society for all Illinoisans, said Cynthia Oliver, who is the associate vice chancellor for humanities, arts and related fields at UIUC and was a member of the committee that reviewed proposals.
“It is so important that we demonstrate the value of arts and humanities research on our campuses and what our artists and humanities scholars contribute to our overall quality of life, our intellectual stimulation and our creative impulses. Great imaginations are at work in all of these projects,” Oliver said. “That the University of Illinois System is committed to this kind of support is imperative, especially now. I am honored to have been a part of the selection process and am only sorry we didn’t have twice the amount of support to offer our brilliant colleagues and double the impact.”
Five of the new projects will receive $175,000 each and the other five will receive at least $85,000. By comparison, the median arts grant award in fiscal year 2018 from the National Endowment for the Arts was about $20,000 and 58 percent were less than $25,000, according to the advocacy group Grantmakers in the Arts.
Presidential Initiative: Expanding the Impact of the Arts and the Humanities is supported by both the offices of the president and the executive vice president of the U of I System, using funds that support academic activities.
The initiative was launched in 2018 as the Presidential Initiative to Celebrate the Impact of the Arts and the Humanities. The first round of projects, 14 in all, was chosen the next year and included an Illinois writer’s festival, theater renovations and the use of virtual reality to teach theatrical performance.
The new projects include:
Africana World Studies at UIUC and UIC, $175,000Teresa Barnes, Maimouna Barro, Mary Gathogo, Erik McDuffie, Tekita Bankhead and Sam Smith (UIUC); and Lynette Jackson and Kirk Hoppe (UIC)The development of a joint Africana World studies project on the UIC and UIUC campuses will help break down long-standing academic silos of African studies and African-American studies. Through a three-semester sequence, the project is expected to lead students to new opportunities for language learning and community engagement, and it will impact the curriculum at both universities. The project leaders anticipate that the primary participants will be undergraduate students.
The Multiethnic Digital Humanities Project, $175,000Mark Canuel, Rhea Ballad-Thrower and Sandra De Groote (UIC)The project will use digital tools and platforms to connect Black studies, Asian studies, Latin American and Latino studies, Native American and Indigenous studies and other key areas. The project leaders plan to build on the success of the Digital Humanities Initiative, which helped transform humanities work and artistic expression with digital research tools and innovative online platforms. By applying digital tools to multiethnic studies, the project will extend their public reach, as well as embracing faculty work from all three universities in the system. Students and faculty also will be exposed to cutting-edge research using digital tools.
American Plumbing: The Canals, Rivers, and Communities that Bridge North and South – Illinois Rivers Project, $175,000Rachel Havrelock (UIC) and Anne-Marie Hanson (UIS)With plans to host a series of events along Illinois’ rivers, this project is designed to increase knowledge about the state’s waterways and bring new voices to issues related to the environment and climate change. The five planned events will showcase local culture and open dialogues about water that allow experts from the U of I System to both teach and learn from the public. Working with partners, project leaders also plan to author stories, record knowledge and design interactive digital features – including an Illinois rivers website – that will later be featured in a series of public events.
Remembering Black Life in Color: Care, Memory, Community and COVID-19, $175,000Gwyneth Milbrath (UIC) and Karen Flynn (UIUC)Project leaders plan to work with organizations such as the Black Metropolis Research Consortium and the Chicago Chapter of the National Black Nurses' Association, recruiting students from a wide range of disciplines to help assemble a history of the human impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Black communities. The project will gather oral interviews and create both digital and portable exhibits for presentation. Project leaders also anticipate that their work will expand the collections of the Midwest
Nursing History Research Center at UIC and reach audiences outside the academy. Cripping the Arts, $175,000Karyn Sandlos (UIC) and Jorge Lucero (UIUC)Cripping the Arts will build an art-focused collaboration to allow students, faculty and disabled community members across the U of I System to take advantage of the well-recognized educational opportunities for people with disabilities at universities in Urbana-Champaign and Chicago. The project will begin with an exhibition in Chicago and Urbana-Champaign that will serve as the launch point for new community partnerships, teacher training and artist residencies. Project leaders plan to transform spaces dedicated to the arts as well as art education and studio practice through new ideas about disability. Students from UIUC and UIC will be involved in all stages of programming.
IC@Illinois: The Illinois Intercultural Competence Initiative, $171,000Elena Delgado (UIUC)Focused on undergraduate students, IC@Illinois intends to make the University of Illinois System a hub for intercultural communication and intercultural studies. The project will use a humanities-centered approach to focus on the trajectories and histories of U.S minority populations, as well as relationships among different cultures. Undergraduates will be able to earn certification in Intercultural Competence, which refers to the ability to interact and function effectively across cultures. Graduate students will have roles, too, contributing to the development of courses, workshops and teaching modules.
Informing and Enabling Illinois' Arts Ecosystem, $164,000Jennifer Novak-Leonard, Andrew Greenlee and Magdalena Novoa (UIUC)This arts-focused project will highlight the impact of the arts in communities around the state, and help identify factors that can better support the arts and artists in different regions. The project intends to help propel the newly launched Arts Impact Initiative within the UIUC College of Fine and Applied Arts in collaboration with the Department of Urban and Regional Planning. The project also will include a series of public forums, along with generating a series of evidence- and data-driven issue briefs and an applied workshop course in Urban and Regional Planning that will pilot curricula that explores how arts and artists are a part of community development.
Luis Alfaro's ""Are You Listening?"": Tragedy, Trauma, and Therapy Mental Health in the Latinx and BIPOC Communities of Illinois, $140,000Young Richard Kim and Christine Dunford (UIC)The project intends to showcase the transformational impact of the arts and humanities, using a residency by the acclaimed playwright Luis Alfaro (who is a University of Southern California associate professor) as a catalyst for students and to draw other artists and audiences to the UIC campus. Alfaro has written numerous plays that have been produced around the country. While the project will be based at UIC, its leaders plan for its reach to extend both into the city of Chicago and to the system’s two other universities in Urbana-Champaign and Springfield through engagement events.
Neverland, or ""Why Are there American Indians in Peter Pan?"": A Collaborative Work on New Theatre, $105,000Gabriel Solis and Terri Ciofalo (UIUC)The project’s leaders plan to produce a new work of theater, “Neverland,” by Madeline Sayet, executive director of the Yale Indigenous Performing Arts Program, in the spring of 2022. Sayet will serve a residency as a guest artist as part of the project. The play will be designed, performed, managed and studied by UIUC students and faculty, leading to the production of undergraduate and graduate research. The goal of this project is to substantially increase knowledge and understanding about Indigenous performance.
Making Our History: Artists Render Lincoln's Legacies, $85,000Graham Peck, Brytton Bjorngaard and Meghan Kessler (UIS)Making Our History will engage the public in Illinois and beyond in American history by using art as a lens for interpretating President Lincoln’s legacy and to spur conversation. Physical and digital exhibits will be created by historians and artists for display at the UIS Visual Arts Gallery, the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library & Museum (ALPLM) and the Springfield Art Association before being donated to the three universities in the system. Project leaders also plan outreach via news media and the ALPLM podcast series, and will work to connect with K-12 teachers as a key audience, encouraging them to bring their students to exhibitions.

        Dear faculty and staff,
As you may have read in this message from President Tim Killeen, the University of Illinois System is moving into this next phase of the pandemic with a requirement that students at all three campuses (Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield) receive a complete course of COVID-19 vaccines before the beginning of the Fall 2021 semester if they are able to do so.
We will be providing you soon with additional information and details about our plan toward this goal. At this time, I am sending this massmail to students to share the principles that will guide the fall semester at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I hope you will also read it, so you are aware of the expectations that will be in place for the Fall 2021 semester.
At this time, there are no plans to require the COVID-19 vaccine for faculty and staff. However, faculty and staff who are not vaccinated will have to continue to wear face coverings and participate in the COVID-19 testing program.
Again, we are still working through many details, and we hope to share more specifics soon. Thank you for your continued patience and understanding as we navigate this next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear undergraduate and graduate students,
As you may have read in this message from President Tim Killeen, the University of Illinois System is moving into this next phase of the pandemic with a requirement that students at all three campuses (Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield) receive a complete course of COVID-19 vaccines before the beginning of the Fall 2021 semester.
We are in full support of President Killeen’s belief that COVID-19 vaccinations provide the best opportunity for our university to return to near-normal operations while still maximizing the safety of all members of our community as this deadly pandemic continues to threaten much of the world. While our university is still working through details of how we will work with you toward this requirement, I’m writing to outline the principles that will guide the fall semester at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign:
For the Fall 2021 semester, it will be required that all students who are able to do so will be fully vaccinated (defined as 14 days after the final dose) with a university-accepted vaccine before beginning the fall semester if they plan to be on campus with no additional health and safety obligations.
Individuals who are not able to be vaccinated and/or who have not had their record submitted and verified will be required to participate in the COVID-19 testing program and to continue wearing a face covering.
The university is following Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) guidance and accepting vaccines currently authorized for emergency use by either the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the World Health Organization. If you are not able to access one of the university-accepted vaccines, you will be able to receive an accepted vaccine upon your arrival to campus.
Students should submit their Vaccination Record Card in the MyMcKinley Portal and have it verified before the beginning of the fall semester. Click here for more information on uploading your Vaccination Record Card.
If you have not been vaccinated for COVID-19 and you are able to do so, you should be vaccinated as soon as possible. Visit vaccines.gov to find available appointments or walk-in hours in your local area.
We acknowledge that some individuals have health conditions or other reasons why they cannot be vaccinated. For those individuals, the COVID-19 testing program and face coverings will continue to be required.
We will soon be providing more detailed information on requirements, policies and expectations for the fall semester, so I ask that you carefully read your messages from the university and from your departments and colleges in the coming weeks.
Our science-based, SHIELD-led testing and tracing ecosystem has allowed unmatched opportunities to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic with a level of confidence that was not available to many other universities. Our SHIELD ecosystem in combination with the availability of accessible and effective vaccines will allow us to have an academic year that feels far more normal.
The CDC has shared data showing that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and fully vaccinated individuals can start to resume most aspects of pre-pandemic life. I am hopeful that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to improve and we are able to use this new policy to provide more freedoms and experiences for you in the coming academic year.
Thank you for your continued patience and understanding as we navigate this next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                June 21, 2021 11:16 AM
			
        Dear students, faculty and staff:
To continue our commitment to collective safety, the University of Illinois System will require that all students receive a COVID-19 vaccination if they plan to be on campus for fall semester 2021. This requirement is consistent with our own scientific modeling of the risks associated with the spread of the virus and its variants. It is also consistent with the Illinois Department of Public Health’s goals.
We recognize that some individuals have health conditions or other reasons why they cannot be vaccinated. That is why it is so important that those of us who can get vaccinated do so. Those who are not vaccinated will need to follow campus-specific guidelines and any exemption protocols issued by each university. Individuals who plan to work or study remotely are exempted from these requirements.
Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, students have helped make the University of Illinois System a model for the nation – a model of community, a model of safety and a model of pulling together for the common good.  We look forward to their help in setting the standard again this fall, a semester that will restore most in-person instruction and many of the other traditional rhythms of campus life that COVID interrupted last year. Widespread vaccinations will help us do that.  
Each university will follow up with additional guidance on vaccination information as well as other safety measures planned for fall. We also will continue to monitor our policies closely, making adjustments as appropriate based on advances in scientific understanding and updated guidance from public health authorities.
Guidelines for faculty and staff are still being developed and will be shared later this summer.
Sincerely,
Tim"

                June 18, 2021 4:34 PM
			
        Dear campus community member,
As part of our commitment to transparency and giving you resources to keep yourself and others safe, we would like to provide information about gun-related violence that has been occurring in off-campus areas of Champaign-Urbana during the first half of this calendar year.
Local law enforcement has shared in community meetings and in the news media that reports of shots fired incidents in the off-campus community have increased in recent months. This follows a disturbing national trend of increasing gun violence. Although our campus has not been directly affected by these incidents to date, these trends take a very real toll on all of Champaign-Urbana. We are distressed by the impact this has on the people in our community, especially families directly affected by gun violence.
We also recognize our role in preventing community violence, and so the University of Illinois Police Department has taken a proactive stance in addressing these public safety issues. Our ongoing multi-jurisdictional partnership in the county’s Street Crimes Task Force continues to be productive in identifying and holding accountable violent offenders, especially those who engage in illegal activity with firearms. Additionally, we are increasing our patrol presence in areas immediately surrounding our campus with officers in vehicles, on bicycles, and on foot. A visible patrol presence like this is an effective way to deter crime.
If we become aware of a specific public safety issue affecting campus, we will notify you in a timely manner.
Even while we are taking proactive steps to address public safety issues, our greatest crime prevention tool will always be your active involvement in protecting yourself and those around you. Here are some things you can do to keep our community safe:
Use SafeWalks. Walking in groups of three or more is the best way to reduce your risk of being targeted by a criminal. If you need to travel on campus after 9 p.m., call 217-333-1216 to request a free walking escort provided by trained members of our Student Patrol or security staff.
Use emergency phones if needed. Dozens of blue emergency phones are strategically located across campus if you need help. The phones are a direct line to University Police and can also be used to request a SafeWalks escort.
Be aware of your surroundings. Take note of things that seem particularly out of the ordinary and consider whether you should take steps to avoid it. Some examples may include leaving an area where people are fighting or taking an alternate route if you identify a potentially dangerous situation. Remember that using your phone or listening to music can distract you from people or vehicles around you.
Report suspicious activity. We all have a good sense of what is normal and what is not. Remember that the police can help only if we know what is going on. It is important to report crime and other suspicious activity so we can investigate and prevent further incidents.
We have always said that the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe place to study, work and socialize. That is still true, but no community is completely crime-free. University Police will continue to take proactive steps to address public safety issues, and we ask that you do as well. Together, we can maintain a safe campus environment where academics, research and public service can flourish.
Sincerely,
Alice Cary
Executive Director of Public Safety and Chief of Police"

        Dear undergraduate and graduate students,  
Starting Monday, June 21, if the Safer Illinois app shows your vaccination record as verified, you will no longer be required to submit a saliva sample regularly for compliance and building access. Please read below for more information and directions for submitting your vaccination information through the McKinley Health Center for verification.
If you were vaccinated anywhere other than the McKinley Health Center or CRCE and have already uploaded your Vaccination Record Card and provided consent:
On Monday, you should receive a status change on your Safer Illinois app that shows your record has been verified. It should also be in place in the Boarding Pass.
Beginning on Monday, you can also check to see if your record has been verified by visiting the Immunizations section of your MyMcKinley Portal. Select “View History” and then click “Print” and there should be a full list of your verified vaccination records.
If you uploaded your card and provided consent and you do not see these changes, please check the following before contacting the Wellness Answer Center:
Has it been at least three weeks since your submission? It can take up to three weeks for the McKinley Health Center to verify your record by confirming it with university and other vaccination databases.
Are you sure you completed your submission? To check, visit the Immunizations section of your MyMcKinley Portal. If it is not displayed there, it may not have been saved, and you may need to submit again.
Did you receive an approved COVID-19 vaccine? For building access and compliance, the university is following CDC guidance and accepting vaccines authorized for emergency use by either the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the World Health Organization. See more information here.
Have you provided a verified English translation if your record is in another language?
Is your Safer Illinois app updated? Do you have your Safer Illinois app set to share your Health Provider Test Result and Vaccine information in your settings?
If you are required to test, you will need to continue to do so until your COVID-19 vaccine record has been verified.

If you have been vaccinated for COVID-19 in the state of Illinois but have not already uploaded your Vaccination Record Card and provided consent:
The state immunization data registry will be used to verify your immunization.
This verification process could take 4-6 weeks, so please be patient.
When your record has been verified, you will receive a status change on your Safer Illinois. It should also be in place in the Boarding Pass.
You can also check to see if your record has been verified by visiting the Immunizations section of your MyMcKinley Portal.

I am delighted that President Biden and Governor Pritzker each signed legislation this week declaring Juneteenth a holiday on both the federal and state levels.
It gives much-deserved respect to one of the most significant dates in our nation’s history – June 19, the date that the last enslaved African-Americans were freed in Texas in 1865. It will also heighten education on the importance of the holiday and continue moving us closer to the social equity and justice that our country must achieve.
We are excited to add this to our holiday schedule for June 2022. Details about the observed date will be forthcoming.
I hope you will all join me in applauding our leadership in Washington and Springfield for giving us a chance to reflect and recommit to the goals of equality and justice that we all share.

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
As you know, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has announced that the State of Illinois will move into Phase 5 of the Restore Illinois plan tomorrow, Friday, June 11. I’m writing to share guidance about what this will mean for our university community:
Classrooms during Summer Session 2021
Summer in-person classes will continue to require students and faculty to wear facial coverings and practice social distancing when they are in the classroom during the class period.
Classrooms during Fall 2021 
The university is still considering what this new guidance will mean for Fall 2021 classes. We will announce more details in the coming weeks.
Face Coverings/Social Distancing
Based on CDC guidance, faculty, staff and students who are fully vaccinated (defined as 14 days after final dose) are not required to wear a face covering or practice social distancing in university spaces except for healthcare settings or facilities that operate under additional federal and state regulations. See more information here.
People who are not fully vaccinated are required to wear a face covering in university spaces indoors, as well as outdoors when they cannot practice social distancing.
University Facilities
The new Phase 5 guidance replaces industry-specific guidance from the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO). There are no longer limits on space capacity, etc. See more information here.
University spaces that serve the university community or the public may open or continue to be open, as long as they have updated signage to indicate that people who are not fully vaccinated are required to wear a face covering in university spaces.
Compliance
At this time, compliance will be enforced on the honor system, and we expect you to be honest as we seek to protect each other’s well-being.
In order to implement COVID-related guidelines and policies affecting university operations, supervisors may ask employees if they are fully vaccinated.
Supervisors may not ask employees why they are not vaccinated or ask any other questions seeking the employee’s personal health information.
COVID-19 Testing
For now, all COVID-19 testing requirements are still in place. If you live in University Housing or are participating in on-campus activities, you should continue your on-campus COVID-19 testing schedule, even if you are fully vaccinated.
In the future, the university plans to use an individual’s verified Vaccination Record Card to replace regular COVID-19 testing for compliance and building access. When this new policy goes into effect, we will send another announcement.
We encourage members of the university community to be vaccinated if and when they are able to do so. If you have not been vaccinated and you want to make an appointment, please find information on the university’s COVID-19 website. We also acknowledge that some individuals have health conditions or other reasons why they cannot be vaccinated.
The university will continue to take guidance on COVID-19 safety protocols from the CDC, IDPH, CUPHD and our own SHIELD team. We will continue to monitor the status and spread of COVID-19 on our campus and be prepared to pivot our approach if necessary.
We are at a critical period of the COVID-19 pandemic, when we need to demonstrate our commitment to one another by being honest and compassionate. Thank you for continuing to make decisions that maximize the safety of our entire community.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear faculty, staff, students and friends:
Over the holiday weekend, the Illinois legislature approved a budget for the coming fiscal year that would hold state appropriations at current-year levels for the University of Illinois System. The proposed budget will be sent to Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who is expected to sign it into law.
It marks the second straight year that legislators and the governor have maintained funding despite the financial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we are grateful to them for investing in higher education and its power to move Illinois forward.
The $42.3 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 also re-appropriates capital funding to support key construction projects. That includes funding for development of our Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) and Illinois Innovation Network (IIN), along with major projects at each of our universities.
Highlights of the budget include:
An appropriation of $622 million for operations, matching state funding for the current fiscal year.
Re-appropriation of capital funding for planning and construction of DPI and 15 IIN research hubs across the state, including one at each of our universities and satellite campuses. Overall, the state has committed $500 million for the projects, and released about $142 million late last year in the first round of funding.
Re-appropriation of $807 million to fund capital improvements at all three universities. Major projects include renovation of Altgeld Hall for a math, statistics and data science collaboration center in Urbana-Champaign; a quantum sciences initiative that Urbana is developing in partnership with the University of Chicago, Argonne and FermiLab; the Advanced Chemical Technical Building at UIC and a computer design research and learning center for UIC’s College of Engineering; and a new facility at UIS that will replace the existing library, along with a new Public Safety Building.
Appropriation of $65 million in new capital funding to expand patient-care services at the University of Illinois Hospital. One crucial project will create a new clinical decision unit, or CDU, adjacent to the hospital’s emergency room to rapidly screen and test incoming patients. The unit will identify patients most at risk of issues such as heart attack, stroke or infectious disease, including COVID, allowing rapid, life-saving treatment and isolation to prevent spread of disease. The funding will also support much-needed upgrades of the hospital’s 42-year-old emergency room to meet today’s patient needs and expand the Cancer Care Center to make it a multi-specialty clinic.
Appropriation of $8 million to support the world’s largest carbon capture research program at City Water Light and Power in Springfield. Our Prairie Research Institute will be part of the $67 million U.S. Department of Energy study on how to decrease carbon emissions into the atmosphere.
A $28 million funding increase for the Monetary Award Program (MAP), which provides financial aid to support Illinois students, including thousands at our three universities.
The legislature also approved funding at current levels for the fourth year of a state scholarship program created to encourage in-state students to attend college in Illinois and stem an outmigration of talent to other states. The U of I System and other universities provide matching funds to double the impact of the state’s contribution.
The U of I System advocated for increased funding to support a flagship university system that has set enrollment records for eight straight years and has played a key role in helping the state navigate the COVID crisis. But we understand the financial challenges the pandemic has created and the shared sacrifice that is required to pave the way to recovery. We will resume our push for additional funding next year – funding that is essential to ensure faculty hiring keeps pace with growing enrollment and maintains the academic excellence that our students expect.
We are grateful to Gov. Pritzker, the legislature and our U of I Caucus for their support during this budget process, and to all of you for everything you do to make the U of I System a key engine of progress for the people of Illinois.

        Dear faculty, staff and students,  We are pleased to share that testing for University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign families and households will now be free at the State Farm Center testing site through SHIELD CU. This change is part of a partnership effort that will make the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign’s COVID-19 saliva test more widely available and free to community members. More details on this effort are forthcoming. Testing through SHIELD CU is funded through an agreement between the Illinois Department of Public Health and University of Illinois System.
Changes to SHIELD CU testing for university families and households
Starting immediately, testing at the State Farm Center is available free of charge to university families and households.
University family and household members who have already tested at the State Farm Center through SHIELD CU in April and May will not be billed for their tests.
Parents or legal guardians must accompany minors (ages 8-17) and complete a paper consent form at the testing site the first time a minor tests. Minors who have previously tested through SHIELD CU will also need to complete a one-time paper consent form.
Faculty, staff and students are no longer required to provide authorization for their family or household members to test. Participants are encouraged to register using the Safer Community app before testing. Please note the Safer Community App is a different app than the Safer Illinois app used for university employees and students.
All individuals who have previously joined the University of Illinois employee family member group in the Safer Community App will receive an app notification that states “Testing is now free in Champaign, you have been removed from the family member group.” After selecting “Continue,” the user will proceed with the testing process as usual.  
SHIELD CU testing hours at the State Farm Center will remain the same. Hours are currently Tuesday, Thursday and Friday: 8 – 11:30 a.m. and noon – 4 p.m., Saturday: 8 a.m. – noon, Sunday: 10 a.m. – 2 p.m. Hours are subject to change, so please continue to check osfhealthcare.org/shield-cu. 
All University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign faculty, staff, and students participating in any on-campus activities must continue to test at on-campus COVID-19 testing locations.

                May 14, 2021 4:01 PM
			
        Dear faculty, staff and students,
As you likely have heard, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced yesterday that fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a face covering or practice social distancing. The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) has indicated that it will be revising state guidance to align with these changes.
While this is encouraging news, I also want to be clear that the COVID-19 pandemic has not ended, and we all need to continue to make decisions that maximize the safety of our entire community.
As the State of Illinois moves towards the anticipated June 11 transition to Phase 5 of the Restore Illinois COVID-response, many of our own COVID-19 rules and policies will remain in place.
At this point, all students, faculty and staff who live in University Housing or are participating in any on-campus activities are still required to be up-to-date on their on-campus COVID-19 testing. This is currently in place even for people who are fully vaccinated. As previously announced, this will change for the Fall 2021 semester. 
Here are some immediate university changes:
Effective immediately, the university no longer will require fully vaccinated people to wear face coverings or practice social distancing indoors or outdoors, except as noted below. Please note the definition of “fully vaccinated” is 14 days after final dose.
People who are not fully vaccinated will be required to wear a face covering and practice social distancing indoors and outdoors.
At this time, compliance with this new CDC guidance will be enforced on the honor system, and we are asking you to be honest with one another. In order to implement COVID-related guidelines and policies affecting university operations, supervisors may ask employees if they are fully vaccinated. Supervisors may not ask employees why they are not vaccinated or ask any other questions seeking the employee’s personal health information. 
Out of an abundance of caution in this new stage of the pandemic response, students, staff and faculty attending in-person classes for the Summer 2021 semester will be required to continue to wear face coverings and practice social distancing in instructional spaces. We are still considering what this new guidance will mean for Fall 2021 classes and other operations and activities.
Based on IDPH guidance, healthcare settings will continue to require people to wear face coverings and practice social distancing. McKinley Health Center will follow this guidance where appropriate.
We encourage members of the university community to be vaccinated if and when they are able to do so. If you have not been vaccinated and you want to make an appointment, please continue to check your university email for available appointments via massmails and check local pharmacy appointments at vaccinefinder.org.
We also acknowledge that some individuals have health conditions or other reasons why they cannot be vaccinated. Some fully vaccinated individuals may also choose to continue practicing social distancing and wearing face coverings. I encourage you to all be mindful of this as people make their individual choices.
We will continue to monitor the status and spread COVID-19 on our campus and be prepared to pivot our approach if necessary. We will also continue to take guidance on COVID-19 safety protocols from the CDC, IDPH, the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) and our own SHIELD team.
We are working quickly to update our existing resources with guidance and information. And in the coming days and weeks, we will continue to provide more information about any further adjustments or changes to our operations and policies. I ask everyone for your continued patience as we navigate this newest phase. If you have questions about any of these new changes, you can always email COVID-19@illinois.edu.
We have clearly reached a new milestone and all of us are hopeful that we are finally starting to see light at the end of this tunnel here in our community. But COVID-19 remains a significant threat to safety and to our society. We have gotten to this point because all of you have made the difficult choices along the way that prioritized the health and safety of your friends, colleagues, family members and the surrounding community. That commitment to one another and that collaborative and compassionate spirit are points of great pride for this entire university. You have my thanks and my greatest admiration.
I ask that we all continue to demonstrate that commitment and that care as we move into this summer of change and transition.
Sincerely
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear colleagues: I am pleased to announce the authorization of a 2 percent, merit-based salary program for faculty, academic professional and civil service staff across the University of Illinois System, effective August 16, 2021.
This program was a top priority in our budget planning to enable much-deserved recognition for employees who received no increases this year due to the financial fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In addition, our three universities have been asked to establish their own guidelines for separate programs to address compression, market, equity and retention issues. Commitments for existing contractual agreements, promotions and equity adjustments will also be honored as part of this program. I have asked chancellors to monitor carefully any individual increases amounting to more than 7 percent at their universities and I will do the same at the system level.
Pay adjustments for faculty and staff in bargaining units will be determined by negotiations with the bargaining representative and/or applicable contract settlements, and are not subject to unilateral adjustments unless authorized or permitted pursuant to the collective bargaining process. 
I hope that the salary program, announced today, serves to illustrate just how much we value your hard work and sacrifice during the ongoing COVID crisis. Thanks to you, a year of historic challenges has also seen one of our greatest triumphs over adversity. You have made the U of I System a model for the nation, sustaining our world-class teaching and research while dealing with the many unique challenges that the pandemic brought to our institution and to your own lives and families.
You are the foundation of our excellence, and I am deeply grateful for your hard work, your flexibility and creativity, your dedication and your loyalty. Sincerely,  Tim"

As planning for Fall 2021 instruction begins, we are presented with the opportunity to reflect on all that we have learned over the last year about teaching and engaging students across different course modalities. We are pleased to announce the Illinois Summer Teaching Institute, an opportunity for faculty to review good practice, discuss different pedagogical approaches with colleagues and receive hands-on training. The focus of this year’s institute is on enhancing instruction through the use of multimodal approaches, innovative assessments and strategies for increasing student engagement. Here are some of the highlights:
Participants will design their fall courses in a community of fellow instructors with the support of faculty experts and campus experts from CITL, Tech Services and college-level educational technology units.
The institute will be delivered via Canvas from June 7 through June 27. Webinar recordings and other content will be available in Canvas to all instructors beginning in July. 
The institute will include twenty-four 30-minute webinars, asynchronous content and assignments that will build toward a completed fall syllabus.
Sample webinar topics include multimodal course design, easy interventions for improved engagement across modalities and high frequency/low stakes assessments.
Opportunities for one-on-one help will be offered both during and after the institute.
Details on eligibility, sign-up and compensation will be available soon through your department or college. 
Thank you for considering this opportunity to receive expert support in your fall course preparations.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

                May 12, 2021 12:01 PM
			
        Dear faculty and staff,
As you know, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker recently announced that the State of Illinois will move from Phase 4 to a Bridge to Phase 5 (Bridge Phase) on Friday, May 14. The biggest implication of this new guidance for the university community is that this expands capacity for events and spaces. We will follow the IDPH guidance in the “Bridge” column of this document.
Affected university spaces/events include:
Dining
Fitness facilities
Office spaces
Retail spaces
Festivals/outdoor spectator events
Conferences
Museums
Social events
Indoor spectator events
Outdoor spectator events
Please keep in mind that this will not change space or capacity guidelines already in place for Summer 2021 in-person classes.
For questions or concerns on how to interpret or implement these new expansions of capacity limits, please email covid-plan-review@illinois.edu.
Moving into the Bridge Phase is good news for our entire community, but we must continue to be as diligent as ever in safety precautions, including getting vaccinated if you are able, participating in regular COVID-19 testing, wearing face coverings, practicing social distancing, washing your hands frequently and avoiding large gatherings.
Mandatory on-campus testing requirements are still in place for people living in University Housing facilities or participating in any on-campus activities.
Even as we look forward to moving into Phase 5, which the governor said could happen as early as June 11, maximizing the health, safety and wellness of our entire community will continue to be a top priority. For the Fall 2021 semester, even if we are in Phase 5, we anticipate that the university will continue to require regular COVID-19 testing (except for those with a verified vaccination record). The university will also continue to require face coverings, social distancing, etc. aligned with IDPH guidelines for Phase 5.
We know frequent changes can be disruptive to you, so we intend to keep the current classroom assignments, capacity limits and course modality in place for all in-person classes during the Fall 2021 semester. Changes to in-person classes may be considered if COVID-19 conditions worsen and require more restrictive measures.
Thank you in advance for your patience and understanding as we work through this next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. I am grateful for your spirit, your resilience and your commitment to taking care of our community.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

Please see below for the updated travel guidance and requirements from Illinois Human Resources. This information is also available on the travel page of the university’s COVID-19 website.
The Office of the Provost has issued new guidance for student trip travel related to courses or learning experiences. See this guidance here.
The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation has issued new guidance for research travel. See the ""guidance for research-related travel"" section of the OVCRI website here.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost
Updated Travel Guidance 
International Travel
International travel on behalf of the university should only be approved for essential reasons when the objective of the travel cannot effectively be accomplished virtually. It requires approval by the respective Executive Officer (dean, vice provost, vice chancellor, etc.), and will be informed by the U.S. Department of State and CDC guidance on international travel advisories.
Domestic Travel
According to the CDC, the COVID-19 vaccine facilitates safer travel opportunities as fully vaccinated travelers are less likely to get and spread COVID-19. The CDC has issued guidance that states individuals who are fully vaccinated with an FDA-authorized vaccine can travel safely within the United States. 
This allows the university to relax some of the restriction on domestic university business travel. As of today, travel on behalf of the university will no longer need additional approvals, other than the standard approvals required pre-COVID (before March 2020). 
Please note the following guidance is applicable whether the travel is personal or university-sponsored business travel.
General Guidance for University Travelers
Assess the COVID-19 situation at your destination prior to departure to ensure travel to the location can be safely managed. This is particularly important if you are considering international travel as the restrictions are very fluid.
When possible, delay travel until you are fully vaccinated, which is two weeks after the second dose of a 2-dose series such as Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech, or 2 weeks after receiving a single dose vaccine, such as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
Maintain your university testing schedule prior to travel. Do not travel if you are ill or have tested positive for COVID-19. If you are not fully vaccinated, do not travel if still awaiting COVID-19 test results.
If you are not fully vaccinated, ensure that you test 48 hours before your departure and with enough time to receive your results before travel begins.
When traveling, continue to follow the CDC’s recommendations to:
Wear a face covering over your nose and mouth
Stay six feet from others and avoid crowds
Wash your hands often or use hand sanitizer
Monitor for any symptoms and quarantine if you suspect that you have COVID-19
Follow all country, state or local recommendations and requirements
Approval for business travel requests may be rescinded at any time up until the date that travel begins, particularly if the COVID-19 situation at your destination suddenly changes. Remember, face coverings are required. Face coverings are required on public transportation such as planes, buses and trains, when traveling into, within or out of the United States and in U.S. transportation hubs such as airports and stations, as well as at many venues and events.
After Travel
Fully vaccinated individuals do not need to self-quarantine after travel. Resume your university testing schedule, testing as soon as possible upon return.
Travelers who are NOT fully vaccinated need to self-quarantine for 7 days and get tested 3-5 days after your return.

                April 30, 2021 5:02 PM
			
        Dear colleagues:
I write to share the bittersweet news that Executive Vice President and Vice President for Academic Affairs Barb Wilson has been named the 22nd president of the University of Iowa, effective July 15.
It is a wonderful and richly deserved opportunity that will keep Barb just across the border, at a nationally ranked, Big Ten research university much like the one in Urbana-Champaign where she first joined us as a faculty member in 2000.
Ever since, her talents and passion have been lifting our students and our universities. She moved into campus-wide leadership in the provost’s office in 2009 and became the Harry E. Preble Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences in 2014. Later, she served for more than a year as interim chancellor in Urbana-Champaign, where she helped grow enrollment and programs despite the financial shortfalls of a state budget impasse.
In 2016, as Robert Jones was preparing to join us as chancellor, I named Barb as the University of Illinois System’s inaugural executive vice president. She has set the standard for excellence in the new role, helping lead efforts that include tuition freezes, increases in institutional financial aid, expanding our ranks of world-class faculty, establishing policies to promote safe and welcoming campus communities and shepherding a much-needed update of university statutes.
But as much as her many accomplishments, we will remember her warmth and kindness, her thoughtfulness and compassion, and her optimism and good humor. She has been an invaluable colleague and a deeply valued advisor and friend throughout my years here, and I know so many of you share those same feelings.
The news release below will be sent to media later today and I will update you as we develop plans to fill her position on an interim basis and to begin the search for a permanent successor.
In the meantime, I hope you will all join me in thanking Barb for her extraordinary service and wishing her and her husband, John Lammers, the very best in this exciting new chapter in their lives.
Sincerely,Tim
April 30, 2021
Barbara J. Wilson named president of the University of IowaSearch will begin to fill her current role as second-in-command of U of I System
Barbara J. Wilson, a longtime University of Illinois faculty member and administrator who has served as second-in-command of the U of I System since 2016, was unanimously approved as president of the University of Iowa today by the Board of Regents.
Wilson, currently executive vice president and vice president for academic affairs for the three-university U of I System, will take office July 15 as Iowa’s 22nd president. She will replace Bruce Harreld, who is stepping down in May after five years as president.
U of I System President Tim Killeen said an interim vice president will be named soon and will serve during a national search to fill Wilson’s current role as second-in-command, senior operating officer and chief academic officer of Illinois’ flagship university system.
“Barb’s talents and leadership are matched by her kindness, compassion and a rare ability to relate and connect with everyone,” Killeen said. “I am so sorry to see her go, but so grateful for her many contributions to our students, our universities and our excellence. I wish her the very best as she moves on to this new, richly deserved opportunity.”
Wilson, 63, first joined the faculty in 2000 at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), a peer institution of Iowa’s as a top-tier public research university and member of the Big Ten Conference.
She was interim chancellor of the 50,000-student UIUC campus in 2015-16, and earlier served as the Harry E. Preble Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences in Urbana-Champaign. Before becoming dean, she served as executive vice provost for faculty and academic affairs at UIUC, with a leadership role in campus strategic and financial planning. 
In 2016, Killeen named her to the newly restructured role of executive vice president and vice president for academic affairs. The position established a clear No. 2 executive to the president and added responsibilities as senior operating officer to traditional duties as chief academic officer.
Wilson worked closely with Killeen to advocate for the U of I System and elevate its national profile by building on connections with legislators, funding agencies and leaders in higher education, communities and industry.
Among her many achievements, she has helped plan and coordinate the system’s $6.7 billion operating budget, led an initiative that has added two dozen nationally recognized faculty members, and helped guide efforts that have held down tuition, increased institutional financial aid and pushed enrollment over 90,000 students for the first time last fall.
A professor of communication who was a member of the faculty at the University of California at Santa Barbara for 12 years, Wilson is an elected fellow of the International Communication Association. A three-degree alumna of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Wilson earned a bachelor’s degree in journalism and her master’s degree and Ph.D in communication.
###
The University of Illinois System is a world leader in research and discovery, and the largest educational institution in the state with more than 90,000 students, about 26,000 full-time equivalent faculty and staff, and universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield. The U of I System awards more than 23,000 undergraduate, graduate and professional degrees annually."

                April 29, 2021 11:01 AM
			
        Dear faculty, staff and students,
In the future, the university plans to use an individual’s verified proof of being fully vaccinated (defined as 14 days after final dose) to replace regular COVID-19 testing for compliance and building access. This is a science-based recommendation from the Shield team based on what the vaccine research has shown so far.
This is expected to be in place before Aug. 23, the first day of the Fall 2021 semester. It is possible it could be available earlier – sometime this summer. When this new policy goes into effect, we will send another announcement. Individuals who do not submit vaccination records will continue to be required to participate in the COVID-19 on-campus testing program.
Please note that until this goes into effect, all university COVID-19 testing requirements will remain. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action.
If you are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, we encourage you to upload your COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card to the MyMcKinley Portal by taking a few simple steps. Please note if you received both vaccine doses at CRCE, you do not need to upload your record.
How to upload your COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card
Log into the MyMcKinley Portal: https://mymckinley.illinois.edu
Click on the “Forms” button in the menu header.
Choose “COVID-19 Vaccine Record Consent.”
Fill out the form.
Upload a photo of your completed COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card. (A cell phone image is fine.)
Click submit.
Note: International Vaccine Records require a certified English translation.
After you submit, the McKinley Health Center staff will verify the accuracy of your vaccine record. Once the upload has been reviewed and approved, your COVID-19 vaccines will appear under the Immunizations tab in your MyMcKinley Portal. Uploaded cards will be reviewed by mid-summer. If you have any issues, please email the COVID Wellness Answer Center at covidwellness@illinois.edu or call 217-333-1900.
If you have not been vaccinated and you want to make an appointment, please continue to check your university email for available appointments via massmails and check local pharmacy appointments at vaccinefinder.org. We encourage members of the university community to be vaccinated if and when they are able to do so. We also acknowledge that some individuals have health conditions or other reasons why they cannot be vaccinated.
Please note that we anticipate that all other COVID-19 guidelines will be in place, including wearing face coverings and practicing social distancing. We will continue to monitor COVID-19 on our campus and be prepared to pivot our approach if necessary. In the future, if we believe the science indicates that vaccinated individuals should continue testing, we will shift and mandate testing even for vaccinated individuals.
We will also continue to take guidance on COVID-19 safety protocols from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD).
Maximizing the health and safety of our entire community will continue to be our top priority, and we are optimistic that the coming months will bring more signs that the spread of COVID-19 is diminishing. Thank you for your continued patience and understanding as we continue to navigate this new phase of the pandemic together.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

Dear Illinois colleagues, 
In the two months since the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign announced the adoption of Canvas as its campus-wide, unified Learning Management System (LMS), campus leadership, eLearning professionals, and the Canvas Advisory and Steering Committees have been working diligently on behind-the-scenes preparations. We are excited to update you on the new resources available on the Canvas Transition Website, what you can do now to prepare to migrate your course(s), and what’s next. 
Updates to the Canvas Transition Website include: 
More in-depth information on the three different methods for migrating your courses—blank shell, manual migration, and automatic migration—and the pros and cons of each. 
Training opportunities, including summer workshops; online video resources; a self-paced Canvas 101 Faculty Orientation course covering the basics; online, subscription-based workshops and training resources offered through Canvas; and more. 
Charts comparing Blackboard to Canvas and Moodle to Canvas.
A features chart highlighting some of the top features you can use now to assist you with your content delivery and classroom structure. 
Instructions to Request a Canvas Development Space. 
Here are some things you can do now: 
Visit the Training Calendar and sign up for a “Building Courses in Canvas” workshop this summer. If you can’t attend a workshop, you can view recordings of previous sessions, review self-paced documentation, or request a consultation.   
Begin considering migration methods. If you want to get started now, you can use the blank shell or manual migration options. If you’re interested in automated migration, we recommend that you hang back and wait for more information, coming next month. 
Request a Canvas Development Space to use as a sandbox or explore building your course now. 
Next month, we will provide information on: 
Timeline and expectations for automatic migrations 
Using templates 
More useful features in Canvas 
Please remember that although Compass will be available until June 2022, we encourage you to begin using Canvas as early as possible to give yourself more time to adapt to the new learning platform. As a bonus, your students will spend less time juggling courses over multiple platforms. We also encourage you to subscribe to the Canvas mailing list to receive future updates about Canvas migration plans.
If you have any questions, please contact us. We want to help make your transition as smooth as possible! 
Sincerely, Canvas Steering Committee"

        Dear students, faculty and staff:
The University of Illinois System welcomes President Biden’s publicly announced commitment to action on climate change, a serious and essential statement of the country’s resolve to lead in building a better, more sustainable future.
President Biden’s new plan to, among other things, cut U.S. emissions in half by 2030 also represents a call to the country’s centers of research and innovation for the bold ideas needed to make these goals reality.
The University of Illinois System and its three universities stand ready to help.
We bring to this endeavor a lengthy history of game-changing innovation and service as a willing partner with government in the kinds of collaborations that will animate President Biden’s vision.
Among our Guiding Principles that define the bedrock of the U of I System’s core values is a commitment to environmental sustainability. It is part of a greater accountability we have to individuals and communities on not just our campuses, but across Illinois, the nation and the world.
This Guiding Principle states, in part: “We will make the most of the U of I System’s wide-ranging and ever-evolving talents, encouraging collaborations among disciplines to produce not just breakthroughs, but sustainable environmental and economic improvements to the human condition.”
The U of I System and its universities have spearheaded so many breakthroughs that have helped drive the technological revolution, the world-class educational opportunities that have transformed lives and, over the past year, the ingenuity and innovation that have kept our research and educational enterprises thriving under the stress of a pandemic.
President Biden’s climate commitment presents another moment of both opportunity and obligation, one we are well-positioned and eager to meet.
Sincerely,
Tim Killeen, President, University of Illinois SystemBarb Wilson, Executive Vice President and Vice President for Academic Affairs, U of I SystemAvijit Ghosh, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, U of I SystemJay Walsh, Interim Vice President for Economic Development and Innovation, U of I SystemRobert J.

                April 20, 2021 4:32 PM
			
        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
We hope today’s jury decision gives Mr. Floyd’s family some small sense of closure and a measure of justice. But no court can reverse his senseless death. And no verdict will erase their grief, anger and loss. Our thoughts are with his family and friends today.
Our collective compassion for those who are in pain must be equally matched by an urgent, firm, sustained public commitment to take action. As a university, as a community, as a nation and as individuals of conscience, we must fully and permanently dismantle the conditions of systemic racism and social injustice that play out so disastrously and disproportionately for too many families of people of color on a daily basis in our country.
While George Floyd’s death has catalyzed the necessary and urgent national reckoning on racial inequity, policing and the fundamental fairness of our justice system, our nation has seen other moments of reckoning that we have yet to heed, including the police killing of Eric Garner who uttered the words “I can’t breathe” nearly seven years ago. The deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Daunte Wright, Adam Toledo and too many others this past year alone are the unacceptable consequence of our current system of policing and criminal justice. Their deaths cannot be dismissed as isolated incidents or individual acts – they are clear and painful evidence that we are facing an embedded, societal crisis that we must directly and fundamentally address. Change will not happen without unrelenting effort.
As a part of our university’s Call to Action to Address Racism and Social Injustice launched in the wake of this year’s racialized violence, we are engaged in an active review of the role our own university has played in creating these systems, the histories that we have failed to address and the public safety processes and policies we have in place. Today we state unequivocally that we are ready to invest the resources, the time and the necessary effort to repair this damage and to reimagine and rebuild these systems. We are committed to making the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign a community where our research, engagement, equity, inclusion and leadership practices actively work to dismantle systems that utilize power, privilege and violence to disenfranchise and diminish, so that we can recognize the full humanity and lives of Black and Brown students, faculty and staff. This summer we will begin to bring the working group recommendations to the broader university community. These listening sessions will help us discuss the paths forward that we together will choose to prioritize through a collaborative process. We will provide more information about these sessions in the coming months, which will continue into the fall to allow all students who wish to participate an opportunity to share their perspectives.
This year, we have learned the names of too many, like George Floyd, who were taken in senseless ways. It is important that we remember them by committing to take actions that put an end to the systemic and embedded conditions that cost so many lives and bring such profound harm to the families and communities who are left behind. It is long past time.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

The Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) has alerted us that there are a select number of Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine appointments for tomorrow and Friday available in Livingston County, about an hour away, for any individuals 18 years of age or older. The clinic is being run by the National Guard, and the Illinois Department of Public Health has asked that we share with our students.
Please note mandatory testing requirements are still in place for individuals who are fully vaccinated.
Appointments
Vaccinations will be done by appointment only.

We encourage members of the university community to be vaccinated if and when they are able to do so. We also acknowledge that some individuals have health conditions or other reasons why they cannot be vaccinated. See here for more guidance about vaccination status.
If you are not able to make an appointment in this round, please be patient as vaccine supply is still somewhat limited. We will send another message when CUPHD has more vaccine appointments available. As a reminder, the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District is leading vaccination distribution for our county. The university shares information from CUPHD when it is relevant to faculty, staff or students. The university does not control the vaccine appointments, timelines or community clinic locations.
The distribution of a vaccine is welcome news, but we must continue to be as diligent as ever in safety precautions, including regular COVID-19 testing, wearing face coverings, social distancing, hand washing and avoiding large gatherings.

                April 7, 2021 8:17 AM
			
        Dear faculty, staff and students, 
We are pleased to invite members of your family and households to participate in COVID-19 testing through SHIELD CU beginning this Thursday, April 8. 
The previous program launch was delayed due to an unexpected minor technical issue with the Safer Community app. The issue has been fixed for both Apple and Android users. Several successful tests have now been performed, and we are pleased to extend testing at the State Farm Center to all family and household members of faculty, staff and students 8 years of age and older. 
SHIELD CU details for university family members
Family members must download, sign up and use the Safer Community app to be tested and receive results. Please make sure your family members use the latest version of the app.
Family members must enter the UIN of their university sponsor (faculty, staff or student) when prompted in the Safer Community app. The sponsor must then verify the relationship using their Safer Illinois app. This must be done before testing.
The cost will be $10 per test administered to a family or household member. The total for all tests administered to all family members will be charged to the university sponsor once per month. No fee will be charged for invalid tests.
Family members can only be tested at select lines designated for SHIELD CU at the State Farm Center testing site during designated hours. Hours are currently Tuesday, Thursday and Friday: 8 – 11:30 a.m. and noon – 4 p.m., Saturday: 8 a.m. – noon, Sunday: 10 a.m. – 2 p.m. Hours are subject to change, so please continue to check the website.
Tests are processed separately from campus testing. Please plan with the understanding that test results may take up to 48 hours.
University family members may begin testing on Thursday, April 8. 
Complete details, including FAQs about insurance coverage and travel, can be found at shieldcu.illinois.edu.
As always, thank you for your patience and participation as we work to maximize the safety of our community through the SHIELD CU program.

The Urbana campus will test its emergency notification system at 10:05 a.m. on Tuesday, April 6.
All campus community members are encouraged to sign up for Illini-Alert text messages to receive prompt notification of campus emergencies. You can do so by visiting http://emergency.illinois.edu. Contact information for friends and relatives may be added at http://go.illinois.edu/illinialertmyfamily. Anyone else can sign up by texting ""IlliniAlert"" to 226787.
The test of the Illini-Alert system will use all of the communication capabilities of the emergency notification system:
Email messages will be sent to all active faculty and staff members and students with campus email addresses.
Text messages will be sent to those people who have registered their cellphone numbers.  
A message will be sent to the Illini-Alert Twitter account (http://twitter.com/illinialert).
A message will appear on all digital signs connected to the Illini-Alert system.

Last week, we sent a message announcing the launch of SHIELD CU and inviting family and household members of University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign faculty, staff and students to begin testing at the State Farm Center on April 2.
We are currently experiencing an unexpected minor technical issue with the Safer Community App, preventing family members with Android devices from being able to enroll in the program. The app provider has identified the issue and we expect it will be corrected within a day or two. Apple users and anyone already registered in the program are clear to test, but new Android users will need to watch for the new version of the app and download it before testing.
To ensure the best experience for your family and household members, we are delaying the program launch until a later date.
As always, thank you for your patience and understanding as we work to maximize the safety of our community through the SHIELD CU program.

        Dear faculty and staff,
As we navigate the remaining challenges of COVID-19, we are confident that our SHIELD safety protocols, the State of Illinois’ mitigation efforts and the increased availability of the vaccine will allow us to operate the Fall 2021 semester in ways that will continue to provide the experience that undergraduate students, in-residence graduate students, faculty, staff and others anticipated when they chose Illinois. COVID-19 has challenged us to develop new ways of providing basic instruction, student services, research collaborations and administrative support functions. We will draw on that experience as we return to in-person instruction, advising, student support, large-scale student events and research. We must all work together to deliver the world-class Illinois experience our students and other stakeholders expect. To that end, we have re-engaged our Return to Campus Operations work teams, who will finalize operational details by the end of this spring semester.
Planning for Academic Year 21-22
Based on our understanding of current public health guidance, we expect that by fall, COVID-19 health risks to our faculty, staff and students will be greatly minimized. Assuming that current projections of large-scale vaccinations and decreased infection rates are realized, our expectation is that campus will be safe for in-person service by the start of AY21-22.
This should allow the vast majority of faculty, staff and student employees who have been working remotely to return to campus.
We anticipate that local K-12 schools and daycare centers will be open, removing a significant challenge for many of our university community members in transitioning back to campus.
In anticipation of a return to in-person instruction and other activities in Academic Year 21-22, our Return to Campus Operations teams are revising and developing new processes, policies and guidelines in areas such as business, IT, HR, space utilization, operations and research.
This work complements our operational excellence initiative and will guide us in re-envisioning our workforce in ways that support a world-class, research-focused residential university fulfilling its land-grant mission.
This policy does not affect new or existing accommodations for a disability or medical condition. Such accommodations will continue to be handled by the Office for Access and Equity (OAE) under CAM policy HR-67. The ADA division of the Office of Access and Equity can be contacted via phone number at 217-333-0885 or more information can be found at oae.illinois.edu.
For AY 21-22, staff who have a need to initiate or continue remote work options not associated with a disability or personal health condition must work with their unit and submit a telecommuting request for approval. NOTE: We are not asking for new or updated Telecommuting Agreements at this time.
A new single, campus-wide electronic telecommuting request is being finalized and Illinois Human Resources (IHR) will provide more information prior to the start of AY21-22. Not every request for remote work will be granted. If a request for remote work cannot be granted, IHR can assist units and employees with the various leave options available.
Please click here for a summary of our AY21-22 guidance to shape your planning efforts.
Our goal is to provide students the experience they envisioned when they chose Illinois, to provide scholars the collaborative settings they need to conduct their work and to share the knowledge created at this university with the state, the nation and the world. While some of that work can be done remotely, we can leverage our strengths and serve our stakeholders best when we are able to access our facilities and our connections to each other in person. These efforts will be a key pillar of our organization for the next 150 years, and, together, we will continue to fulfill our land-grant mission of learning, discovery and engagement.

                April 1, 2021 9:10 AM
			
        Dear faculty and staff,
Currently the university is not requiring employees to be vaccinated for COVID-19. We encourage members of the university community to be vaccinated if and when they are able to do so. We also acknowledge that some individuals have health conditions or other reasons why they cannot be vaccinated.
Employees may be asked about their vaccination status as part of contact tracing efforts. All employees are directed to cooperate with these efforts in order to identify and reduce infection risks for members of our campus community or the surrounding area.
In addition, there may be aspects of campus operations that make it relevant for supervisors to ask employees to voluntarily disclose their vaccination status.
For example, state and federal health officials recently issued guidelines pertaining to fully vaccinated individuals that relax certain requirements for quarantine, interactions in groups, venue capacity and travel restrictions. “Fully vaccinated” means 14 days have passed since receiving your final dose of the vaccine. 
In order to implement COVID-related guidelines and policies affecting university operations, supervisors may ask employees if they are fully vaccinated. Supervisors may not ask employees why they are not vaccinated or ask any other questions seeking the employee’s personal health information. For example: 
Supervisors should not ask questions such as:
When are you getting vaccinated?
Why haven’t you been vaccinated for COVID-19?
Do you have a health-related reason for not being vaccinated?
If you have been vaccinated, why aren’t you returning to in-person work?

Supervisors may ask questions such as:
Are you willing to disclose whether you have been vaccinated for COVID-19?
Have you been vaccinated for COVID-19?

Supervisors should clarify how vaccination status is relevant to unit operations and ensure that employees who are not vaccinated (or who choose not to disclose their vaccination status) are not penalized or prevented from participating in the operations of the university.
Supervisors cannot require employees to return to in-person work solely because they are vaccinated. Moreover, if an employee has received an accommodation through the Office for Access and Equity (OAE), and the supervisor is not sure whether the accommodation is still necessary, they should contact OAE rather than taking it up with the employee directly. (CAM policy HR-67).
As more members of our campus community and the surrounding region are vaccinated, and as local, state, and federal policy and public health guidance evolves, we will continue to update our guidance for the campus community.
Thank you for your ongoing understanding and patience as we continue to navigate this evolving guidance.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear colleagues:
We are pleased to announce that additional paid days off will again be provided during the December/January holidays, reflecting just how much we appreciate everything you do – especially in this most stressful and challenging of years.
For the sixth straight year, employees who are eligible for leave benefits will receive three paid gift days for this year’s Reduced Service Days on December 29, 30 and 31. Combined with holidays, other paid time off and weekends, it will extend the year-end break from Friday, Dec. 24, through Monday, Jan. 3. Before the program began in 2016, employees had been required to draw from their annual pool of paid time off to be paid for the three Reduced Service Days.
Our universities, hospital and clinics, and system offices will follow up with more details, including how to report the gift days and how they can be used on different days by essential employees who must work on December 29, 30 or 31. For employees in union-represented bargaining units, paid time off for the holidays is addressed through the required collective bargaining process.
The additional paid time off is part of our ongoing efforts to show how much we appreciate your hard work, resiliency, sacrifice and commitment – qualities that have shone brightly throughout the COVID-19 crisis. In the face of extraordinary challenges both on the job and at home, you have come together to not only pull the University of Illinois System through the historic storm but to literally make it a model for the nation.
Thank you for helping write a remarkable new chapter in our more than 150-year legacy of excellence. We hope the coming months bring an end to the pandemic, a return to normal activities on our campuses and in your lives and a traditional, joy-filled holiday season with family and friends.

        Dear students, faculty and staff,
This message is to make you aware of the plan for student fee assessment for Fall 2021. In Fall 2020 and Spring 2021, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, fee assessment was changed each semester in recognition of the reduced in-person services and course offerings.
In anticipation of a semester that will more closely resemble pre-pandemic conditions, Fall 2021 fees will return to standard assessment for students in campus-based programs. Fee assessment for fully online programs has been and remains unchanged.
More information about the Fall 2021 fee schedule can be found on the Office of the Registrar’s website:
Undergraduate
Graduate and Professional
We hope this notice will help students and their families in planning for costs of the upcoming Fall semester.

        Dear UIUC Community, 
 
I want to express how proud I am of everyone for sticking it out through a whole year of online learning. From one student to another I know it’s been especially hard. From having asynchronous classes to being cooped up in your dorm or apartment, this last year has been pretty bleak. In spite of all the challenges; we stayed strong as a community and have overcome these obstacles.  
 
I know that personally, not being able to see all my friends in person and hang out in the Union has put a damper on my college experience. It’s hard to describe how gloomy this past year has been, but that’s why I’m so proud of everyone for persevering. I really cannot express how much I appreciate everyone for their hard work. Thank you for being such an amazing community. It has been a wonderful year representing everyone, in spite of COVID, and I am happy I have had the opportunity to advocate for students.  
 
Remember, our dedication this year means that next year we can return to normality. I can’t wait to see you all next semester, hopefully in person. I, and the entire Illinois Student Government, thank you so much. 
 
Sincerely,

Unit leaders across campus encouraged their colleagues to contribute to any of the almost 700 charities serving causes in our community and around the globe. This was certainly no small feat considering the virtual world in which we live. Thank you for volunteering your time.
We are proud to know our university has helped fund causes benefitting our environment, health, human rights and so much more. This is evidence that even during a global pandemic, we can rise above the challenges of our time and lend a hand to those in need.
I extend my deepest gratitude to all who participated. Plans are underway for the 2021 Campus Charitable Fund Drive, and we look forward to sharing them with you once they are finalized.

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
I am pleased to announce that our university COVID-19 saliva test is now available for family and household members of University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign faculty, staff and students through SHIELD CU, a partnership program with OSF HealthCare. See more information about SHIELD CU here.
SHIELD CU details for university family members
All household and family members of faculty, staff and students who are eight years old or older are eligible.
Family members must download, sign up and use the Safer Community app to be tested and receive results.
Family members must enter the UIN of their university sponsor (faculty, staff or student) when prompted in the Safer Community app. The sponsor must then verify the relationship using their Safer Illinois app. This must be done before testing. Read more about this here.
The cost will be $10 per test administered to a family or household member. The total for all tests administered to all family members will be charged to the university sponsor once per month. Read more about this here.
Family members can only be tested at select lines designated for SHIELD CU at the State Farm Center testing site.
University family members testing will begin on Friday, April 2.
University family members are one of the first groups given the opportunity to use SHIELD CU, an exciting partnership with OSF HealthCare to bring the university-developed SHIELD ecosystem to the local community. SHIELD CU plans to expand testing soon to other community groups, including local schools.
I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity. If you have any questions about testing for family and households, please email SHIELDcu@illinois.edu.

                March 23, 2021 1:01 PM
			
        Dear students, faculty and staff:
The tragic shootings last week in Atlanta and recent escalation of aggression toward Asians and Asian-Americans remind us all of one aspect of our bedrock land-grant mission: to provide a safe, welcoming place for education, opening doors to the opportunities that come with it, for people of every background.
The University of Illinois System reaffirms its commitment to provide this welcoming place for all of our students, faculty and staff, and that explicitly includes our Asian and Asian-American communities and families.
That idea that all are welcome at our three universities is embedded in our Guiding Principles:
“Diversity of backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences enriches campus conversations in and out of the classroom, inspires our creative endeavors, and drives innovative solutions to the world’s problems. Our capacity to listen to and learn from each other is fundamental to our mission of excellence in teaching, research, and learning – and to the cause of the common good.”
Rooted in our commitment to that common good is our belief that we as a state and a nation are stronger because of our diversity, that the many faces, cultures, backgrounds and ideas brought together here are vital to our strength.
We condemn violence and hate in any form, and are committed to diverse campus communities that help prepare students for the increasingly global workplace that awaits when they begin their careers.
We also remind you that resources are always available at all three universities for anyone who needs assistance in difficult times. As one community spread across our three universities and several locales, we encourage you to be respectful of differences, to look out for each other, and to care for yourselves.
Sincerely,

        Dear Graduate Students,
Due to the exceptional circumstances under the pandemic, the Graduate College, with the support of the Chancellor and the Office of the Provost, has approved an emergency modification to the existing Summer Automatic Waiver Policy for 2021. This modification will extend the fee waivers under this policy to include partial coverage of the Health Insurance Fee and full coverage of the Health Service Fee.
The Summer Automatic Waiver Policy provides graduate students who do not have a summer waiver-generating appointment, but who held one in the previous spring, a summer automatic waiver if they register in the summer term.
As a result of the emergency modification for Summer 2021, a summer automatic waiver will provide the same tuition waiver granted during Spring 2021 plus a waiver for the following fees: Service Fee, AFMFA Fee, Library/Technology Fee, 87% of the Health Insurance Fee and full waiver of the Health Service Fee.
This plan underscores our campus commitment to assisting our students to navigate the many challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional information about the program and about summer health coverage is available on the Graduate College website.

        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
As you know, this Wednesday, March 24 is the next non-instruction day in the modified Spring 2021 academic calendar. As a reminder, non-instruction days are to be left entirely free of any mandatory course obligations. This also means work should not be increased immediately before or after these days in a way that does not allow for a break. These days are intended to provide important and necessary rest for our students.
Students, if you have concerns regarding course obligations on these non-instruction days, you are encouraged to contact the head or chair of the department offering the course. Department head/chair names and contact information can be accessed by selecting the course subject in the Spring 2021 Class Schedule and clicking on that subject. The head/chair of department and contact information is listed at the top of the page, above all course numbers and titles offered in that subject. 
Instructors, I encourage you to once again review your course syllabus and schedule to be sure there are no exams, assignments or required class meetings on these non-instruction days. Without a week-long spring break this semester and given the heightened stress associated with the ongoing pandemic, we all appreciate how critical these days are to our students’ wellness. Also, let me take this opportunity to remind you of this guide from the University of Illinois System on supporting students’ wellbeing and promoting a sense of community during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Thank you all for your understanding and patience as we continue to navigate another challenging semester. I am most grateful for your continued compassion for one another and your commitment to the wellbeing of everyone in the community.

        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
I am excited to announce the inaugural call for proposals for the Call to Action Research Program, one of the foundational components of our university-wide Call to Action to Address Racism and Social Injustice. The full request for proposals (RFP) along with the application details can be found here.
We will be holding two online, public information sessions about the program and the proposal submission process. Registration is required.
 Call to Action Research Program Information Sessions and Registration Link
Tuesday, March 30 at noon
Wednesday, March 31 at 4 p.m.
This program begins with a $2 million investment to fund competitively awarded grants that enhance our exceptional cross-disciplinary scholarly strengths and expand community collaborations to build cultures of research that address structures of racism and injustice.
This first call will focus on three critical research areas:
Systemic racism and social justice
Law enforcement and criminal justice reform
Disparities in health and health care
Proposals can be submitted along three different funding tracks, each with a maximum award level.
Community-Based Innovation projects (up to $25,000)
Systemic Institutional Change projects (up to $75,000)
Societal Impact projects (up to $100,000)
Tenure, tenure-track and specialized faculty with appointments in any academic college or research unit in the university are eligible to apply in any of the three tracks. The Community-Based Innovation track is also open to university staff members, members of the community and other non-university organizations, as long as applications are in collaboration with an Illinois faculty or specialized faculty member.
The first step in the competitive process is submission of a brief pre-proposal that describes the proposed project, the objectives and how it connects to the broader Call to Action goals. Pre-proposals are due by April 26, 2021. Projects selected to move to the full proposal stage will be invited to do so with a deadline of June 4, 2021.
The Call to Action to Address Racism and Social Injustice Research Program is an important step forward as we seek to transform the way our own university supports, prioritizes and recognizes the research of scholars working on issues of systemic racism and bias in the United States. 
I hope you will attend one of the information sessions, and I encourage you to look to others across this university and around our entire community to join you in submitting a proposal for this inaugural round of funding.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
The news of Tuesday's shooting of eight people, six of Asian descent, in the Atlanta area is difficult to watch. While we may not yet know the details behind this tragic violence, the anxiety and sense of unease during a period of a sharp rise in anti-Asian and anti-Asian American violence cannot be ignored. According to the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, incidents of anti-Asian hate and bias increased 149% in 2020, while overall hate crimes dropped 7%.
As the Office of Inclusion & Intercultural Relations observed in their statement earlier this month, xenophobia and anti-Asian racism have an entrenched, systemic history in our nation. The resurgence of these anti-Asian patterns of discrimination and hate throughout the past year only intensifies the need for us to stand in clear solidarity against all forms of violence, misogyny and bias. Ensuring equity for every member of our society is essential to the health and well-being of each one of us. Our community must stand together united in support of one another. As a university that researches the roots of racial injustice, health and economic disparities, we must also reject the targeting, blame and scapegoating of racism and xenophobia. Above all, we are committed to providing a safe, open and welcoming environment for all members of our community.
One’s race, ethnicity, identity, religion or national origin should never be used as a threat against anyone’s physical or emotional safety. If you experience an incident of bias or discrimination in our community, please report it to the Bias Assessment and Response Team at bart.illinois.edu. Additionally, the Asian American Cultural Center will be hosting a workshop on how to intervene to stop anti-Asian American harassment and xenophobia. For more information, please visit their webpage at oiir.illinois.edu/aacc.
The success of our university rests firmly on the principle of inviting the best and brightest into our community and supporting each and every person’s capacity to thrive. At Illinois, we bring the world to Urbana-Champaign where the sharing of diverse perspectives, life experiences and ideas transforms lives. To our Asian and Asian American students, faculty, staff and community members, we want you to know that you are not alone. We recognize the collective anxiety, fear and trauma that can result from violent acts, even those committed hundreds or thousands of miles away. We stand with you in solidarity as we continue the work necessary to advance the values of equity and inclusion for all.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

                March 17, 2021 1:58 PM
			
        Dear graduate students,
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign will soon launch a second COVID-19 emergency grant program for graduate students.
The program is funded in large part by the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) II, which is part of the Federal Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSAA), 2021.
These grants are dedicated to helping graduate students who demonstrate exceptional need. Grants can be used toward the cost of education and other emergency costs that have arisen due to the coronavirus, such as tuition, food, housing, health care (including mental health care) or child care. 
Grants for graduate students will be available in amounts between $500 and $1,000.
Degree-seeking students enrolled in any graduate program (including professional programs) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign are eligible to apply, regardless of nationality or citizenship status. Students must be registered during the Spring 2021 semester to qualify.
An application process for graduate students will be announced soon and will be available on The Graduate College website.
Sincerely,
Wojtek Chodzko-ZajkoDean, Graduate College"

                March 16, 2021 10:02 AM
			
        Dear faculty, staff and students,
I’m writing to let you know that the Illini Success team has just released this year’s edition of the Illini Success report, an annual review of the first career destinations of our recent graduates. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, our graduates still found jobs, enrolled in graduate school or began volunteer programs on par with previous years. You can view the full report online here.
Here are a few of the highlights from the new report:
91% of our 2019-2020 graduates secured a job, graduate program or volunteer opportunity within six months of graduation.
75% of in-state graduates who began a job or graduate program said they remained in the state for those opportunities.
$65,178 is the average salary for full-time-employed graduates.
In this year when so many lives and jobs have been disrupted by the pandemic, it is gratifying to see that an Illinois degree provided so many of our recent graduates with a solid foundation for these critical first steps in their careers. While the survey response rate by graduates was a bit lower than our experience in typical years, the report reflects the outcomes of more than half of all graduates for that time period.  
This is fantastic news that illustrates the impact of an Illinois degree. I am incredibly proud of our recent graduates, and I am extremely thankful for our faculty and staff members who ensure that our students succeed.
I hope you will all join me in celebrating the success of our recent graduates.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                March 12, 2021 1:18 PM
			
        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
This fall our university released a Joint Statement on Anti-Semitism, in which we acknowledged and affirmed our belief in the rights of all members of the university community to express their viewpoints, identity and lived experiences, and committing to actions that make that possible. Part of our commitment includes the creation of a group of undergraduate and graduate students, staff, faculty and alumni, as well as representatives from the Jewish community, to help us advance our commitment to an inclusive community where anti-Semitism and all other forms of hate will not be tolerated and each one of us can live and thrive in our full humanity.
Today, I would like to share that I have charged the Chancellor’s Advisory Council on Jewish and Campus Life to assist my office in identifying opportunities to improve and sustain this commitment. The charge of this advisory council includes the following primary responsibilities:
To provide guidance on maintaining an inclusive and welcoming environment for all Jewish students, staff and faculty, and provide concrete recommendations for campus improvements to increase inclusion of all Jewish voices
To assess institutional resources and campus climate for Jewish students, staff and faculty to better understand the current state of individual experiences and institutional support
To support the relationships between the university and the Champaign-Urbana Jewish community, including but not limited to Illini Hillel, Illini Chabad and Sinai Temple
To provide direction on the development of focused and regularly recurring educational and co‑curricular programming, regarding Jewish student inclusion and anti-Semitism
This Advisory Council will be co-chaired by Erez Cohen, Executive Director of Hillel at the University of Illinois, and Richard Herman, former Chancellor of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The inaugural members of the Council include:
Steven Miller, Alumnus, Gies College of Business, 1987                                                            
Lorelei Rosenthal, Community Member, Rosenthal Manufacturing
Rabbi Dovid Tiechtel, Director, Chabad Center for Jewish Life
Lizy Mostowski, PhD Student, Liberal Arts & Sciences, 2023                                    
Tyeese Braslavsky, Student, Liberal Arts & Sciences, 2021                                       
Jared M. London, Student, Grainger College of Engineering, 2023                                      
Dana Rabin, Professor, Interim Chair of Department of History
Eugene Avrutin, Professor, Department of History
Michael Parrish, Assistant Director, Academic and Student Services, Gies College of Business
The full charge letter is available on the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion website.
Acts and expressions of anti-Semitism—in any form—actively undermine the educational process and are in direct opposition to our core values. It is our responsibility to create a university that not only addresses these acts when they occur but also actively supports and celebrates the ability of each student, faculty and staff member to bring their whole selves to the university community.
I’ve asked the Advisory Council to begin work immediately and to provide me with an update by May 31, 2021.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
We are delighted to share that through the overwhelming generosity of our alumni and friends and by virtue of the extraordinary vision of our academic leadership, we have reached our $2.25 billion With Illinois campaign goal!
While we are proud to reach this critically important milestone, our fundraising efforts will not stop. In addition to the respective priorities within each of the colleges and units, we will remain resolute in our commitment to secure private resources from now to the conclusion of the campaign in 2022 toward propelling bright minds, enabling our faculty to find solutions to the world’s challenges and elevating a university of distinction at the heart of Illinois.
We also remind everyone that reaching our goal doesn’t mean these dollars are immediately spendable or that we can use these funds for anything we choose. One-third of the gifts and commitments have been allocated towards our endowment while another one-third are deferred pledges that will be fulfilled over the coming years. The overwhelming majority of these funds have been given for specific purposes such as student scholarships, faculty support and capital projects and can’t be reallocated elsewhere.
The success of this campaign provides ample testimony to the appreciation our alumni have for their Alma Mater and the confidence our friends continue to bestow in the university’s mission. We invite you to celebrate with our entire Illinois family at with.illinois.edu/impact and learn more about the impact of With Illinois.
We are grateful for all your efforts in achieving this important milestone and appreciate your passion toward reaching even greater heights throughout the remainder of the campaign and beyond. Thank you for being With Illinois!

Robert J. JonesChancellor

        Dear Colleagues, 
I write to share revisions to the COVID-19 testing requirements for graduate students that are effective immediately and shared in an email with graduate students earlier today. Graduate students who are not coming to campus are no longer required to test, with the exception of graduate students living in University Housing, including Orchard Downs, Ashton Woods and Goodwin-Green.
All graduate students who are coming to campus for any reason must continue to test in accordance with the COVID-19 testing policy. They must test and receive negative results at least every four days to maintain building access. All students and their adult dependents living in University Housing are required to continue testing and should continue to follow guidelines and notifications from University Housing.
Our COVID-19 testing program under the direction of SHIELD Team has been instrumental in keeping our campus and community safe throughout the pandemic. As the pandemic has changed, so has our response to it. While we are able to ease the testing requirement at this time, if circumstances change we may have to reconsider the testing policy. We believe that regular testing is good for our community and we encourage you to take advantage of it and to follow CDC, IPHD and CUPHD recommendations regarding safe practices during the pandemic. 
The university will continue to provide information for graduate students regarding building access status via the SAFER Illinois app. Graduate students should watch for COVID-related updates in Massmail and in GradLINKS. If you or your students have questions about testing, please visit the campus COVID-19 website or contact the COVID Wellness Team at covidwellness@illinois.edu.

        Dear students, faculty and staff,
As we quickly approach the halfway point of the spring semester, I write to announce our Commencement plans for celebrating Illinois graduates this spring. 2021 Commencement will include both an in-person individual, private Stage Crossing experience and an online celebration featuring a virtual conferral of degrees.
Commencement Stage Crossing Details
2021 and 2020 graduates will be invited to participate in the in-person individual, private Stage Crossing experience. This procession will be specific to each graduate.
Stage Crossings will take place Monday, May 10 – Monday, May 17 at the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts.
Graduates will sign up for a 15-minute time slot on one of these days. During the time slot, the graduate’s name will be announced as they cross a stage.
This celebration will not be college or unit-specific, offering graduates maximum flexibility to choose a timeframe most convenient for them.
Two guests will be allowed to accompany each graduate. Guests will be allowed to photograph their graduate.
Professional photographers will also be present to take formal portraits, and videographers will livestream and record the Stage Crossings.
There will be mandatory COVID-19 safety protocols for all who participate, including wearing face coverings and practicing social distancing. Additional information about these safety protocols will also be shared directly with graduates as they are finalized.
This email is intended as a save-the-date notification. 2021 and 2020 graduates can expect to receive more details about the Stage Crossing and the online celebration via email. Please continue to check the Commencement website for additional information.
All of our decisions related to events continue to be guided by the directives from the Illinois Department of Public Health and advice of our local public health officials. Graduates who cannot or choose not to attend the Stage Crossings are welcome to participate in the online celebration and other virtual experiences for graduates. When it is safe to resume large, in-person gatherings, we still intend to invite graduates from 2020 and 2021 to participate in an on-campus ceremony at Memorial Stadium.
We absolutely understand the importance of Commencement at Illinois, and we are committed to doing everything we can to celebrate the success of Illinois graduates while working to maximize the health and safety of our community. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we work to create experiences that honor our graduating students.
Sincerely,

I write to make you aware that planning for the Fall 2021 semester instruction is well underway. In addition to the success of our ongoing COVID-19 mitigation strategies, we are also encouraged by the success and growing availability of COVID-19 vaccines.
For the Fall semester, we are confident that we will be able to offer considerably more in-person instruction for our students than has been available during the current academic year.
Of course, the university will continue to follow guidance from the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD), the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as it evolves. We anticipate that existing COVID-19 mitigation strategies–face coverings, regular testing, contact tracing–will continue to be in effect during the fall semester.
Departments and colleges are currently developing the Fall 2021 class schedule. We expect the schedule to be available to view on Monday, April 5. Registration for continuing students for the Fall 2021 semester will begin on Monday, April 19.

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
The university has been working closely with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) to monitor local cases of a new COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) variant known as B.1.1.7. We know that this variant has already been detected among members of our university community.
We will continue to identify B.1.1.7 cases as they emerge. According to the CDC, this new variant, which was first detected in the U.K., is more infectious and will likely be the dominant variant of COVID-19 in the U.S. beginning this month.
With our rapid saliva test and frequent testing requirements, we have tools to maximize safety for our entire community, even with the emergence of this new variant. According to CUPHD, because the new variant is even more infectious, it will be vital that we all remain vigilant in our COVID-19 safety practices, including regular testing, practicing social distancing, wearing face coverings, frequent hand washing, etc. It is also more important than ever for individuals who test positive for COVID-19 to isolate immediately.
According to CUPHD, there is already evidence that COVID-19 vaccinations will help protect individuals from B.1.1.7,  but herd immunity with vaccinations will take time, and every effort is required to slow the spread of this and other variants. I strongly encourage you to be vaccinated when you receive a chance to do so. We are grateful to CUPHD for their vaccination leadership, and we will continue to share any vaccination opportunities for our faculty, staff and students.
We will continue to partner with CUPHD to update you on the emergence of B.1.1.7 and any change in guidance as we continue to learn more about this, and other, emerging variants.
Thank you for continuing to do your part to maximize the safety of our entire community.
Sincerely,

                March 1, 2021 1:46 PM
			
        Dear Colleagues,
Recent extreme winter weather events and mass power outages nationally have reinforced the importance of comprehensive energy management strategies that can effectively meet societal demand and protect communities. For campus buildings and infrastructure, that responsibility belongs to Facilities & Services (F&S), which provides safety-focused, reliable, sustainable, and efficient utility service to students, faculty, and staff. Supplying uninterrupted heat, electricity, and chilled water are essential to supporting educational and research activities for the university’s learning, discovery, engagement, and economic development missions.
The F&S Energy Management Plan outlines how a $100M-a-year energy enterprise continues to transform and adapt to the evolving needs of the campus through enhancements in production, distribution, conservation, permitting, and business operations. The plan keeps the university on the path of achieving the milestone of a 50 percent reduction in energy use per square foot by 2026, fourteen years ahead of the Illinois Climate Action Plan (iCAP) target.
Over the next five years, key centralized programs, including retrocommissioning, recommissioning, energy performance contracting, along with supply-side equipment upgrades and net-zero space growth on campus will provide a projected additional energy savings of over 500,000 MMBTUs per year and approximately $13M in cost avoidance.
F&S staff have already made tremendous progress toward many specific iCAP objectives, such as reducing building-level energy, increasing clean power sources like solar and geothermal, and improving green building design and space utilization. These efforts greatly support the university’s climate leadership commitments to achieving carbon neutrality as soon as possible and strengthening resilience to climate change.
In all aspects of our operations, F&S is dedicated to advancing innovation and making service delivery improvements as a part of the Operational Excellence initiative in the university's Strategic Plan “The Next 150.” By creating partnerships and expanding outreach programs with the campus community, the organization will continue implementing integrated energy solutions and best practices that return better value and offer superior customer service.
Providing dependable and cost-effective utilities production and distribution is critical to securing the campus’ energy future, displaying dedicated environmental leadership, and further promoting world-class academic collaboration. Thanks to ongoing teamwork and detailed planning, we have made significant advancements over the last two decades and are well positioned for much success in the years ahead.

                February 24, 2021 10:02 AM
			
        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
To accelerate our efforts to recruit faculty of color to campus, the University is investing additional funds to support as many as 15 new Targets of Opportunity Program (TOP)-eligible hires through the 2022-2023 academic year.
This expansion of the TOP program is part of our institutional commitment to increasing faculty diversity as highlighted in The Next 150 Strategic Plan. These additional funds for faculty hires will enhance the comprehensive impact of the Call to Action to Address Racism and Social Injustice initiative being led by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. 
To distribute these funds, the campus will employ a modified faculty search waiver process, based on the procedures outlined in the Targets of Opportunity Program found here. The modified process includes two different opportunities this year for academic units to apply for faculty search waivers.
Colleges may submit proposals for “stand alone” or individual unit hires by March 22, 2021. We anticipate between eight and ten search waivers will be approved by this method.
Colleges may choose to submit proposals for a multi-unit, themed cluster strategy that connect with one of the campus priorities identified in the strategic plan. Proposals around a theme must include the participation of at least two different academic units. Cross-college partnerships and participation of our University’s research institutes and centers in the development of the proposals are strongly encouraged. We anticipate approval of between six and nine waivers by this method. Applications for themed cluster hires are due by May 1, 2021.
Full details, eligibility information and application instructions are outlined in Provost Communication #7: Targets of Opportunity Program (TOP). 
Please note that the process for the “TOP Traditional Search” remains unchanged. TOP candidates identified through existing approved searches remain eligible for campus support as outlined in Provost Communication #7. All units are encouraged and expected to develop the most diverse pool of candidates for their searches, and to leverage all opportunities to accelerate and increase their success in recruiting faculty of color.
This investment in the TOP program offers our academic units an additional tool in their efforts to recruit and retain faculty of color and further the diversity of excellence here at Illinois.

Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs & Provost"

                February 23, 2021 3:01 PM
			
        Dear faculty and staff,
After careful evaluation and research, we are pleased to share that we will adopt Canvas as the campus-supported Learning Management System (LMS) with full migration completed in June 2022. Click here to learn more.
Why We're Moving
For several years, our primary campus LMS has been Illinois Compass, a Blackboard product. Our current instance of Blackboard will retire in June 2022. We are using this opportunity to transition toward a common, modern LMS ecosystem to reduce frustrations, streamline support, and maximize future resources. Canvas has been identified as state-of-the-art in LMS platforms and is used by 11 of 14 institutions in the Big 10 Academic Alliance.
Importantly, we believe that adopting Canvas will aid in student success. One of the findings of multiple Student Success Initiative working groups was that the proliferation of LMS and LMS-like systems across campus was difficult for students to navigate. We are hopeful that a transition to Canvas will provide a strong foundational tool that we can build upon to aid in student success.
The selection of Canvas is the culmination of a review process that included a multi-semester, cross-campus pilot program as well as surveys and feedback from instructors and students.
We recognize that COVID-19 and activity related to online instruction makes the timing of this transition a challenge. In addition to providing training for instructors to utilize this new tool, we are actively working to automate many steps of the transition to ensure that we minimize time and effort while helping instructors take advantage of the benefits very quickly.
Transition Timeline
We are actively preparing for the transition now. Technology Services and the Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning (CITL) are in consultation with college educational technology experts.  We are establishing a Canvas Advisory Committee as well as a number of working groups in order to ensure a smooth transition. We are also in close contact with peer institutions who have recently made this transition, and their “lessons learned” have been extremely valuable in formulating our strategy.
The timeline for the transition is as follows:
Spring 2021 – Working groups, planning, preparation.
Summer 2021 – First group of courses migrate. Faculty training, workshops, and course migration support in full swing.
Fall 2021 – First group of courses utilizing Canvas. Second group of courses migrate.
Spring 2022 – Majority of courses migrated and utilizing Canvas.
Summer 2022 – Final set of courses migrate.
June 2022 – Migration to Canvas complete.
Stay Tuned
A formally structured and coordinated approach to implementing Canvas will ensure a smooth transition from Compass and other LMS platforms. In March, we will provide more details about training and timelines. Please review the Canvas Transition website for additional background and the most up-to-date information. We value your feedback. For any questions, concerns and suggestions, please contact us .
We look forward to sharing this next generation learning resource with the university community.
Sincerely,
Kevin PittsVice Provost for Undergraduate Education"

                February 22, 2021 9:01 AM
			
        Dear Members of the Campus Community,
I am delighted to share with you today that the Carle Illinois College of Medicine has been granted provisional accreditation by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) following an in-depth review of educational and program quality standards. Provisional accreditation moves the college’s novel engineering-based M.D. degree program one step closer to full accreditation in 2022. 
This provisional accreditation is a critically important step in the multistage process in which we must demonstrate that the College complies with LCME standards for educational quality, and provisional accreditation affirms that the Carle Illinois College of Medicine meets nationally accepted standards of educational quality. 
Carle Illinois gained preliminary accreditation from LCME in 2017 and welcomed 32 students for its first class in July 2018.
The full accreditation survey visit likely will happen when the inaugural class – the Carle Illinois class of 2022 – is in its final year, but the process may be delayed due to COVID-19.
Carle Illinois College of Medicine was created in 2015 as the world’s first medical college to incorporate engineering and technology principles into medical education, and it is the first new college created at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in more than 60 years.
This provisional accreditation is a great accomplishment and another historic milestone for a groundbreaking new kind of medical school. The post-COVID-19 world is going to need innovations in health care and medicine more than ever, and this is an important step in positioning Carle Illinois to lead the way.
Congratulations to Dean King Li and his team on this important achievement.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Colleagues,
It is with great sadness that we must tell you that Greg Gulick, Interim Chief Information Officer, passed away yesterday afternoon from COVID-19.
As Interim CIO, Greg led Technology Services in supporting, growing and improving the massive IT infrastructure that is a foundation for virtually every aspect of our university operations and missions. He joined the university in 2003 and spent most of his Illinois career in the department he came to lead.
We have both had the privilege of working closely with Greg for a number of years in our respective roles. We do not have enough words or space here to adequately describe his integrity, his expertise and skill and his dedication to our students, staff and faculty and the broader community. But to those of us who worked with him in any capacity, it was the quiet and constant kindness he showed to every person in every circumstance on every occasion that earned him such enormous respect and trust. And those qualities were needed more than ever in this year at Illinois.
Greg’s empowering and compassionate leadership during this COVID-19 year is a major reason why our university was able to reopen this fall and bring our students back to campus. As an integral member of our university COVID-19 Steering Committee and part of our SHIELD team, Greg was instrumental in guiding our decisions and actions in directions that always put the well-being and needs of our students, staff and faculty first. The extensive and complex technological infrastructure necessary to support our academic and research missions, to sustain remote work, to tackle and overcome challenges in remote teaching and learning and to sustain our testing ecosystem that was developed and implemented by his colleagues in Technology Services in close collaborations of all campus units has been nothing short of transformational this year.
It is a simple and honest fact that Greg’s tireless efforts throughout this devastating pandemic have helped protect every single one of us living, studying and working here on the campus and in our local community. We owe him our gratitude.
We have lost a university leader, a compassionate colleague and a friend.
We ask that you keep Greg’s family in your hearts and minds today.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

                February 16, 2021 2:47 PM

        Dear Colleagues,
Due to an extended stretch of severe winter weather and extremely high electric demand across the Midwest, Facilities & Services (F&S) is designating today through Monday, February 22, as an Energy Alert period for the Urbana campus. F&S requests that everyone conserve energy on campus to the greatest extent possible. If practical, shut off, shut down, sleep mode, or unplug the following:
Lights
Computers
Monitors
Printers
Chargers
Appliances
Other nonessential equipment
Close the following items to protect facility equipment and systems:    
Outside windows and doors in conditioned areas
Fume hood sashes when not in use
Continuous freezing temperatures throughout the week will substantially increase demand on the regional electric grid and require significant energy load optimization strategies from F&S’ Utilities & Energy Services division. Abbott Power Plant will continue to provide uninterrupted energy services to campus that are essential for research and teaching activities.
Why is energy conservation important to the university?
Conserving energy is everyone’s responsibility and supports the Illinois Climate Action Plan (iCAP) sustainability goals for energy efficiency. The combined efforts of individuals, departments, colleges, institutes, and schools are needed to increase energy awareness and further promote Operational Excellence in the university's Strategic Plan ""The Next 150.""
How does reducing energy use help steward resources?
Reducing the university’s energy consumption, especially during this time of peak demand, is critical to effectively managing resources. Abbott generates approximately half of the campus’ electricity through an efficient cogeneration process, simultaneously producing steam for heating and electricity. The remainder of the power is purchased from the regional grid. 
Thanks for your commitment to conserving energy across the Urbana campus. For temperature-related issues regarding specific rooms and building spaces, immediately contact the F&S Energy Management Control Center at fandsenergycomm@illinois.edu, 217-244-3783.

As a reminder, the following priority parking lots will be cleared first and regularly maintained during the event. Individuals are encouraged to use these lots along with MTD service until smaller lots are cleared: 
Lot B4, Levels Four and Five (North Campus) – Parking facility at the corner of University Avenue and Mathews Avenue
Shuttle Lot E14 (South Campus) –  West of the State Farm Center, south end only
Lot F27 (South Campus) – Adjacent to the Veterinary Medicine Basic Sciences Building
Vehicles parked in priority lots B4, E14, and F27 with a valid virtual permit for other rental facilities will not be cited for violations.

                February 11, 2021 8:02 AM
			
        Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,
I write to alert you about an incident of targeted vandalism that happened at a student apartment near campus earlier this week when someone threw raw eggs at a balcony where an Israeli flag was displayed. The University of Illinois Police Department is investigating the incident and will take appropriate action if those responsible are identified.
As a campus community, we cannot allow disrespectful and hostile acts such as this to happen without comment and condemnation. Anonymous, targeted vandalism of expressions of personal and national identity create a climate of fear and distrust, threatening a sense of inclusion and safety that is foundational to our campus community. It is our responsibility to speak together to say loudly and clearly that this behavior is antithetical to the values of our university, and that anti-Semitism in any form will not be tolerated.
We must not only respond to incidents such as this with condemnation, but also actively create a campus community where these incidents do not occur, and I want to be as transparent as I can about incidents of intolerance and hate when they happen and our response to them. To do the work needed to live our community values, we are committed to the actions outlined in the Joint Statement on Anti-Semitism released in November, including the creation of an Advisory Council on Jewish and Campus Life. We are now moving swiftly to organize and confirm the full membership of the council, and we will announce the members in the near future.
We are also conducting listening sessions that began during the fall semester, as part of ongoing efforts to be supportive and responsive to the needs of Jewish students, faculty and staff. We invite all members of our community to bring their whole selves to Illinois. For this to be realized, we must ensure that each person is not deprived of the chance to live and learn in an atmosphere free of fear and intimidation. All members of the university community have the right to express their viewpoints, identity and lived experiences, and we stand united against all forms of anti-Semitism.
We are still gathering information about this recent incident, and we will share additional information about the Advisory Council soon. If you experience an incident of bias or discrimination in our community, please report it to the Bias Assessment and Response Team.
Sincerely,
Sean C. GarrickVice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion"

        Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,
Last week the university experienced two phishing campaigns that targeted students. We would like to remind everyone to be vigilant and careful with email. Cybercriminals are constantly seeking to compromise your account, steal your data, steal your money, or worse, steal your identity.
If an email asks for personal information (full name, mailing address, phone number, etc.), do not provide it. If an email describes an offer that seems too good to be true, it probably is. If an email from an unknown sender contains a link, an attachment or misspellings, use extra caution.
Simply put, if it looks strange or out of the ordinary, delete it. Report it to the Help Desk at consult@illinois.edu or report it to an IT Professional.
Technology Services has an informational web page where you can learn more about protecting yourself from phishing and related scams. You can find it at https://techservices.illinois.edu/security/phishing

                February 10, 2021 2:25 PM
			
        Dear university community,
In response to stress and anxiety associated with the ongoing COVID-19 environment, and with approval by the Academic Senate, we are implementing the following academic policy modifications effective immediately for the Spring 2021 semester.
Drop Deadlines
The deadlines to drop a course without a grade of W and, for undergraduates, to use the campus Grade Replacement Policy, has been extended to the last day of instruction as follows:
1st 8-week (POTA) courses – Friday, March 19, 2021 at 11:59 p.m. Central Time.
2nd 8-week (POTB) courses – Wednesday, May 5, 2021 at 11:59 p.m. Central Time.
Full-semester (POT1) courses – Wednesday, May 5, 2021 at 11:59 p.m. Central Time.
Nonstandard courses – Last date of instruction, 11:59 p.m. Central Time.

Most course drops can be performed through Self-Service until 11:59 p.m. CST on the last day of instruction unless the drop puts the student below full-time enrollment status.
Extension of the drop deadline does not change the refund schedule.
Students who drop a course via Self-Service or who withdraw completely from the university on or before the drop deadline will not receive W (withdrawal) grades. Students who successfully petition their college for a drop of a course or who withdraw from the semester after the drop deadline will receive W grades.
Pass COVID/No Pass COVID
Pass COVID/No Pass COVID (PZ/NZ) grade mode options will be available, replacing the Credit/No Credit grade mode for the Spring 2021 semester.
Pass COVID (PZ) will apply to grades of D- or higher, will earn course credit and can be used to fulfill major, minor and general education requirements.
No Pass COVID (NZ) equates to a failing grade and does not earn course credit.
Pass COVID/No Pass COVID grades do not factor into a student’s GPA.
Undergraduates will be able to select Pass COVID/No Pass COVID after final grades are available in Self-Service. The selection period, May 22-27, gives a 6-day window for students to decide if they want to exchange their letter grade for the PZ/NZ grade mode.
Graduate students will work with the Graduate College to submit requests for use of the PZ/NZ grade mode.
The deadline for undergraduate and graduate students to elect or rescind PZ/NZ grading is Thursday, May 27, 2021 at 11:59 p.m. Central Time.
PZ/NZ grading is not available to students in College of Law programs or students enrolled in the MD or DVM programs.
Grades of F that are the result of an academic integrity violation sanction are not eligible for this option.
In making decisions about dropping courses or these options, consultation with academic advisors, college offices and the Office of Student Financial Aid for students receiving aid is strongly encouraged. As is always the case, students facing exceptionally difficult or unexpected circumstances that may require other accommodations continue to have the option to seek assistance through their college office.
A more detailed FAQ will be available on the Office of the Provost’s policies website within the next few days. We thank the Academic Senate for their important and timely role in implementing these policy modifications.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

        Dear Students,
As you know, in the past several weeks, the university has successfully completed our re-entry testing program for the Spring 2021 semester. We are going to lift the essential activities only guidance beginning today. Thank you for doing your part to maximize the safety of our entire community.
However, I encourage you to still use extreme caution when interacting in your daily lives. We know that the highly contagious B117 COVID-19 variant has already been confirmed at our university. And we have already seen a small spike that resulted from people violating safety protocols. Throughout this semester, it is absolutely critical that we continue to work together.
I know this essential activities only guidance has been difficult. And it is my intention that allowing you more freedom to leave your residence and interact safely will be welcome news. I know you came to this great and diverse university to connect with others and have rich experiences. I want to provide as much of that as possible – within boundaries designed to maximize your health and safety. In this spirit, the university is planning events and activities for you to safely interact. We will also provide guidance on planning your own safe social interactions. You can expect to hear more details in the coming days.
Please do not take this as an invitation to break COVID-19 safety guidance and have parties. We know that if this happens, our positivity rates will spike, and those who participate could suffer health risks, face university discipline, and the university will be forced to enact another essential activities only period. I do not want this. You do not want this. Please help me in encouraging your friends and peers to continue to be vigilant.
As your chancellor, I sincerely hope and believe the end of this pandemic is nearer. More vaccines are being administered each day in our state and in our community. We continue to have the absolute best public health district in the state. Please help me in being diligent until this pandemic is just a memory for us all. I am counting on you all to help me and to help one another.

        Dear Colleagues,
As we finalize our review applications for admission for the Fall 2021 semester, in cooperation with the Senate Committee on Admissions, we would like to remind you of the university policies regarding admissions confidentiality and third-party inquiries. Admissions officers may discuss a student’s application only with the applicant, the applicant’s parents/legal guardian, spouse or school-appointed counselor. Other individuals, including university employees without admissions responsibilities, are not permitted to inquire about a student’s application with a university admissions officer, and admissions officers are prohibited from sharing information with third parties regarding a student’s application.
A university admissions officer is considered anyone with admissions responsibility. This includes not only admissions staff in central admissions units such as the Office of Undergraduate Admissions and the Graduate College, but also faculty and staff within academic college and departmental offices responsible for reviewing and making decision recommendations for applicants. A firewall has been placed around faculty, administrators and admissions staff with admissions responsibility so that those without admissions responsibility may not influence decisions. Unsolicited letters of recommendation, support or appeal are not accepted or considered in our processes. Please review this Summary of University of Illinois Admissions Firewall Practices for a complete list of inquiries that are and are not permitted, as well as examples of scenarios and appropriate responses.
At the graduate level, it is important to note that those with admissions responsibility are allowed to accept information from an applicant’s recommenders in the form of formal letters, emails and phone communications; however, they may not discuss the applicant’s admission status with the recommender. If they are contacted about an applicant’s admission status by a recommender, they are to notify the recommender that while they may accept supporting information for the applicant’s file, they may not discuss the applicant’s admission status without expressed written permission from the applicant. Also at the graduate level, the Graduate College discourages any discussions with an applicant’s parent and/or spouse regarding the applicant’s status without the written permission from the applicant.
Inappropriate activities or attempts to circumvent these policies should be reported to the Ethics Officer or reported anonymously using the anonymous report feature of the Admissions Inquiry Log.
Thank you for helping to protect the integrity of our admissions process.

        Colleagues,Technology Services Privacy and Security has developed a new online, self-paced security awareness training program. The goals are encouraging learning and better protecting you and the University from cyber threat.
Beginning in July 2021 all faculty, staff, and researchers will be required to complete annual security, privacy and data awareness training. The University is requiring such training because:
We wish to help the campus community stay current and aware so that individuals do not become victims, inadvertently mishandle data, or go astray of policies or laws.
Not having such a training program impacts potential access to both federal and private sector grants. There are increasing requirements and industry standards from external partners to confirm that the University requires annual awareness training. 
Throughout the spring semester, we will do a soft launch of the program and training will be optional. I encourage everyone to take one or more of the trainings over the next few months. The information presented benefits individuals inside and outside of work. We welcome all feedback related to improving the experience. Provide feedback to securitytraining@uillinois.edu.Sincerely,Joe BarnesChief Privacy & Security Officer"

        Dear Students and Employees,
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act requires the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:
http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/
The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.
Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to marijuana in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s marijuana prohibition.
The university’s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.
The university’s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.
Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. University employees should contact Illinois Human Resources at (217) 333-2137.

        Dear students, faculty and staff:
It is a pleasure for me to join your chancellors in welcoming you back for the spring semester, and I hope you are as filled with hope as I am about what the coming months promise.
Every one of you has so much to be proud of for getting us here – to a point where it finally seems possible to begin putting the pandemic in the rear view and moving back toward the lives we now cherish more than ever. You have sacrificed and adapted – teaching and learning in hybrid ways, working remotely, and adopting new behaviors such as saliva testing, wearing masks and social distancing. You have come together to safeguard our universities and surrounding communities, making the University of Illinois System a model for the nation.
As vaccinations roll out to curb the virus, we can be grateful to our scientists and healthcare professionals who helped develop these innovative medicines. Yet I believe more work lies ahead, beyond conquering the deadliest pandemic in a century. Momentum must continue to bridge our nation’s lingering racial divide, as well as the economic gap between the haves and have nots. We must also work together to mend our divisions, to preserve debate while reducing hate and rancor, and to find solutions that protect our environment and our standing as a welcoming nation that America has carried since its birth.
Across all of those fronts, the U of I System will again lead the way, just as we have throughout the COVID-19 crisis. We have already set the pace through our Guiding Principles, first adopted in 2018 and expanded a year later. They stake our position on several crucial issues, from free speech and civic engagement to sustainability and immigration, reflecting the core values that define us and the ideals that we hold most dear. Please take another look at our Guiding Principles.
I hope you are as proud as I am to be part of an institution that is truly ahead of the game, an institution with its bearings in place, an institution committed to excellence and integrity in everything we do, an institution that is focused squarely on education and discovery that lifts the lives of all of our students and directly supports the public good.
I wish you all the very best in the semester to come, and my deepest thanks again for your hard work and cooperation during one of the most challenging periods in our more than 150-year history. And please keep up your COVID protocols as the finish line draws nearer. We have achieved far too much together to let our guard down now.
Sincerely,Tim"

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
Welcome back to this first week of the spring semester. This comes after the delayed return we implemented to allow our students time to complete two negative tests before beginning class. As you also know, concerns about a new spike in infections, especially with the arrival of more contagious COVID-19 variants led to my request that members of the campus community limit themselves to essential activities. 
I know this is a difficult request for all of us. But I write to implore all of our students, staff and faculty to adhere to this request. I also want to reiterate that all of our COVID-19 policies and operational rules are still being actively enforced. We will continue to exercise disciplinary action against those who do not comply with our COVID-19 requirements – including testing, social distancing and limitations on gathering sizes. And as we announced last week, students who are out of compliance may also lose access to university Wi-Fi, Zoom, Compass and other technologies. 
We will take enforcement seriously. But the honest truth is that the safety and health of this community depends on the decisions each of us makes on a daily basis. When we choose to wear masks, even when we’re not in a campus facility. When we follow our required weekly COVID testing schedule. When we decide to stay home rather than attend a party or stand in a crowded line – even though we just want to pretend the world is “normal” again, even if it’s just for an hour or two.
These decisions are hard. They are wearing us all down. And like many of you reading this, I too find myself besieged and beset by COVID-fatigue. But these good decisions and these difficult choices really can lead to truly life-changing outcomes.
Last week, I joined other community leaders in dedicating a memorial to those in Champaign County who have died from COVID-19. The “Open Hearts” memorial is easily seen from Green Street on the grounds of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Champaign-Urbana. On the day of event, it consisted of a field of more than 100 markers that each represented a life lost. In just a single week, at least three more markers must be added to this sad testament of the losses just in our own local community.
COVID-19 is not merely a nuisance or an inconvenience. These dashboards with those numbers to which we have grown so hardened are not statistics to be debated and analyzed.
These are human lives. Every infection. Every hospitalization. Every death.
Each of those markers along Green Street represents a parent, a grandparent, a sibling, a child, a friend, a neighbor, a former teacher, a coworker – someone who is being mourned. For those of us, including myself, who have lost family members in the pandemic, we see the faces and hear the voices of those we knew and loved in those markers. This is a singular sadness I would spare anyone if it was in my power.   
For nearly a year, this entire community has come together in virtually every conceivable way to fight this pandemic and to do all we can to look out for one another. 
I ask that you please, please continue to do so now as we enter this very dangerous period of the pandemic.
Vaccinations are a welcome light at the end of a tunnel. But that tunnel is still very long and dark. Until we reach its end, masks, social distancing and constant vigilance are going to be needed. It is up to all of us to do whatever is necessary so that we do not have to add more markers to that memorial that is located right in the heart of this university all of us have worked so hard to preserve in this enormously hard year.
Thank you for your commitment to one another and for your willingness to hold on for just a little while longer.
We have come this far together. Please do not let up now when we finally have an end in sight.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                January 22, 2021 3:22 PM
			
        Dear Campus Community Members, 
Last week you received a message about changes to the Zoom login process for Spring 2021. As of Tuesday, January 19, 2021, all University of Illinois users should log in to their University of Illinois Zoom account using your university NetID and password through Single Sign-On (SSO) to access University of Illinois Zoom meetings and event. All non-University of Illinois users will need to be signed into Zoom through a free Zoom account to access a University of Illinois Zoom event.   
What changed on January 19? To reduce the possibility of Zoombombings the Only Authenticated Users Can Join function in Zoom will be turned on by default for all meetings and webinars created after 7 am on Tuesday, January 19.  Turning this setting on will ONLY prevent anonymous access to meetings. The setting will not limit attendees to Illinois users. Anyone with a Zoom account (either a free account or an account through another university) will be permitted to connect after they sign in to Zoom.  
Specific details about how to sign in to Zoom are included in the original message to the campus community and you can find step-by-step instructions on the page Zoom, Logging In. 
How can speakers and guests from outside of the university join an Illinois Zoom event? Non-University of Illinois users, including invited speakers and members of the general public, will need to sign in to Zoom using their free Zoom account. Members of the general public can sign up for an account at https://zoom.us/signup. If a non-University of Illinois participant clicks on a Zoom meeting link without the client installed, the participant will be prompted to install the Zoom client. They can then install it or choose “cancel” and they can join the meeting with a web browser. 
We recommend that you include instructions about university Zoom meeting and webinar requirements in your event information to outside participants and provide directions suggesting that they sign up for a free Zoom account before the event. 
What happens if an attendee does not sign in to Zoom?For meetings and webinars created after 7 am on January 19th, if an attendee tries to join before signing in to Zoom, they may receive a message: “This Meeting is for Authorized Users Only.” To correct this problem, external participants should log in via their institutional or personal Zoom accounts. University of Illinois users should check that they have signed in through SSO, follow the steps on the page Zoom: Safe, Inclusive and Accessible Space for ALL, then open the meeting again. 
Please note: When creating the Zoom meeting or webinar, event planners will have the option to turn off the Only Authenticated Users Can Join setting manually. In certain circumstances, including events with robust pre-registration processes and Zoom Webinar events, turning this function off may make managing the event easier. However, turning this setting off may open the event up to the potential of Zoombombing and other unwanted disruptions and is not recommended. 
Are there additional ways that I can protect my event from Zoombombing?  To create events that are both easy to manage and reduce the risk of Zoombombing, we recommend the use of the registration function with manual approvals for attendees in Zoom. For detailed instructions on how to set up your event, please see Zoom, Planning your event.  
We strongly discourage the sharing of Zoom meeting IDs and passwords on flyers, social media, public calendars, and websites. Publicly sharing meeting ids and passwords is an open invitation to intrusions.  
What should I do if I have more questions or concerns?If you have problems signing in to Zoom, please contact Technology Services Help Desk at consult@illinois.edu or call (217) 244-7000. 
If a Zoombombing does occur during a class or event that you host, please report the incident to the Office for Access & Equity or the Bias Assessment and Response Team. Zoombombing attacks violate the values of the University of Illinois, and no member of our community or event attendee should experience the disrespectful intrusions and harms that these attacks can cause. 
Thank you for your help in creating a safe and inclusive learning environment for all members of the University of Illinois community. These steps will help you to create a safe virtual meeting environment for your students and event participants.

        Dear faculty and staff,
I am writing to make sure you are aware of some important news from the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD). They announced today that COVID-19 vaccines are now available for Champaign County residents who are 65 years of age and older.
Full details can be found in this CUPHD press release, but we have outlined the high-level details below. Champaign County residents with questions about vaccines should contact CUPHD by phone (217-239-7877) or email (coronavirus@c-uphd.org).
Eligibility
You must live in Champaign County.
You must be 65 years of age or older.
Appointments
Vaccinations will be done by appointment only.
Appointments will take place next week.
Appointments are available at either location below, regardless of where you receive care.  
Vaccination Locations
1901 N. Market Street, Champaign(Previously the Dress Barn location in the Kohl’s Plaza)
To schedule an appointment, call (217) 902-6100.
1900 S. 1st Street, Champaign(East wing of the I Hotel and Conference Center)
The quickest way to schedule is online at https://www.signupgenius.com/go/60b054ca8a82ca5f94-additional.
Scheduling is also available by calling (217) 239-7877.
At this time, the university does not control who receives the vaccine in what order or the timelines. CUPHD does not anticipate the vaccine being widely available until later this spring, so if you are not in the group scheduled for vaccination in this round, please be patient. We do not yet know which groups will be offered the vaccine next or when.
Currently, vaccines are being distributed by the county where the person resides, and CUPHD is leading distribution for our county. University employees who live in other counties should seek information from the county in which they live.
As we learn more information about next steps, we will update the campus community as soon as we are able. Please continue to check the university’s COVID-19 vaccination page for the most updated information.
The distribution of a vaccine is welcome news, but we must continue to be as diligent as ever in safety precautions, including regular COVID-19 testing, wearing face coverings, social distancing, hand washing and avoiding large gatherings. Thank you in advance for your understanding as we work through this next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and rely on our public health leaders to make the best decisions for our community.

                January 20, 2021 1:17 PM
			
        Dear students,
As many of you return to campus to prepare for the Spring 2021 semester, I want to share some important safety information. Our Shield team predicts an increase in COVID-19 cases as we repopulate the campus. We also expect to see the highly contagious B117 variant enter our community. This variant of the virus appears to spread 50 percent faster than any other strains. It has already caused the UK to go into lockdown and has already been detected in our state. In the next several weeks it is absolutely critical that we work together to maximize the safety of our entire community.
After a spike of positive cases early in the Fall 2020 semester, we all worked together to flatten the curve and prevent any more spikes the rest of the semester. We were also encouraged that there was no evidence of COVID-19 spread in the classroom and no evidence of COVID-19 spread from the campus to the larger community. We want these facts to be true again this semester, but we need your help.   
And I need to be very clear that students who do not follow all COVID-related expectations face university disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. Please note that this semester, students who are out of compliance may also lose access to university Wi-Fi, Zoom, Compass and other technologies. 
Participate in Essential Activities Only Until Feb. 8 For the first several weeks, students should limit their in-person interactions to only the most essential activities: taking COVID-19 tests, attending class, purchasing groceries and food, going to work, engaging in individual outdoor activity, attending religious services and seeking medical attention. This also means that once you arrive on campus for the semester, you should avoid travel outside the Champaign-Urbana area. The target date for lifting essential activities only is Monday, Feb. 8 but it could be sooner or later depending on what the data show about virus spread. I will communicate any updates.
Participate in Return TestingAll students must receive two negative on-campus test results, no closer than three days apart, between Jan. 15-24. Students should get their first on-campus COVID-19 test as soon as possible when they return to campus and remain in the local community. Students will have “Access Denied” status in the Safer Illinois app and Boarding Pass until they receive their second negative test result. After receiving two negative test results, students should continue their twice-per-week on-campus COVID-19 testing schedules. See more information here.
Continue other COVID-19 Safety MeasuresWe will continue to require everyone to practice social distancing on campus and to wear face coverings in university facilities unless alone in a private space. Face coverings are also required for outdoor campus spaces where sufficient social distancing is not possible. Students are also required to comply with quarantine and isolation guidelines from the university and Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. All students who did not finish the COVID-19 online training previously for the Fall 2020 semester are required to complete it before the start of the Spring 2021 semester which begins Monday, Jan. 25.
I know the fall semester was not easy, and we all have COVID-19 fatigue. But I want you to know I am extremely proud of each of you and of the COVID-19 ecosystem we have been able to build together at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign to contain virus spread and continue delivering on our missions.
It's so important that we all continue to follow these procotols, while we work with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) to offer vaccines to students, faculty and staff in our community. We will share more updates on vaccines with you throughout the semester because we know getting our community vaccinated is a critical step in ending this pandemic. 
I am happy to report that we are actively planning new ways to support your wellness and mental health during this time. And we are also working on ways to provide students with more interaction and engagement. We want you to have more freedom and an even better university experience this semester. To do those things, it is essential that we make it through these first few weeks of the semester by being relentless in protecting ourselves and each other.
Thank you for your understanding, patience and persistence. I am so proud to be your chancellor.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        All Undergraduate and Graduate Students: ­­­­
All students living on-campus or residing in Champaign, Urbana, or Savoy are required to test even if they are taking a fully online schedule. In addition, the university’s COVID-19 testing policy requires all students working on-campus, attending in-person classes, or participating in any on-campus activities to participate in the on-campus testing program.
The university has developed a process for students who are living locally (Urbana, Champaign, and Savoy) and who are not coming to campus during the spring 2021 semester to apply for an exemption from the COVID-19 testing requirement. Exemptions will be granted rarely and only to students who can demonstrate that participating in the testing program is especially burdensome to them.
Effective Friday, January 15, students who wish to apply for an exemption should submit their information at go.illinois.edu/CovidExemption.
Only students who are living locally and NOT coming to campus are eligible to request an exemption.
Students who were granted an exemption from testing in the fall 2020 semester will need to reapply for a spring 2021 exemption at go.illinois.edu/CovidExemption.

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,  
Throughout the transition to virtual meeting platforms, the University of Illinois has worked to reduce Zoombombings by intruders whose sole purpose has been to disrupt an online meeting with often racist, threatening, or violent images and views. However, at universities across the country including Illinois, Zoombombings continue to occur. 
To create safe, inclusive, and accessible online spaces for teaching and learning and further secure Zoom meetings, as of Tuesday, January 19, 2021, all University of Illinois users will be required to log in to their University of Illinois Zoom account using their university NetID and password to access University of Illinois Zoom meetings and events.  
We strongly recommend that you log in early to your first Zoom class or meeting on or after January 19 to ensure that you are properly signed in to your University of Illinois Zoom account.  
After opening the Zoom desktop or mobile application, follow the steps below: 
Click “Sign In” 
Then, click “Sign In with SSO” 
Type “Illinois” and click “Continue” 
Log in with your university NetID and password, and respond to the 2FA prompt. 
All University of Illinois users should click the Sign in with SSO (Single Sign-On) button first in order to log on to your University of Illinois Zoom account. Single Sign-On is the gateway to University of Illinois resources using your NetID and university password. Please review this article for step-by-step instructions: Zoom, Logging In. 
If you try to join a meeting before you have signed in with SSO, you may receive a message that says: “This Meeting is for Authorized Users Only.” To correct this problem, check that you have signed in through Single-Sign On, follow the steps on the page Zoom: Safe, Inclusive and Accessible Space for ALL, then open the meeting again. 
If you continue to have problems, please contact Technology Services Help Desk at consult@illinois.edu or call (217) 244-7000.  
Zoombombing attacks violate the mission and values of the University of Illinois, and no member of our community should need to experience the disrespectful intrusion and harm that these attacks can cause. If a Zoombombing does occur in a virtual class or meeting, please report the incident to the Office for Access & Equity or the Bias Assessment and Response Team. This change to a more secure login process for the University of Illinois community will allow us to continue to create the safe experience that our community deserves and expects while we teach, learn and work in virtual spaces during the Spring semester.

        Dear Members of the Campus Community,
The annual celebration of the life and legacy of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. every January is a reminder of the fervent belief in a dream that who we can and should be as a nation depends upon recognizing the full humanity of each person, a dream rooted in honest examination of history and the work for racial justice when inequity exists.
It is our community’s commitment to the dream of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. that we will celebrate this month with a series of events, beginning with the MLK Advocacy for Justice Virtual Celebration on Sunday, January 17 at 3 pm Central.
This year's keynote speaker will be the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II, one of the leading voices for equality and social justice in our nation today, who will speak live from North Carolina.
More information about this virtual event is at go.illinois.edu/MLK2021. A link to watch the Sunday, January 17 celebration will be posted on this page and is open to the public.
The Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II is the President & Senior Lecturer of Repairers of the Breach and Co-Chair of the Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call For Moral Revival. Rev. Dr. Barber is also the architect of the Moral Movement, which began with weekly Moral Monday protests at the North Carolina General Assembly in 2013 and recently relaunched again online in August 2020 under the banner of the Poor People's Campaign, which was begun by Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968.
This year’s University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign celebration will also feature nearly three weeks of presentations, activities, and discussions reflecting on what it means to speak from a position of conscience. Due to current COVID-19 social distancing requirements, this year’s events will be virtual and open to all through online platforms. A full calendar of events is available online. Pre-registration may be required to receive links to some events.
During a year defined by COVID-19, the pandemic has directed a new light on the persistent and insidious twin crisis of systemic racism and generationally embedded racial disparities afflicting our society. This year’s celebration of the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. is a common and shared call to action for everyone in the community to commit to the hard work necessary to end racism and social injustice.
I hope that you will be able to join me in attending some of these events.
Sincerely,
Sean C. GarrickVice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion"

        Dear faculty and staff,
I hope you had a restful Winter Break after a challenging fall semester. I am so grateful to you for taking actions to protect our entire university community in the fall. Even with the promise of vaccinations, this is a critically important time to be vigilant about our COVID-19 guidelines. Below is a summary of information you will need to know in the coming weeks to maximize safety for everyone in the Spring 2021 semester. Here is the message we sent to all students with additional specific information.
COVID-19 TestingFaculty and staff who participate in any on-campus activities are required to continue their twice-per-week on-campus COVID-19 testing schedules. We are also encouraging all faculty and staff who travel away from campus to test immediately upon return and limit your activities to essential, such as attending work, testing, visiting the pharmacy and buying groceries, until you receive two negative on-campus test results if you are able to do so. See the current list of on-campus COVID-19 testing site locations here.
COVID-19 VaccinationsThe Illinois Department of Public Health is coordinating with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) to distribute COVID-19 vaccines for our community. More information about COVID-19 vaccinations can be found here.
Building AccessAs in the fall semester, Wellness Support Associates (WSA) may be stationed inside entrances to facilities where in-person classes are being held. At each WSA-staffed entrance, any individual (faculty, staff or student) who wishes to enter must show the WSA their building entry status with the Safer Illinois app or the Boarding Pass. More information about building access can be found here.
Quarantine & IsolationEmployees are required to comply with quarantine and isolation guidelines from the university and Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. Failure to follow these guidelines can result in disciplinary action. More information about quarantine and isolation can be found here.
Online COVID-19 TrainingAll faculty and staff who did not finish the COVID-19 online training previously are required to complete it before Monday, Jan. 25. I encourage everyone else to consider taking it again as a reminder.
Face Coverings & Social DistancingWe will continue to require everyone to practice social distancing on campus and to wear face coverings in university facilities unless they are alone in a private space. Face coverings are also required for outdoor campus spaces where sufficient social distancing is not possible.
I sincerely appreciate your understanding as we continue to make decisions and take actions to maximize the safety of our students, faculty, staff and greater community. I know how hard this has been for every single one of you reading this, and I am so proud to be part of a university where so many people make the well-being of others their top priority.

        Dear undergraduate and graduate students,
I hope you had a restful Winter Break after a challenging fall semester. I am so grateful to you for taking actions to protect our entire university community in the fall. Even with the promise of vaccinations, this is a critically important time to be vigilant about our COVID-19 guidelines. Below is a summary of information you will need to know in the coming weeks to maximize safety for everyone in the Spring 2021 semester.
COVID-19 Return Testing
All undergraduate and graduate students who are required to participate in the on-campus COVID-19 testing program will be required to receive two negative on-campus test results between Jan. 15-24, no sooner than three days apart. Students should begin testing as soon as they return to campus or in the community and participate only in essential activities, such as working and buying groceries, until they receive two negative on-campus test results.
Students are to follow these testing schedules upon returning to campus if they are able to do so:
Graduate students should test Jan. 15 & 19.
Seniors should test Jan. 15 & 19. (Seniors who live in University Housing should test Jan. 17 & 21.)
Juniors should test Jan. 16 & 20. (Juniors who live in University Housing should test Jan. 17 & 21.)
Sophomores should test Jan. 17 & 21.
Freshmen and new students should test Jan. 17 or 18 (their first day on campus or in the community) & 22.
Your building access status in the Safer Illinois app and the Boarding Pass will be set to “access denied” until you receive two negative on-campus test results, no closer than three days apart. To ensure building access by the first day of instruction, your second test should be on or before Jan. 22. Students who require access to buildings before they are able to receive two negative tests should coordinate a plan with their supervisors.
After receiving two negative tests, students should continue their twice-per-week on-campus COVID-19 testing schedules. See the current list of on-campus COVID-19 testing site locations here.
Please note students enrolled in fully online degree programs (see here for a listing of these programs) are not expected to participate in the on campus COVID-19 testing program.
COVID-19 VaccinationsThe Illinois Department of Public Health is coordinating with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) to distribute COVID-19 vaccines for our community. More information about COVID-19 vaccinations can be found here.
Building AccessAs in the fall semester, Wellness Support Associates (WSA) may be stationed inside entrances to facilities where in-person classes are being held. At each WSA-staffed entrance, any individual (faculty, staff or student) who wishes to enter must show the WSA their building access status with the Safer Illinois app or the Boarding Pass. More information about building access can be found here.
Positive Off-Campus COVID-19 ResultsUndergraduate and graduate students who test positive for COVID-19 at an off-campus location should submit their positive off-campus COVID-19 test result through the MyMcKinley Portal. Students who tested positive during the break should upload their results before Monday, Jan. 25, the first day of instruction.
Quarantine & IsolationStudents are required to comply with quarantine and isolation guidelines from the university and Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. More information about quarantine and isolation can be found here.
Online COVID-19 TrainingAll students who did not finish the COVID-19 online training previously for the Fall 2020 semester are required to complete it before the start of the Spring 2021 semester on Monday, Jan. 25. I encourage everyone else to consider taking it again as a reminder.
Face Coverings & Social DistancingWe will continue to require everyone to practice social distancing on campus and to wear face coverings in university facilities unless they are alone in a private space. Face coverings are also required for outdoor campus spaces where sufficient social distancing is not possible.
Spring 2021 ResidenceAll students are required to provide the address for where they are living during the Spring 2021 semester. You will receive an email from the Office of the Registrar this week with instructions for submitting your address.
Students who do not follow all COVID-related expectations face university disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. 
I sincerely appreciate your understanding as we continue to make decisions and take actions to maximize the safety of our students, faculty, staff and greater community. I know how hard this has been for every single one of you reading this, and I am so proud to be part of a university where so many people make the well-being of others their top priority.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,
Yesterday’s riot and the assault on the physical and symbolic center of our democratic nation were a disconcerting and chaotic beginning to the new year. We are all shaken and appalled by this attack on our sacred values and freedoms.
Freedom of expression and speech are bedrock principles of our democratic society and our university. Vigorous and even heated political debate is a welcome and necessary part of a democracy. Yesterday’s violence, threats, and carnage, however, are antithetical to the values, rights and protections established and guaranteed by our Constitution, undermine every aspect of our society and do irreparable damage to the community in which we all live and work and our stature in the world.
At the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, we will always encourage our students, faculty and staff to exercise the rights and freedoms that our nation’s Constitution protects. We expect all members of our community to exercise those freedoms with thoughtfulness, responsibility and respect for one another. Together, we can demonstrate to the nation and to the world how to express ourselves, even when we disagree, in a way that recognizes and celebrates the fundamental nature of democratic discourse.

Robert J. JonesChancellor

The test of the Illini-Alert system will use all of the communication capabilities of the emergency notification system:
Email messages will be sent to all active faculty and staff members and students with campus email addresses.
Text messages will be sent to those people who have registered their cellphone numbers.  
The Emergency Web Alert System will trigger a pop-up box on all campus websites.
A message will appear on the Illini-Alert Facebook account (http://www.facebook.com/illinialert).
A message will be sent to the Illini-Alert Twitter account (http://twitter.com/illinialert).

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
As you have likely heard, the first COVID-19 vaccine shipment has arrived in our community. The Illinois Department of Public Health is coordinating with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) to distribute the vaccines. CUPHD has told us that the university will likely receive its first allotment within the coming week. For more information, visit the CUPHD vaccination website here.   
Following guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we have plans in place for how the vaccines allotted to our campus will be offered and who will receive them first. Based on the CDC guidelines, our first community members to receive them will be healthcare workers. The university will then work through subsequent groups based on priority criteria.
CUPHD does not anticipate the vaccine being widely available until spring. If you are an employee, your unit will be contacted when you are eligible to receive a vaccine. Your unit will then communicate with you directly. If you are a student, you will be contacted by McKinley Health Center when you are eligible to receive a vaccine. Until then, please be patient while we work with CUPHD to offer the vaccine to as many people in our university community as we are able.
As we learn more information about COVID-19 federal, state and county vaccine plans, we will update the campus community as soon as we are able. Please continue to check the university COVID-19 vaccination page for the most updated information.
The distribution of a vaccine is welcome news, but we must still continue to be diligent as ever in safety precautions during the upcoming holiday season, including regular COVID-19 testing. Thank you in advance for your understanding and patience as we work through this next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                December 15, 2020 9:17 AM
			
        Dear Students, Staff and Faculty, 
This week,  the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign processed the one-millionth iteration of our unique saliva-based COVID-19 test since launching the program in July. You can read some more detailed reflections on that milestone and the path that led us to it here.
But with this message, we hope to remind you of the magnitude of what you have done together this semester and to simply say thank you.
This milestone is far more than an accumulation of lab results.
Every one of those million tests was a personal decision to protect friends, coworkers and complete strangers.
This is a celebration of one million times that those of you who chose to work or study in-person in this community also chose to put the safety and well-being of those around you first.
It is an irrefutable, loud and public demonstration of the commitment of our students, faculty and staff to make the very hard choices this pandemic has required of you time and time again.
It hasn’t always been smooth. We’ve had to constantly learn and adjust. But we ended the semester successfully. We saw no COVID-related hospitalizations among our students, faculty or staff, and no evidence of spread in classrooms – or to our employees from our students. Local hospitals and medical providers braced for a swell of COVID-19 cases among our students, but that didn’t happen.
Every member of our faculty and staff has been asked to rethink, realign and reimagine their roles and responsibilities to help us find ways to support our students and to keep our university moving forward when it matters the most. Thank you for demonstrating the power of our determination and commitment here at Illinois to find important and unexpected solutions on an unimaginable timeline.
Our SHIELD Team invented a new test, created a digital app and implemented a sophisticated modeling and analytics effort to guide and support it. Our testing site staff and Veterinary Diagnostic Lab staff worked seven days a week around the clock to deliver it to us all. Our Building Service Workers, Dining Service Workers and Housing staff worked even throughout the state’s stay-at-home order to continue delivering essential services and support to students, faculty and fellow staff members. Our counseling and health center professionals have had to reinvent their work and services. Our human resources and technology services operations have been asked to develop entirely new frameworks for support and services that did not exist. Faculty and instructors redesigned and adapted their courses.
We also want to express our profound gratitude for the leadership, collaboration and determination we have seen in action across Champaign County since last January, even before the COVID crisis had really reached us. From the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District to the mayors of Champaign, Urbana and Savoy to our county officials to our local business owners – we have worked together as partners in name and in true practice every step of the way. And that is why Champaign County is a national model for how truly engaged universities and communities strengthen each other – especially in difficult times. We are hopeful that the new year will bring us the ability to expand our own testing process to more members of our local community.
But, by far, the biggest debt of gratitude for the success of this semester is owed to our students. To you, our students, we acknowledge that this is not the college experience you wanted nor the one you deserve. You have worn your masks, maintained social distancing from friends, scheduled your days around testing site hours and given up so many of the social experiences you should have had to look after the safety and well-being of others. Our ability to come together and stay together this semester is thanks to your good choices and your perseverance. We are so very proud of your accomplishments. 
We know how hard this year has been. Many of our Illinois family who were not able to be here in-person this semester had to navigate remote experiences that brought a new collection of challenges. We miss them, and we thank them for their strength and patience. All of us have struggled with the isolation, the lack of easy human interaction, the pandemic fatigue. And many of us are grieving family and loved ones lost to the pandemic.
Thankfully, with a number of vaccines on the way, there is a hopeful light beginning to shine in this very long, dark tunnel in which we have traveled together. Still, we have some distance to go and we must continue to be vigilant and careful to make the hard choices that have helped all of us get so much further this semester at Illinois than many ever believed would be possible.
Wherever you are today, we wish you well in this last week of the semester and we hope you all have a safe winter break filled with family, friends, hope and well-earned rest.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

For those of you who returned to the local community to finish the semester, we hope you have found the additional study spaces we have opened to be helpful. You can find the full list of spaces with the days and times they are open here.
If you utilize these spaces, we do want to remind you that all of our current campus COVID-19 guidelines and rules must be followed at all times.
Building access status will be verified via the Safer Illinois App or a COVID-19 Boarding Pass.
Social distancing and face coverings are required.
You must adhere to the posted room capacity.
Please clean your seat and work space with the supplies provided when you leave.
Furniture cannot be moved within the room or to any other location.
Please be courteous and respectful to others using the rooms.
You must exit the building by the posted closing time or you will be considered to be trespassing.
We know this has been a semester unlike any other and we have depended on you to take care of one another and to adjust your experiences to address the restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic.
We have just a few more days to go together before you have a well-earned and deserved break.
We hope these additional safe, quiet study spaces are helpful in this last week. Please use them. And please, just as you have done all semester, use them in ways that keep your classmates, faculty and staff as safe as possible.

        Dear UIUC Student Body,
Thank you for pushing through this semester through all the stress, anxiety, and new challenges. You have made this community better by exhibiting your resilience and strength through adjusting to a new online format during a global pandemic.
I know you are tired, and that is okay. It’s normal to be worn out, drained, and lack motivation. As a student myself I face the struggles that all of you face each day. We never thought we would live through something like this. It has been the most challenging semester for our university and students, but you’re almost there. You did it, you are almost on the last lap of the semester. You can and will do it. While we move forward into the final weeks, I want to shed light amidst a sea of darkness and highlight what ISG has accomplished this semester. ISG is the official system of student governance at UIUC. We are the official representative body of all students, and our mission is to create a safe and welcoming campus, advocate for necessary changes, and maintain a high quality of life and education for students. We serve the student body in a time when advocacy is needed more than ever. We have worked tirelessly since the summer to be the voice of the students, and we want to share some of our accomplishments from the semester:
Police Reform
The Executive Branch has worked on police reform by having monthly meetings with Chief of Police Cary. These meetings allowed Vice-President Ackerman-Avilla and me to change official police standard operating guidelines which prevents police officers from entering classrooms unless they meet specific requirements
Academic Support for Students
Towards the end of the semester the Executive Branch and the Senate worked together to pass CR/NC through the UC Senate
The Executive Branch spoke with Provost Cangellaris, Chancellor Jones, and Vice Chancellor Young about the importance of supporting students through this difficult time by implementing CR/NC
Our efforts were heavily supported by students who shared their stories at UC Senate, pushing them to vote in favor of CR/NC
New Mascot Efforts
Through the whole semester, the Kingfisher Taskforce pushed for the adoption of the Belted Kingfisher to serve as the new University mascot. The committee has set a strong foundation by getting alumni support, speaking with outside organizations, growing the social media presence of the Kingfisher, and more. We welcome the recent Massmail announcing a series of steps in the right direction, but soon it will be time for the administration to take serious action by adopting the Belted Kingfisher as the official University mascot
Social Justice
ISG collaborated with Illinois-Coalition Assisting Undocumented Students’ Education to host a teach-in to shed light on the ways that anti-immigration policies impact the lives of those who pursue higher education daily.
In the fall, we partnered with Students for Environmental Concerns to host a teach-in about the importance of environmental justice and divesting from fossil fuels
ISG partnered with Students for Justice in Palestine and Black Students for Revolution to discuss the University investing in ethical companies
We have had several meetings with different administrators to increase funding for cultural houses, specifically, creating a Middle Eastern Northern African Cultural House, and provide better support to students of color on campus
Election Efforts
ISG partnered with the Student Illinois PIRG, Illini Union Board and Reaching Across Classes to host a fun voting trivia night to teach students about the different aspects of voting
Close to election week we hosted a March to the Polls where RSOs canvassed campus to increase voter turnout by reminding students to vote
ISG held a Political Dialogue series which included Illini Democrats, Illini Republicans, Illini Libertarians, and Young Democratic Socialists of America
Membership
Amazingly, diversity within ISG is at an all-time-high. Members come from all walks of life, which better assists the overall mission of ISG
Despite COVID-19 limiting what we are able to do, ISG has had a very high application rate with many competitive applicants applying to be part of ISG
Once again, I would truly like to reiterate my thankfulness for your ability to stay strong this semester despite the difficulties that we as a community have faced. It has been difficult, but luckily the semester is coming to an end and soon break will be approaching. Thank you for showing the country how strong our students and community are. You are all integral to the success of our University.
Sincerely,
Alexis PerezchicaStudent Body President"

        Dear undergraduate and graduate students,
We know many of you plan to be away from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign community during Winter Break. Because of this, there is a chance that you may test positive for COVID-19 at an off-campus location. If this happens, we request that you submit your positive off-campus COVID-19 test result through the MyMcKinley Portal.
How to submit your positive off-campus COVID-19 test result
Log into the MyMcKinley Portal.
Click on the “Upload” button on the right side of the menu header.
Choose “COVID-19 Outside Results/Notifications – Urbana-Champaign Campus Only” from the drop-down menu.
Upload your positive COVID-19 test result file.
Important notes
The university needs your positive off-campus results to speed the processing of any repeat positives once you return to campus.
The university needs your positive off-campus results to evaluate your testing requirements if you live in a location that is asked to test every other day. (Currently, individuals who have already tested positive and been released from isolation are not required to increase their testing requirements.)
We only want your positive off-campus test results. Please do not submit any negative results. Negative off-campus results do not replace any mandatory on-campus testing requirements for those who are in the Champaign-Urbana-Savoy area.
Please submit your results well ahead of the beginning of the Spring 2021 semester to ensure a smooth transition.
Thank you so much for all of your efforts to maximize our safety this semester. We hope once this semester is finished, you are able to enjoy a well-deserved break before restarting your classes, research or work.

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
We want you to be aware of a small change we are making to the on-campus COVID-19 saliva testing process. Currently, individuals are asked to provide a saliva sample into a large test tube. Beginning this week, individuals will be asked to use a straw to provide a saliva sample into a smaller test tube instead. The shift in process will provide benefits to our on-campus testing process, including:
A more efficient, automated process
Faster lab processing of test results
Fewer invalid/inconclusive results
Reduced plastic waste
On Monday, the CRCE COVID-19 testing site will begin using the new tubes. On Tuesday, the Veterinary Medicine COVID-19 testing site will begin using the new tubes. The university is planning to gradually transition all of the on-campus testing sites to the new tube size. Employees at the testing sites will explain how to use the straw and the smaller tube. The rest of the on-campus testing process will remain the same.
Please be sure to follow all of the regular recommendations for on-campus saliva testing. Please do not eat, drink, brush your teeth, use mouthwash or use tobacco product at least one hour prior to submitting your sample. Also, please make sure the sample you submit is saliva only. Thanks again for your participation and support of our SHIELD testing program.

                December 4, 2020 10:01 AM

        Dear Campus Community,
In Spring 2018, our campus invited over 600 students, staff, faculty, alumni and community members to engage in a conversation about the campus’s relationship to the Chief Illiniwek tradition. This “Chancellor’s Critical Conversations on Native Imagery” created space for everyone to come together and discuss what moving forward would mean to them. In Fall 2018, I designated a Commission on Native Imagery which delivered a thoughtful report citing areas of focus and next steps, focused on healing and reconciliation, establishing new traditions and strengthening relationships with Native Nations.
This past year, I charged working groups to take the Commission’s observations and develop an implementation plan. Today, I am pleased to announce the release of this implementation plan, along with the next steps our campus will be taking over the next three years. One of the most important aspects of the report is the centering of our responsibility to the Native Nations for whom the lands that now comprise the state of Illinois are home. Developing reciprocal, mutual relationships with these Native Nations is integral to our responsibility as an institution.
Some of the highlights of the Implementation Plan include:
In-State Tuition for Native Students: Starting Fall 2020, students who are enrolled as citizens of a federally recognized Tribal Nation can attend the university at the same rate as in-state students.
Relationships with Native Nations: The university will strengthen its partnership with the Peoria Tribe of Oklahoma, while also developing new relationships with other Native Nations who called Illinois home.
Permanent On-Campus Sites: The university will explore permanent structures that would acknowledge and represent Peoria and other Native Nations.
Repatriation of University’s Native American Collections to Tribal Communities and Lineal Descendants: The University’s Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation has begun coordinating activities in keeping with the requirements of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) to assist with repatriation of Native people’s remains, cultural items and sacred objects, which has included hiring the university’s first NAGPRA Program Officer.
Historic Account of Native Imagery: A campus historian is currently working on developing an accurate and thorough history of the campus’s use of Native symbols and imagery.
Indigenous Faculty Increase: In partnership with the American Indian Studies program, this report recommends hiring a cohort of faculty for this program, as well as hiring a tribal liaison, who will act as a conduit to Native American organizations and tribes.
New Traditions: The Illinois Spirit & Traditions Council, a new student council co-led by Student Affairs, the Division of Intercollegiate Athletics and the Alumni Association, will begin working to develop new traditions with members of the student body.
These working groups will be responsible for putting the observations from the Implementation Plan into action. Although these will not happen overnight, we have set a quick timeline to begin this work. My website will have updates on the progress of this work, as well as the full report.
It is time to implement a plan to create new traditions that reflect and include all members of our 21st century university community. The implementation plan provides a bridge from the past to the present—to fully remember the complex intent of the tradition while also accepting responsibility for its painful impact—and a vision for the future.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                December 3, 2020 2:24 PM
			
        Dear Colleagues,
I’m writing to announce a new Staff Voluntary Retirement Plan for Academic Professional and Civil Service employees who meet retirement eligibility by May 31, 2021. The goal of the plan is to provide an incentive opportunity and support our employees who may want to retire. Offering this plan will also help the university to navigate budget challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The application window for the plan will open today and will close Friday, Jan. 15, 2021. Eligible employees who wish to voluntarily retire and are accepted under the plan would receive a lump sum payment equal to 20 weeks of their current annual salary, up to a maximum payment of $75,000, less required deductions. For employees in union-represented bargaining units, eligibility shall be addressed through the required collective bargaining process.
Applications will be reviewed by units and Illinois Human Resources, and applicants will be officially notified of a decision in February 2021. For more information on the eligibility criteria, visit this Illinois Human Resources webpage. All eligible employees can expect to hear more details directly from Illinois Human Resources. There will also be a Staff Voluntary Retirement Plan informational session on Tuesday, Dec. 8 at noon. At that time, you can watch the livestream session here.
Please note the following staff members are not eligible for the plan:
Faculty
Staff members in positions funded 50% or greater by grant funds
Staff members in Illinois Fire Service Institute (due to special state appropriation)
Staff members in the Division of Intercollegiate Athletics
Staff members currently on notice of non-reappointment (NONR), unless the NONR is due to reclassification from academic professional to civil service
Employees currently in inactive status
System Offices employees
The plan is a positive strategic initiative to support employees who have served the university faithfully, while also navigating our current and future budget projections. If the plan is relevant and interesting to you, I hope you will explore the opportunity.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                December 3, 2020 6:01 AM
			
        Dear campus community member,
In order to maintain an effective emergency response and evacuation plan, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign recently completed a test including two components: a drill and an exercise. The annual test is designed to challenge our emergency response procedures and how we notify you of a threat to our campus community.
We are notifying you of these efforts to keep you informed about how we intend to protect our students, faculty, staff and visitors in the event of an emergency, and to comply with disclosure requirements outlined in federal law. No additional action on your part is required in response to this message.
On October 14, university stakeholders and emergency responders gathered virtually for a tabletop exercise from 9-11 a.m. Those involved were presented with a fictional scenario involving a civil demonstration that escalated and disrupted campus operations. The exercise tested various components of the Campus Emergency Operations Plan, including evacuation procedures.
For the second component, we initiated a test of our Illini-Alert emergency notification system on December 1. The drill was announced ahead of time by a mass email to campus and an Eweek notification to faculty and staff. The Illini-Alert was sent by email to the campus email addresses of all active students, faculty and staff. Those who have registered alternate email addresses also received a notification. Those who have registered a cellphone number were sent a text message during this drill.
Illini-Alert messages are also posted to Facebook, Twitter, digital signage and on campus websites through our Emergency Web Alert System. This approach increases the speed and breadth of our distribution of emergency notifications, and it provides a communication mechanism that will continue to function successfully even if one component fails to work properly.
This test was conducted to ensure we have a robust response plan in the event of a campus emergency, and that our emergency notifications will reach you in a timely and effective manner. If you have not signed up to receive emergency messages through Illini-Alert, please visit emergency.illinois.edu to register.
To view the University’s emergency response and evacuation procedures, please visit go.illinois.edu/EmergencyResponse. 
The University of Illinois Police Department is committed to maintaining a safe and secure campus environment where education, research and public service can flourish. We can only do so with the assistance of our community, and we hope this information is useful to all of our campus partners.
 
Sincerely,
Sherry Wooten

                November 23, 2020 4:48 PM
			
        Dear university community,
In response to advice and input from our students, and approval by the Academic Senate, we are implementing the following academic policy modifications for the Fall 2020 semester. These changes acknowledge the unique and challenging pandemic-related circumstances and the additional stress it has caused for students.
Drop Deadline
The deadline to drop a course without a grade of W and, for undergraduates, to use the campus Grade Replacement Policy, has been extended to 11:59 p.m. CST on Dec. 18, 2020.
This deadline applies to full semester, second eight-week courses and non-standard courses with an end date after Dec. 1, 2020.
Students who want to drop a course that has an end date before Dec. 1, 2020 should contact their academic advisor or college advising office to discuss available options.
Most course drops can be performed through Self-Service until 11:59 p.m. CST on Dec. 18, 2020, unless the drop puts the student below full-time enrollment status. Dropped courses at this point in the semester will not result in any refunds.

Credit/No Credit
The deadline to elect the Credit/No Credit grade mode has been extended to 11:59 p.m. CST Jan. 5, 2021.
Please note the timeline to select Credit/No Credit grading will be different than it was in the Spring 2020 semester; the deadline is after final grades are available.
As we are still working through the implementation details, the time window for students to select Credit/No Credit will not open immediately. Rest assured that all students will have an adequate opportunity to make the CR/NC selection, and the window for selection will extend beyond the end of the semester.
Election of Credit/No Credit for courses this term will not count toward applicable minimums as outlined in the Student Code Section 3-105.
For courses in which Credit/No Credit is elected and Credit is earned (letter grades of C- and higher), the credit is applicable towards major, minor and general education requirements.
Credit/No Credit is not available to DVM, JD or MD students due to professional licensure requirements.

In making decisions about dropping courses or the CR/NC option, consultation with academic advisors, college offices and the Office of Financial Aid for students receiving aid is strongly encouraged. As is always the case, students facing exceptionally difficult or unexpected circumstances that may require other accommodations continue to have the option to seek assistance through their college office.
We understand that this initial communication does not address all details or questions about these modifications and the implications. Please know we are working on a more detailed document and FAQ, which will be available on the Office of the Provost’s policies website. We thank the Academic Senate for their important and timely role in implementing these policy modifications.

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
Students who choose the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for their college education make that decision with an expectation that they will find the freedom and security to grow, to explore and to express their whole and best selves.
But, sadly, that is not the experience of all members of the student community. Anti-Semitic acts and expressions are all too common in our country and in our world, and examples of that intolerance have occurred at this university as well. This is unacceptable. While the university has taken measures in the past to address this problem, the university must do more.
Today, in collaboration with leaders in the Jewish community, we released a joint statement reaffirming our shared and common goal of creating a safe and welcoming environment for Jewish students and some actions that we will be taking towards that goal.

        Dear students, faculty and staff:
We are heading into the final weeks of a semester like none of us has ever experienced, one in which we have been tested in ways we could not have foreseen.
I write now with heartfelt gratitude for all the hard work you have done. You have faced this global crisis with innovation, adaptability and persistence.
And together, we have accomplished so much, building a bridge this fall toward the future we all want.
The saliva-based testing regimens and adherence to safety protocols have allowed tens of thousands of you to return to our three universities, to meet in our classrooms and labs, in person, taking part in the transformative experience that is a University of Illinois education.
As you walk across our campuses, you also see that face coverings and proper social distancing are widely in evidence.
Our rates of positive tests and numbers of cases have remained low. While state rates are now in double digits, our seven-day rate of positive tests stands at about 2.3 percent at the University of Illinois Chicago, 1.8 percent at the University of Illinois Springfield and still just 0.5 percent at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
Those numbers tell us our universities are among the safest places in the state, a model for how this can work.
Our protocols are also able to quickly identify and address potential problems. Our testing provided just such a signal this week at UIC and UIS, prompting a shift to virtual learning, albeit only briefly in Springfield, and for the remainder of the semester in Chicago, due to the sharp growth of cases in the city.
Throughout the fall, we have relied on a multidisciplinary approach to solve the myriad problems created by the pandemic. This has allowed us to address the medical demands while considering factors such as human behavior and risk-taking, and to explore the broad economic and social impacts of the virus.
Our universities have also found ways to nurture student life beyond the classroom: outdoor movie nights, virtual exercise classes and concerts.
Our approach to all of this has and will continue to evolve, just as our understanding of the virus constantly grows and changes.
We are again at an important juncture. With hope on the horizon in the form of our pioneering trials for vaccines and therapeutics to use against the coronavirus, we do not want to lose ground now.
Most immediately, we need everyone to follow the guidance coming from each of your universities – travel only if you must, continue to follow the testing program that remains foundational to your safety, cover your face and maintain social distance, work away from your campus if you can so that those who must be there can do so with less risk.
This is how we stay on that bridge we’ve built, pointed toward better times ahead.
Sincerely,
Tim"

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
We learned this week of a series of social media posts insulting the Muslim community. They had been made by an individual who worked part-time for our Office for Student Conflict Resolution. These posts are hurtful and antithetical to our university values of inclusivity and respect. They diminish all of us, lessen our sense of community and damage our connections with each other.
They demean our institution, and we condemn them without reservation or qualification.
That these comments were made by someone who worked for us is even more disappointing and embarrassing. This behavior is not acceptable in an office where trust, integrity and impartiality must be the bedrock of our conflict resolution process. This person performed data entry for incident reports. He was not involved in any evaluation, adjudication or decisions in the student disciplinary process. Regardless, our disciplinary system is built on a framework of honesty, respect and the promise of a fair and transparent process. The continued presence of this individual would undermine that trust and compromise our disciplinary process. As of yesterday afternoon, he is no longer employed by the university.
Our excellence as an institution is founded in creating a university that is welcoming to all people regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, political affiliation or socioeconomic background.
In a message expressing our values just two weeks ago, we said we are at our best when we engage in dialogue that encompasses the widest range of views and voices. We are free to dispute, debate and challenge ideas and opinions as we choose. But the university stands against Islamaophobia, racism and religious intolerance of any kind, and we recognize the lived experiences of everyone in our community. And we can always decide to place respect and tolerance above anger and resentment. 
This was not the choice made by the individual who posted these anti-Muslim messages. And because of that, many in our community are feeling less welcome and less at home.
All of us signing this message today extend our sincere apologies to our entire community, particularly those in our Muslim community, for the damage and pain these messages caused. You are welcome here, and we pledge to continue working to foster a supportive and safe environment for everyone who joins us at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Sincerely,

        Dear faculty and staff,
This message is to make you aware of a change in the way fees will be assessed for the Spring 2021 semester. The changes apply to students in campus-based degree programs and non-degree classes; a message with these changes was sent specifically to those enrolled in these programs or classes. Fee assessments for fully online programs remain unchanged.
A copy of the message distributed to students affected by this change can be found here.
 Most importantly, all students in on-campus degree programs will be assessed fees at the same rate, regardless of whether they are enrolled in a fully online schedule, and regardless of their location. 
This simplifies fee assessment and removes incentives to choose online instruction over in-person.  All students will receive a 30% fee reduction for the Spring 2021 semester.

        Dear faculty and staff,
We are entering another extremely dangerous period as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are rising rapidly in the state, with the state’s positivity rates reaching 11.4%. Cases are also increasing rapidly on our campus with the seven-day case positivity rate rising from 0.12% in mid-October to 0.62% today. We sent this message to undergraduates on Friday.
We are experiencing a concerning increase in cases among our faculty and staff. On Nov. 6, the seven-day positivity rate for faculty and staff had tripled to 0.72%, slightly higher than that of the undergraduates (0.7%). This is driven by the dramatic increase in the cases in East Central Illinois during this time period. From contact tracing, we can determine that this is not due to classroom or on-the-job transmission. The spread is likely to be through your household or social contacts.
I know that we all have pandemic fatigue, and this toll is weighing on all of us. However, we strongly believe this is a critically important time period for the safety of our entire community, and we need everyone to be more diligent than ever. I am asking that you take the following precautions beginning immediately as part of the Shield Surge plan:
Test Twice Per WeekIf you are currently participating in the on-campus COVID-19 testing program, please increase your testing frequency from once per week to twice per week, testing on Wednesday and Saturday or Wednesday and Sunday if possible. Please also test in the morning/early in the day if possible. Ensure you test and receive negative results at least every four days to maintain building access. Continue testing at this frequency until notified otherwise.
Work from Home if PossibleFor the next three weeks, please work with your supervisor to plan to work from home unless your work requires you to be on campus. Our goal is to reduce campus density to protect those who handle in-person instruction and other work that must be performed on-campus.
Participate in Essential Activities OnlyFor the next three weeks, stay home as much as possible, leaving only for essential activities, such as in-person teaching and other work that must be performed on campus, COVID-19 testing, visiting the pharmacy and buying groceries.
Limit Travel & GatheringsThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health experts tell us that gatherings and travel in and out of communities present a high risk of spreading the infection. In our current situation, with a rising prevalence in the surrounding regions, attending even small gatherings that mix households and traveling to and from the Champaign-Urbana area is not advised and is potentially dangerous. Please travel out of our community only if necessary. If you must travel, follow this travel guidance.
Thank you for your efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 in our community and for continuing to do your part to protect us all. I am so proud to be a part of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community.

                November 6, 2020 10:57 AM
			
        Dear students,
We are entering another extremely dangerous period as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are rising extraordinarily rapidly in our community and state. Cases are also increasing rapidly on our campus, primarily among undergraduates, with the seven-day case positivity rate rising from 0.12% in mid-October to 0.57% today. This past weekend saw gatherings associated with Halloween, football and no doubt other events: in two of the first three days of this week, we had more than 80 new cases. This is the first time that has happened since Labor Day. It is extremely important that you read this entire message and follow the updated guidelines below.
By not consistently wearing masks, minimizing social gatherings, properly washing hands and getting tested, your peers’ actions have led to a concerning and rapid increase in the number of new undergraduate COVID-19 positive cases very similar to the trend we saw in August and early September. That spread was quickly brought under control by the efforts of so many of you who recognized the danger and who made the sacrifices necessary to undo the damage.
And now, I have to ask you again to help us all make it safely through the end of our semester and to let us come back together in-person in the spring. Everyone needs to do their part to protect themselves and our community. If you travel for Fall Break, we are asking you to follow the guidelines below so you do not endanger the health of your family and friends back home.
Before Fall Break 
Do not have or attend parties. Parties spread COVID-19. The result is increased transmission, innocent people getting sick or hospitalized and the need for more regional and statewide mitigation steps that affect our local businesses and restaurants. For everyone’s sake, please do not hold or attend parties.
Starting Nov. 6 (today) through Nov. 20, students who plan to travel during Fall Break must limit themselves to essential activities only, such as attending in-person class, testing, visiting the pharmacy and buying groceries.
You must continue to test during this time.
If you test positive, you must comply with Champaign-Urbana Public Health District isolation/quarantine requirements and cooperate with their contact tracing staff.
Any students who violate university, state or local health and safety requirements are subject to student discipline.
After Fall Break 
If you travel away from the Champaign-Urbana-Savoy area for Fall Break you should not return to campus until the Spring semester. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health experts tell us that travel in and out of communities presents a high risk of spreading the infection.
If you must return to campus or the local community after Fall Break, you should test for COVID-19 as soon as possible after you return to campus and self-quarantine until your results are available. You then must test every other day until Dec. 18, the end of the Fall 2020 semester.
Students who return to or have remained in the community after Fall Break must limit themselves to essential activities only, such as testing, visiting the pharmacy and buying groceries through the end of the semester.
Some study spaces will be available on a first-come, first-serve basis for those who must return. Wellness Support Associates will be checking for building access status at the entrances of study spaces, fitness centers and other university facilities.
Students who will be on-campus or in the community during breaks are required to continue their regular COVID-19 testing schedule. Students who fail to follow our testing policies are subject to student discipline.
I am asking you to be more careful in taking precautions starting right now to minimize COVID-19 spread over the Thanksgiving holiday. Protect your friends, family and community by making safe decisions. If we do not address this on-campus trend right now, we will be forced to take more extreme measures before Fall Break.
I sincerely and honestly thank all of you who have worked so very hard this semester to make the difficult choices this pandemic has required. And I recognize that the stress and fatigue of this constant effort is a heavy weight to carry. But as you have demonstrated time and again since the beginning of this pandemic, the students who choose to be part of this community always come through in the most amazing ways when you work together.
Sincerely,
Robert. J. JonesChancellor"

                October 30, 2020 3:10 PM
			
        Dear faculty, staff and students,
Governor J.B. Pritzker announced today that beginning on Monday, Nov. 2 at 12 a.m., Region 6 will go into mitigation. Please note these measures will not require us to make any changes to in-person instruction, and we will continue courses as planned. See more information about mitigation restrictions here.
From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, as a university community, we have committed to remaining adaptable and transparent to maximize the safety of our entire community. On Monday, our on-campus COVID-19 testing recorded the highest number of new positive cases and the highest single-day positivity rate since the beginning of September. Meanwhile, the numbers in our surrounding communities have begun to rise significantly as the Midwest and Illinois experience a second wave of COVID-19.
We have a number of requirements currently in place, but I am writing to ask you to be even more vigilant in taking precautions starting right now, especially in your personal lives. If we do not come together now, we will be forced to take more extreme measures.
Prioritize Your Mental Health We know this is an incredibly difficult time, and the stress and uncertainty of the semester and ongoing pandemic continues to deeply affect us all. First and foremost, please do what you need to take care of your mental and emotional health. I know many of these COVID-19 safety measures are designed to take care of you physically, but for all of us, limiting our in-person contact with others has taken a toll. I encourage you to utilize our resources for students and resources for employees.
If You Test Positive, Follow the Law  Isolation as directed by the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) is mandatory. You should not leave your residence/isolation location after receiving a positive test result until you are notified you can do so by CUPHD. If you do not follow this guidance, you will be in violation of state law. Students, faculty and staff who fail to comply with these public health directives could be subject to disciplinary action.
Limit TravelThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health experts tell us that travel in and out of communities presents a high risk of spreading the infection. In our current situation, with a rising prevalence in the surrounding region and the Chicago area, traveling to and from the Champaign-Urbana area is not advised and is potentially dangerous. Please try to travel out of our community only if necessary. If you must travel, test a few days before your scheduled travel. Then get a campus saliva test immediately upon return, self-quarantine until you receive your results, and limit your activities to essential activities such as attending work, testing, visiting the pharmacy and buying groceries until you receive two negative on-campus test results no sooner than three days apart.
Test RegularlyEven if you are not required, we encourage you to use our on-campus COVID-19 testing facilities as a resource to keep you safe. If you are required, continue your mandatory testing protocol. We are considering increased testing frequency for certain groups if it is deemed necessary.
Be More Careful in Your Off-Campus Behavior Your behavior off-campus affects you and your entire community. Whether you are considering trick-or-treat activities, celebrating football season or gathering with a small group of friends, please prioritize safety above all else and follow local guidelines for gatherings. Continue to report parties that exceed authorized size limits or other unsafe actions through this web form or by emailing conflictresolution@illinois.edu when you become aware of them.
Consider Working from HomeIf your job responsibilities allow, please work with your supervisor to continue, or perhaps increase, a schedule to work from home. We are working with supervisors to continue to fully utilize remote work flexibility where possible. I encourage supervisors to talk with staff about possibilities for increased remote work.
I know this semester has not been easy. As we move into the home stretch of the semester, I want to say thank you. I know we are all feeling the mental, physical and emotional effects of the impacts of COVID-19. This has been enormously hard. We are all feeling that weight. We need to come together, now more than ever, to ensure we can continue to maximize the safety of the community and continue fulfilling our responsibilities as the state’s flagship university. Thank you for doing your part.
Sincerely,
Robert J. Jones Chancellor"

If you replied to a suspicious email or visited a link accidentally and later discovered it to be phishing, report it right away. State that you have been phished. You will not be in trouble; it happens, but you must report it in order to limit the effects. Log off all systems and promptly change your password using the self-service option as a precaution. https://go.illinois.edu/password
Dangerous links are often found in email, but they may also exist in compromised websites, online ads, and documents. If you see a fraudulent site pretending to be the University or any of its units, report it by emailing security@illinois.edu or calling (217) 265-0000.
To help you better spot a potential phishing or ransomware scam, please take a few moments to review these training modules from Technology Services Privacy and Security. Both are available at https://go.uillinois.edu/securitytraining.

                October 28, 2020 1:02 PM
			
        Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,
We are just a few days from an election that will help determine the next chapter in the governance in our local community, state and nation. Whatever the outcomes of this election, the deep divisions and differing perspectives we have seen will not simply disappear. But elections do offer an opportunity to step back, recalibrate and get a fresh start in finding common ground on issues that matter to every single one of us. Elections do not alter our respect for one another and human dignity that guides us here at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. And academic freedom and freedom of expression are core values.
Whether in the classroom, through scholarly exploration, on the floor of our Academic Senate, in the meetings of our student government or just walking the Quad – the free and open exchange of ideas and information is necessary for the advancement of democracy, the creation of new knowledge and the catalyst of discovery and innovation.
And it is the great diversity of our community that provides the perspectives, talents and life experiences that fuel our creativity and advance the deep, critical thinking that have established Illinois as a global educational leader. Our excellence is found in our success in creating a university that is welcoming to all people regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, political affiliation or socioeconomic background.
It is not uncommon for someone to express an idea that may anger, offend and even frighten us. And in these turbulent times, it is even easier to find a contentious topic to spark intense disagreement. But provocation does not necessarily advance a conversation toward common ground or to a shared solution. Our personal free expression need not diminish others.
We have an opportunity on Tuesday, Nov. 3 to deliver the most powerful personal expression offered to us in this country. All of our voices are equally loud and equally empowered when it comes to casting our ballots.
If you are eligible to vote in this election, we encourage you to exercise that right and make your voice heard on the issues that matter most to you. Early voting sites are now open on campus at the ARC, in the Illini Union and the University YMCA. All eligible voters can vote early and can vote at ANY of the early voting locations. You can find more information about hours and locations or to find your Election Day polling location by visiting this website. And please remember, the State of Illinois has designated Tuesday, Nov. 3 an official state holiday this year. Like other state holidays, the university will not hold any classes on that day. More information about the holiday operations can be found here.
We are at our best when we engage in dialogue that encompasses the widest range of views and voices. We will not and need not agree on every issue. We can, and should feel free to dispute, debate and challenge ideas and opinions as we choose. But we can always decide to do so in ways that preserve human dignity and recognize the lived experiences of others.
Disagreement and respect for those who disagree with us are not incompatible.
And showing compassion is always a choice we can make.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

        Dear students,
I know this semester has not been easy. We are all facing pandemic fatigue, and many of us are tired of living lives restricted by COVID-19. But just because we feel that way doesn’t mean the threat isn’t still real and pervasive.
I’m writing to remind you to continue to make choices that maximize the safety of our entire community this Halloween weekend. I encourage you to only participate and celebrate in ways that are safe and in compliance with university and CUPHD guidance. Student Affairs has planned some events, and you can view them here.
Any students who host or attend gatherings that violate state or local health and safety requirements are subject to student discipline. Since the beginning of the semester, more than 1,000 students have faced discipline, including dismissals for violations of COVID-19 policies.
Please continue to report parties that exceed authorized size limits or other unsafe actions through this web form or by emailing conflictresolution@illinois.edu when you become aware of them.
Please do not travel. The vigilance you show by staying on-campus will result in long-term gains for you and our entire campus community. The health and safety of each student, faculty and staff member is vital to our ability to finish the semester strong.
I’d also like to remind you to celebrate respectfully without engaging in inappropriate misrepresentations of cultures and minoritized communities. Avoid costumes that perpetuate cultural stereotypes, especially when it’s not your own culture. Avoid dressing in items that might be described as ""ethnic,” such as sombreros and ponchos, Native American headdresses, turbans and kimonos. It is also important to note that Blackface and Brownface are regarded as racist and insensitive.
Be considerate and refrain from making light of struggles many communities endure, such as deportation, genocide and sexual assault. Further, struggles such as homelessness or mental illness are harsh realities for many, not costumes to be taken on and off at will. Remember, although you may think it's just a costume or that you're exercising your right to freedom of expression, for many people, it's a trivialization of their culture.
We are so proud of your leadership this semester. Let’s keep progressing forward by making safe and smart decisions this weekend that respect our entire community.
Sincerely,
Dr. Danita M. B. YoungVice Chancellor for Student Affairs"

        Dear faculty and staff,  
Yesterday, after consultation with groups on campus and other universities, the Academic Senate approved the following changes to the Spring 2021 semester due to the impact of COVID-19:
Spring 2021 academic calendar changes
The first day of classes will now be Monday, Jan. 25.
There will be no Spring Break.
Three additional non-instruction days are being added: Feb. 17, March 24 and April 13.
We will be sending this message to all students announcing this change, along with additional guidance regarding our expectations for COVID-19 responsible etiquette and mandatory testing compliance in the time periods before and after Fall Break. While we would prefer to follow our regular academic calendar, including having Spring Break, the health and safety of our campus community will remain our number one priority, so we have made the adaptations listed above. The additional no-classes week at the beginning of the semester will allow the university to return our students as carefully as possible to help ensure they are in-compliance with mandatory COVID-19 testing before the semester begins.
Faculty and staff who work on-campus are encouraged to continue their regular COVID-19 testing schedule. We will continue to offer on-campus COVID-19 testing sites, even during breaks.
We are also encouraging all faculty and staff who plan to travel over the holidays to take the following precautions if they are able to do so:
Holiday travel guidance
When planning to travel, please limit yourself to essential activities like attending work and buying groceries for two weeks before you travel. This is to help protect you and your loved ones from possible virus spread. 
When you return, please test immediately upon return and limit your activities to essential activities such as attending work, testing, visiting the pharmacy and buying groceries until you receive two negative on-campus test results if you are able to do so. 
Thank you for continuing to do your part to help keep our community safe.
Sincerely,Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear undergraduate and graduate students,
Below are some important updates on new COVID-19 requirements and precautions we are taking in the next several months, with special instructions for those students who are required to participate in the on-campus COVID-19 testing program. There is also guidance on changes to the Spring 2021 schedule. Please read this entire message to be sure you understand what is expected of you.
We are so proud of your leadership in curbing the spread of the disease here, and we ask that you follow the protocols listed below to help us continue providing some level of on-campus experience during the pandemic.
Before Fall Break 
You must continue to test, use the Safer Illinois app or the Boarding Pass, and immediately quarantine or isolate yourself, and stay quarantined and isolated, if instructed to do so by Shield or the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District.
Students who plan to travel during Fall Break should limit themselves to essential activities only, such as attending in-person class, testing, visiting the pharmacy and buying groceries between Nov. 6 and Nov. 20. Limiting your activity may help you remain COVID-free before you return home and may help keep you and those you care about safe from possible virus spread.
Any students who host or attend gatherings that violate state or local health and safety requirements are subject to student discipline. Since the beginning of the semester more than 1,000 students have faced discipline, including dismissals, for violations of COVID-19 policies, including failure to participate in COVID-19 testing.
Continue to report parties that exceed authorized size limits or other unsafe actions through this web form or by emailing conflictresolution@illinois.edu when you become aware of them.
After Fall Break (for students who return to the campus or community)
We strongly urge that if you travel away from the Champaign-Urbana-Savoy area for the holiday, you should plan to remain away until you return for the Spring semester. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health experts tell us that travel in and out of communities presents a high risk of spreading the infection.
The University will finish the Fall semester fully online, with online instruction and exams after the Fall Break. Students who remain in town during Fall Break should participate in essential activities only. 
Students who return to campus or the local community after Fall Break should test for COVID-19 as soon as possible after they return to campus. Continue to check the COVID-19 website for the most up-to-date testing site locations and hours.
Students who return to or have remained in the community after Fall Break should limit themselves to essential activities only, such as testing, visiting the pharmacy and buying groceries through the end of the semester.
Some study spaces will be available on a first-come, first-served basis. Information about locations and hours will be posted on the COVID-19 website before Fall Break. Wellness Support Associates will be checking for building access compliance at the entrances. You must be up-to-date on your COVID-19 testing requirements.
Continue to report parties that exceed size limitations or other unsafe actions through this web form or by emailing conflictresolution@illinois.edu when you become aware of them.
Students who will be on-campus or in the community during breaks are required to continue their regular COVID-19 testing schedule. We will continue to offer on-campus COVID-19 testing sites even during breaks. Students who fail to follow our testing policies are subject to student discipline.
Spring 2021 Academic Calendar & Return Guidelines
The Spring 2021 Academic Calendar has changed:
The first day of classes will now be Monday, Jan. 25.
There will be no Spring Break.
Three additional non-instruction break days are being added: Feb. 17, March 24 and April 13.

Like the fall semester, the Spring 2021 semester will include a blend of in-person and remote instruction.
Students will be required to test for COVID-19 according to the following guidelines:
Any students who travel away from campus and return for the Spring 2021 semester should limit their activities to essential and begin on-campus COVID-19 testing as soon as they return to campus. Other than participation in essential activities, those students should not leave their residence until their first test result confirms they are COVID-19 negative.
All students (undergraduate and graduate students) who are living in the Champaign-Urbana-Savoy community will be required to receive two negative on-campus test results between Jan. 15-24, no sooner than three days apart. After two negative test results, students should follow standard testing protocols to maintain testing compliance.
Students should participate only in essential activities, such as buying groceries, until they receive two negative on-campus test results.

Students are to follow these testing schedules upon returning to campus if they are able to do so:
Graduate students should be tested on Jan. 15 & 19.
Seniors should be tested on Jan. 15 & 19. (Seniors who live in University Housing will test on Jan. 17 & 21.)
Juniors should be tested on Jan. 16 & 20. (Juniors who live in University Housing will test on Jan. 17 & 21.)
Sophomores should be tested on Jan. 17 & 21.
Freshmen and new students should be tested Jan. 18 & 22.

Please give yourself plenty of time to receive two negative test results and ensure your second test is on or before Jan. 22. Students who fail to follow our testing policies are subject to student discipline.
After receiving two negative tests, students should resume their regular testing schedule.
While we would prefer to follow our regular academic calendar, including having Spring Break, the health and safety of our campus community remains our number one priority, so we have made the adaptations listed above.
Thank you all for your patience and understanding this semester. We have done what many other universities in the country have not been able to do—come back to campus and stay together.
Thank you for continuing to do your part to help keep our community safe.

        Dear Members of the University Community, 
As chancellor, I write to you at the beginning of every academic year to reaffirm our university’s commitment to equal opportunity, affirmative action, and equal access. This commitment to create and maintain an equitable and just campus community is essential to upholding the most fundamental principles of academic freedom, equity, and human dignity, which are core to the mission of the University of Illinois. The diversity of our community and the perspectives, talents, and life experiences reflected within it fuel our creativity, advance deep, critical thinking, as well as the innovations needed to address racism and social disparities to improve the world and lives.  
University policies prohibit discrimination and harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, disability, national origin, citizenship status, ancestry, age, order of protection status, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, arrest record status, unfavorable discharge from the military or status as a protected veteran. These protections extend to all members of the campus community during any stage of the employment process. This includes, but is not limited to, recruitment, selection, promotion, transfer, merit increases, salary, training and development, demotion, and separation. Similarly, the university prohibits discrimination in admissions, enrollment, and provision of services, programs, and activities. 
As a part of our affirmative action plan, consistent with state and federal laws, we undertake good faith efforts to increase the representation of women, minorities, individuals with disabilities, and veterans among our faculty and staff. An affirmative action plan is essential to furthering equal employment opportunity and diversity on our campus, and to fulfill our affirmative action obligations. 
The Office for Access & Equity is available to assist any employees who have concerns about discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. You can submit a discrimination or harassment claim through the university’s online reporting portal (accessible claim form). To learn more about OAE’s broader services related to equity, affirmative action, and disability-related matters, please see the Office for Access & Equity website. You can also review the nondiscrimination policy and sexual misconduct policy  and procedures for addressing Title IX sexual harassment complaints online. Retaliation against any person for exercising their rights under these policies is strictly prohibited.  
The ADA Division of the Office for Access and Equity facilitates disability, religious, and pregnancy/parenting accommodations for all faculty, staff, undergraduate and graduate student employees, as well as job applicants. The ADA Division engages in an interactive process to determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation for each person. The division also provides advice, consultation, and educational programming to increase awareness and inclusion of individuals with diverse abilities. To request a reasonable accommodation, employees can complete the online employee accommodation request form (accessible reasonable accommodations request form). Students can learn more about the student academic supports and accommodations services that may be available to them by contacting the Division of Disability Resources & Educational Services.
We recently shared an update to the Title IX and Other Sexual Misconduct Policies and Procedures and want to reemphasize our commitment to providing prevention education and training, resources, and supportive measures to address sexual misconduct in our community. Please visit the We Care website to learn more about confidential and non-confidential resources, university policies, disciplinary procedures, rights and options, and additional information related to the prevention, reporting, and response to sexual misconduct. Questions regarding Title IX may also be sent to the U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights.  
Realizing our shared vision of an inclusive campus requires that we all annually reaffirm our individual commitment. We have a responsibility to act with courage, generosity, and boldness. Only together can we build a truly diverse, welcoming, and inclusive university community of students, scholars and staff. 
Sincerely, 
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

Dear Students,
We hope that you are well, and the semester has been off to a smooth start. Last fall, the campus launched the Student Success Initiative. Chancellor Jones noted the Student Success Initiative is an effort to better identify the factors that lead to positive and productive experiences for our undergraduate students. Last year we gathered valuable data from faculty, staff, and students! This year, our focus will be on using the data collected and recommendations to implement change on campus.
We are seeking a diverse group of students to serve on our Provost Undergraduate Student Advisory Board. We hope you will consider applying to be involved in providing additional feedback and helping us to operationalize the recommendations provided through their lens. Student voice is a critical part of student success; thus, we need your valuable input to continue improving our campus community. 
View the application and frequently asked questions. If selected to participate as a Board member, appointments will be for one full academic year. All applications will be due by Friday, October 9, 2020 at 11:59pm CDT.
We genuinely appreciate your consideration!

        Dear Colleagues,
We are pleased to announce the release of a brief video resource about campus sustainability from the Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment (iSEE).
This informational video will appear on the University of Illinois System Ethics and Compliance website in conjunction with the annual faculty and staff ethics training. It will also be posted to the Illinois Media Space for use in your courses and beyond. By participating in this module, you will receive:
A general overview of several campus sustainability goals
Pertinent information about the Illinois Climate Action Plan (iCAP) 2020
Best practices for incorporating our campus-wide sustainability commitments into daily life
Following the video, you are invited to provide feedback about how the university can continue reducing campus waste, energy consumption and carbon emissions.
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is a model for sustainability. It is our goal to continue leading by example and pursuing progressive solutions. We are proud of our accomplishments while also recognizing there is more we must do.
At an individual level, you too can model sustainable decision-making for your peers and make choices that impact the campus and community, such as: reducing food waste, avoiding single-use items and choosing to take, use and purchase no more than what is needed.
Our resources are valuable, and now is a critical time to make a personal commitment to each do our part to preserve and sustain them.
We hope you will take a few minutes to watch this video, respond to the questions and become more involved in campus sustainability opportunities.
Our actions do make a measureable difference.

Robert J. JonesChancellor

        Dear campus community member:
Each year around this time, we publish our Annual Security and Fire Safety Report which includes statistics from the previous three years concerning crime that occurred on campus, in certain off-campus buildings or on property owned or controlled by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The report additionally includes statistics for fires which occurred in on-campus student housing, fire safety policies and procedures, institutional policies concerning campus security, and other safety information.
Creating and maintaining a safe community is a responsibility that the University of Illinois Police Department and Campus Code Compliance and Fire Safety take very seriously. However, we cannot do it alone. Crime and fire prevention is a community effort, and you are our most valuable public safety resource. By reviewing this report, you are partnering with us to take the necessary steps to look out for yourself and others and to create a safer campus community for everyone.
Toward this end, and in compliance with federal regulations and the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Crime Statistics Act, a copy of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Annual Security and Fire Safety Report is available online at police.illinois.edu/clery.
A hard copy of the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report may be obtained by visiting the U. of I. Public Safety Building at 1110 W. Springfield Ave., Urbana, IL 61801, or by contacting 217-333-1216. You may also review the Daily Crime Log at the front desk of the U. of I. Public Safety Building or online at police.illinois.edu/crime-reporting/daily-crime-log.
In addition to reviewing this report, there are other important steps you can take to enhance your own safety on campus:
Sign up for Illini-Alert text messages by visiting emergency.illinois.edu.
Review campus safety measures at police.illinois.edu/safety.
Take a minute to prepare for emergencies at police.illinois.edu/safe.
Review sexual violence and misconduct resources available to the campus community at wecare.illinois.edu.
We hope that you review these important resources and use the information to promote your own awareness. Together, we can continue to make the campus community a safer place where education, research and public service can flourish.
Sincerely,
Alice CaryExecutive Director of Public Safety/Chief of Police

As we continue to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19, I am asking you to take one more step to maximize the safety of our entire community. Please, get a flu shot. This is an extremely important year to prioritize getting your flu vaccination to help ensure we are each doing what we can to support our local healthcare system, so they can allocate their resources to fighting COVID-19. It is our goal to have everyone in our university community get a flu shot before the end of October. Consider taking this simple action to protect yourself and others.
McKinley Health Center is providing free flu shots to all students who have paid the Health Service Fee. The seasonal flu shot is also available to benefit eligible faculty, staff and retirees. There are several locations across campus between now and the end of October:
Campus Recreation Center East (CRCE)Now-Nov. 20 (Monday-Friday)
Activities & Recreation Center (ARC)Sept. 28-30
Grainger Engineering LibraryOct. 5-8
Business Instructional Facility (BIF)Oct. 12-15
Veterinary Medicine Oct. 20-21

Click here for hours & more details.
To learn more about who is eligible, times, locations and components of the vaccine, please visit the McKinley Health Center website. If you plan to come to campus, please keep in mind that you must be up-to-date on your COVID-19 on-campus testing.
If you are a faculty or staff member, and it is more convenient to get a flu shot off-campus, please consider doing so. Carle Hospital and Christie Clinic are both offering flu shots for patients.
Thank you for doing your part to help protect our community.

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:
I would like to share the details about the next step in our university’s Call to Action to Address Racism and Social Injustice with you. I have charged a Steering Committee and four working groups to identify the work that we must commit to now in order to create a campus that is free of structural and systemic racism and bias. The Steering Committee aims to place our institutional values of diversity, equity, and inclusion at the heart of every aspect of what we do as an institution. We will not generate another list of what should change. Instead we will develop the frameworks, the concrete steps that we will take, the tangible goals that we will meet, and the barriers we will remove to create the foundation for lasting, positive systemic change throughout the University of Illinois.
These are the committees that have been charged:
Steering Committee (Chair: Vice Chancellor Sean Garrick)View the Steering Committee charge letter and members
Teaching and Scholarship (Chairs: Dean James Anderson and Vice Provost Kevin Pitts) View the Teaching and Scholarship charge letter and members
Diversity and a Culture of Inclusion (Chairs: Humanities Research Institute Director Antoinette Burton and Dean Kevin Hamilton) View the Diversity and a Culture of Inclusion charge letter and members

Community Action and Public Engagement (Chairs: Executive Associate Chancellor Wanda Ward and Vice Chancellor Danita Brown Young)View the Community Action and Public Engagement charge letter and members
It is now time for this university to place our deep abundance of knowledge, will, and expertise into motion to change the assumptions that inform our decisions to consider the necessary and difficult questions that we need to ask of ourselves as a university. Who are we not listening to? Who are we failing to serve? How must we reallocate both our attention and our resources? Only then will we fundamentally restructure the way we educate our community of scholars, reimagine how we understand our responsibilities to protect one another, establish shared community norms of inclusion, as well as use the knowledge of our university experts to partner with the people of Champaign-Urbana and serve the public good.
I have requested to receive a final report from the steering committee by June 1, 2021.

With an election rapidly approaching and the 2020 census drawing to a conclusion, we are living at an important time of substantial civic responsibility that gives us the opportunity to help shape the state and nation.
We encourage all eligible students, faculty and staff to register to vote in the Nov. 3 national and local elections, and to participate in the 2020 census to help ensure an accurate count of our nation’s population. Early voting begins in Illinois tomorrow and is already underway in other areas of the country. And there is still time to complete the census by the Sept. 30 deadline and ensure that the areas in which we live are fairly represented in Congress and receive their share of vital federal funding.

2020-09-20T09:52:00Z,2020-09-20,9:52,76652,Campus Safety Notice,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/2059427497.html,"Campus Safety Notice
                
                September 20, 2020 10:01 AM

        Dear campus community member:
We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, you can view the daily crime log.
Within the past three weeks, three vehicles have been reported stolen from the area of Green and Sixth streets, Champaign. In at least one of the incidents, the vehicle was left running and unattended:
Aug. 30: Vehicle stolen near Green and Sixth streets.
Sept. 5: Vehicle stolen at 616 E. Green St.
Sept. 19: Vehicle stolen at 606 S. Sixth St.
We are aware of additional reports of stolen vehicles in off-campus areas, though it is not clear if the incidents are related to each other. While we do not have reason to believe these incidents present a threat to anyone’s physical safety, we felt it important to issue this notice in order to prevent similar crimes from occurring. Please keep your vehicle locked at all times, and report any suspicious activity you might have witnessed. Additional crime prevention tips are listed below.
The University of Illinois Police Department, in cooperation with the Champaign Police Department and the Urbana Police Department, has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area. Between these agencies, our campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 2,100 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information is encouraged to contact the Champaign Police Department at 217-351-4545. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android. All messages to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of identifying information and forwarded to police by an independent third party.
This is our community. Let's stay together.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Watch your belongings. Theft is the most common crime on college campuses everywhere, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is no exception. Lock up or secure your personal belongings whenever possible, even if they are sitting right next to you. Do not leave your vehicle running if it is unattended.
Lock your doors. The easiest way to prevent theft and burglary is by locking the door to your vehicle or residence. Criminals often will look for an open door or window to steal your items.
Hide it, or better yet, bring it with you. Do not leave valuables in plain sight, and never leave car keys with the vehicle. Make sure to hide valuables if you have to leave them in the car, or do not leave them in the car at all.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.

        Dear Students,
On September 2, I asked you to limit your in-person activities for two weeks to quickly reverse a concerning increase in positive cases. We have made some progress in that time, and our new case numbers and positivity rate are moving down. But, we are still very much at a tipping point, and new cases could quickly and completely erase all of your progress and hard work. 
While we can’t yet celebrate, you will be able to carefully and responsibly resume some COVID-19-limited versions of activities you all miss.
So, in eight words, here are the rules I’m going to ask you to follow for the next few weeks. I can say the words, but, as always, it is your actions that will make the difference.
No parties. Small, safe gatherings only. Smart decisions.
Limit gatherings to 10 people or fewer, have them outside if possible and always with social distancing and face coverings.
Continue to report large parties or other unsafe actions through this web form or by emailing conflictresolution@illinois.edu when you see them.
You must continue to test twice a week, use the Safer Illinois app or the Boarding Pass, and immediately quarantine or isolate yourself, and stay quarantined and isolated, if instructed to do so.
Some of you will be asked to begin testing three times a week, if we determine you are at a high risk for contracting COVID-19.
You must follow any directions you receive from the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. Ignoring or violating CUPHD is not just dangerous, it is breaking the law and could result in suspension from the university.
Avoid crowded places, especially in enclosed spaces – whether parties, private houses or apartments – where exposure to the virus is more likely.
Don’t risk your health by going to businesses that aren’t following public health guidelines about face coverings, occupancy limits or social distancing.
I ask that you follow these rules whether you are on campus or off campus and whether it is 8 in the morning or 11:30 at night.
There is no shortage of recent, national stories about super-spreader events. One infected person, without a mask, talking loudly, in a crowded place can start a chain of transmission that can lead to hundreds of people infected and deaths of those who were not even there. This has happened at weddings, funerals, parties, on buses and in restaurants. It can happen right here. And if it does, your sacrifices of the past couple of weeks will have been wasted.
You came back this semester because you wanted the kind of in-person experiences – in and out of the classroom – that college life should include. We are going to do something about those out-of-class experiences, starting right now and on a scale a little more like we are used to here at Illinois.
Introducing new in-person campus events 
Student Affairs is working together with the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics and a number of RSOs to launch a series of new in-person events.
These kick off at 9 p.m. this Friday with a double feature movie night on the Memorial Stadium screen.
Saturday night will feature a live, free concert from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m.
Starting next week, every Thursday will be another double feature night, and every Friday and Saturday will feature live entertainment in the stadium.
Attendance at all of these events will be limited according to local and state rules on allowable occupancy and the ability to maintain social distancing. Face coverings will be required.
Visit go.illinois.edu/activities for details about the events organized by the Illini Union Board, Campus Recreation and other campus groups, the new ones that will be added all semester, as well as the rules that will be in place for every event.
We are going to be asking you for more ideas about how we can help you connect safely, and our Wellness Ambassadors will be out on campus sharing small rewards with students who are following good COVID-19 safety practices.
You have made it clear by your decisions these past two weeks that you are committed to staying together this semester. Please don’t let up now. We will continue to monitor the data and reassess our approach quickly as necessary.
I know how frustrating this is. It is not normal.
And with every single day, my respect and admiration for you grows as I watch you rise to whatever the next challenge may be.
Thank you, and please keep up the very hard work.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Colleagues,
I will be sending the massmail message below to our undergraduate students later today. Over these past two weeks, their efforts to limit themselves to essential activities has led to an encouraging drop in new cases and in our positivity rate. Because of this progress we are allowing them to carefully and responsibly resume some COVID-19-limited in-person activities. We are also announcing a series of campus-organized events to offer our students more opportunities to safely come together throughout the rest of the semester.
We will also continue our efforts to quickly identify and discipline students who are not complying with our COVID-19 rules or with Champaign-Urbana Public Health District orders.
We have seen a reversal in the upward trend in cases, but we will continue to monitor our testing data and reassess our approach as necessary. We will always be prepared to move quickly and decisively to transition the rest of the semester to fully remote instruction if necessary.
The vast majority of our undergraduate students are doing what we ask and are making the smart, daily decisions that will let us continue our in-person semester.
I am very proud of their efforts and of their collective commitment to taking care of our entire community.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

                September 15, 2020 4:19 PM

        Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,
As we shared in a message to the university community in May, the U.S. Department of Education released new regulations to guide the application of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which protects persons from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance. Our position since May has not wavered: federal regulations may change, but our collective responsibility to prevent and respond to sexual misconduct extends well beyond minimum compliance. As we embark on a new academic year, the University of Illinois remains fully committed to the goal of preventing and responding to sexual misconduct.
Today, we write to let you know about the new formal investigation and resolution processes that are now in place in compliance with the new Title IX regulations. The new regulations focus on a narrowed range of conduct and define the process that we must follow. For this range of conduct, a team of campus experts worked throughout the summer to implement new procedures—including a fair and equitable live hearing with cross-examination—in a manner that is attentive toward caring for survivors and providing supportive measures for educational access. A full description of the new policy, process, and information about reporting obligations, as well as the provision of confidential advisors under Title IX, is maintained centrally on the We Care: Sexual Misconduct Support, Response, and Prevention website.
Danielle Morrison, our university’s Title IX Coordinator, provides oversight and support for the university’s comprehensive Title IX programs and initiatives. Dr. Morrison can be reached at titleixcoordinator@illinois.edu or (844) 616-7978.
The work to prevent and respond to sexual misconduct in our university community does not stop with the implementation of new Title IX processes. Beyond the conduct covered by the new regulations, the U.S. Department of Education also allows each university to define broader categories of behavior to which we will hold the members of our community responsible.
The Sexual Misconduct Policy in the Campus Administrative Manual and Student Code has therefore been revised to include other prohibited sexual misconduct in addition to Title IX Sexual Harassment. These policies are based on a comprehensive understanding of the ways that sexual misconduct undermines the educational, research, and service missions of the University and reflect the work of the Committee on Faculty Sexual Misconduct and other campus stakeholders. We are committed to ensuring that the campus community is safe from all forms of sexual misconduct, and we will continue to enhance and expand on these processes so that we may uphold the expectations of our university and our shared values.
An updated statement regarding the U.S. Department of Education’s new regulations was published by the University of Illinois System on August 14, 2020: University of Illinois System Statement on Sex Discrimination, Sexual Harassment and Other Sexual Misconduct.
Regardless of where you are this academic year, either on campus in Urbana-Champaign or remote across the globe, we want you to know that you can still receive support if you need it. Anyone who experiences sexual misconduct — including sexual harassment, sexual assault, and other forms of sexual violence — should know that you are not alone, and that help is available. We encourage all students, faculty, and staff to learn more, stand up against harmful behavior, and get involved in our effort to create and maintain a safe and respectful campus community.
Sincerely,

          Dear colleagues:
I’m pleased to announce the start of something new and exciting from the University of Illinois System.
The U of I System is introducing “Rising to the Challenge,” a new podcast dedicated to telling stories from across the system and our universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield.
Like few other times in our history, we are being called on now to meet myriad challenges. And I believe the stories behind just how those tests are being met can and will inspire and inform all of us.
How do you create a fast, new saliva-based test to detect COVID-19 and change the thinking about what’s possible as we work to restore the educational, economic and social life of our universities, our state and our country? What’s involved in creating a new vaccine that can help us do all of that? And how do we meet the long list of other challenges created by a pandemic?
Our first few episodes will tell the stories behind those questions and many more.
The podcast is being produced in cooperation with Illinois Public Media and will be hosted by Gwen Macsai, an award-winning veteran of audio storytelling who is based in Chicago. Producer Libby Foster is an award-winning journalist also based in Chicago and formerly of Illinois Public Media’s ""The 21st"" talk show. Both are graduates of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
You can find “Rising to the Challenge” at WILL, our partner in this endeavor, as well as on Apple and Google podcasts, and Spotify.
I hope you'll find the podcast interesting and inspiring.
Sincerely,Tim"

                September 15, 2020 12:22 AM

        Dear campus community member:
We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This Campus Safety Notice is issued in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about crime to aid in the prevention of similar crimes and to assist in the identification of offenders.
This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, you can view the daily crime log.
The following robbery took place at 11:12 p.m. on Monday, Sept. 14, in the 200 block of East Gregory Drive (map), in Champaign:
A U. of I. student was approached by four men who pushed the student to the ground and took the student’s cash and other property. The group then ran to the north. No one appeared to have a weapon. The student was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.
The University of Illinois Police Department, in cooperation with the Champaign Police Department and the Urbana Police Department, has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area. Between these agencies, our campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 2,000 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android. All messages to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of identifying information and forwarded to police by an independent third party.
Our community. Our safety.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks escort if you need one.
Be alert. Maintaining awareness of your surroundings is critical, especially when traveling at night. Wearing headphones or looking at your phone diminishes your ability to respond to your surroundings. Walk with purpose, and stay attentive.
Trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.
If you choose to consume alcohol, please be responsible. Remember your ability to respond is diminished by overconsumption of alcohol.

                September 7, 2020 7:04 PM

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
We want to thank the many students who have followed the guidelines Chancellor Jones established last week to curb the spread of COVID-19. Our collective efforts this past week are showing encouraging results, and we must continue that momentum in the weeks ahead.
We are writing today to share that data collected from the start of on-campus Shield saliva testing system show two findings that allow us to move to a more targeted testing approach to expedite the detection of positive cases and more quickly contain the spread of COVID-19. Since testing began over the summer, our Shield program has been highly effective at detecting and isolating cases among faculty, staff and graduate students, and we know the number of cases among those groups is extremely low. At this point, more than 95% of all new cases are among undergraduate students.
For those reasons, beginning tomorrow, Tuesday, Sept. 8:
For Faculty, Staff and Graduate Students:
For this week only, we ask that you refrain from getting tested tomorrow, Tuesday, Sept. 8. 
All faculty, staff and graduate students will now move to a once-per-week test schedule. Even though not required, you may continue on a twice-weekly schedule if you choose. 
If at all possible, please test on Saturdays or Sundays. If weekends are not possible for you, please test on Wednesdays. This will help even the number of tests to be processed each day and will mean shorter lines and faster results for everyone. 
Faculty, staff and graduate students must still show a Wellness Support Associate their Safer Illinois app or Boarding Pass at building entrances. WSAs will work to implement this change. You should also bring your i-card to show you are part of this testing group. 

For Undergraduate Students:
You must continue your twice-per-week test schedule. You can choose Monday-Thursday, Tuesday-Friday, or Wednesday-Saturday/Sunday, schedules. Undergraduate students must still show a Wellness Support Associate their Safer Illinois app or Boarding Pass at building entrances.
Some undergraduate students may be directly contacted and asked to test three times a week if we believe you might have a higher risk of recent exposure. 

This new more targeted approach will provide test results more quickly and will allow the university to connect those students with information and resources more quickly upon receiving a positive test.
We are confident these adjustments in our testing schedule will help us further reduce our positivity rate and show the world that our innovative approach can help us all move forward together in these challenging times.

We need to reduce the time it takes to return COVID-19 test results. So, if you are willing to test this Saturday or Sunday and then continue to test on a Wednesday-weekend schedule, you can help relieve overwhelming demand on the processing center on the highest-demand days (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday). Several testing locations across campus are open over the holiday weekend.
With this small modification in testing scheduled, we can even the flow of testing throughout the week and make our program stronger for everyone.

          Dear students, faculty and staff:
We began the fall semester with what we believe are the right tools to come back to campus: a strict regimen of COVID-19 testing using the rapid-result SHIELD test developed by our own scientists and a set of common-sense guidelines to help everyone avoid the most risky situations.
It became clear this week through a rise in COVID-19 cases that some students at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have not been adhering to those guidelines.
In response, Chancellor Robert Jones is taking the difficult-but-necessary step of identifying and even removing those who decline to make the sacrifices required to allow all of us to stay on campus this fall.
The chancellor and the leadership team at Urbana-Champaign also have implored students to limit their activities over the next two weeks to only the absolute essentials: twice-weekly SHIELD COVID-19 tests, classes, buying groceries and food, going to work, individual outdoor activity, religious services and seeking medical attention.
These are manageable, short-term sacrifices, steps not unlike those being taken by people around the globe right now as we navigate the pandemic.
These short-range steps have the power to keep us all here. But without them, the partially in-person fall semester that we’ve begun is at risk.
So please, take this seriously.
The world is watching the University of Illinois System right now, wondering if we are capable of managing this virus. We are, with everyone’s commitment and involvement. 
Sincerely,
Tim KilleenPresident, University of Illinois System

        Dear Students and Employees,
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act requires the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:
http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/
The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.
Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to marijuana in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s marijuana prohibition.
The university’s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.
The university’s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.
Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. University employees should contact Illinois Human Resources at (217) 333-2137.
Sincerely,
Dr. Danita M. B. YoungVice Chancellor for Student Affairs"

        Dear Students,
Wednesday afternoon, the Chancellor sent an email to all undergraduate students concerning the Increased Enforcement of COVID-19 Safety Guidelines. In the email, Chancellor Jones directed students to avoid traveling or attending large gatherings over the Labor Day weekend. Many of our positive cases these first two weeks were brought from communities without the level of testing we have.
I am writing to echo his instruction. Do not travel this holiday weekend. The vigilance you show by staying on-campus will result in long-term gains for you and our entire campus community. As an Illini family, the health and safety of each student, faculty, and staff member is vital to our ability to remain on-campus through the duration of the semester.
As you limit your in-person interactions to only the most essential activities, please know that there is still plenty for you to do; here are some ideas:
Check out these virtual and on-campus activities.
Also be sure to view Student Affairs’ COVID-19 Support Resources for a listing of facilities and their availability as well as websites for your favorite campus locations to find activities you can participate in.
If you must travel, please limit interactions to only those in your immediate family unit. Once you return to the community, go as soon as possible to a testing site, and take a COVID-19 test. While you wait for your results, be cautious and limit time spent outside of your residence, continue wearing your face covering and social distancing in public areas, and continue washing your hands multiple times per day.
Remember, all students need to take a COVID-19 test and receive a negative result in order to regain access to academic buildings.
To quote the Chancellor, “We’ve given ourselves a real chance to come together and to stay together. But the decision to do so is in your hands.”
Be well, be safe, and please choose to stay on-campus over the Labor Day weekend.
Sincerely,
Dr. Danita M. B. YoungVice Chancellor for Student Affairs"

                September 2, 2020 1:16 PM

        Dear Students,
Over these past few days, the irresponsible actions of a small number of students have created the very real possibility of ending an in-person semester for all of us. Their poor choices have led to a concerning and rapid increase in the number of new undergraduate COVID-19 positive cases. We know the majority of you reading this message are following the university’s COVID-19 guidance, and we are grateful to all of you who have worked so hard to help by doing your part.
For two weeks, starting now, we are intensifying our efforts to identify and swiftly remove those individuals who have created this unacceptable risk for our campus and community and who have undermined your hard work to stay together. Students who continue to violate our safety policies, who fail to comply with directions from our public health officials and who engage in unsafe activities that risk spreading the virus will be asked to leave this university. 
We believe the damage done by these individuals can be reversed. But it must be done quickly. And it will require those of you who have been working so hard this semester to shoulder even more responsibility in these next two weeks.
For two weeks, starting today at 5 p.m., for your own protection, we expect all undergraduate students to limit their in-person interactions to only the most essential activities. These include things like taking twice weekly COVID-19 tests, attending class, purchasing groceries and food, going to work, engaging in individual outdoor activity, attending religious services and seeking medical attention.
And here is the hardest part. We need you to strictly avoid social gatherings under any circumstances for these two weeks. We know what we are asking with this. Being together with friends is a big part of why you chose to come back. And for our freshmen, opening your college experience with the same isolation that ended your high school career is intensely disappointing.
It is not fair that you will be the ones to fix a situation you did not cause. But this is where we are now, and this is what it will take to repair the damage in time to break the cycle of increasing new cases. Two weeks now gives you the chance for the rest of the semester together. Why Are We Doing This Now?
Real-time data from our Shield testing program allowed us to quickly detect a rapidly emerging increase in positive cases that will force us to return to fully remote instruction for the rest of the semester if we do not take immediate action to break the cycle.
Some students have ignored the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) directives to isolate or quarantine, choosing to go out even knowing they are positive for the virus.
Some students who have tested positive are actively avoiding our contact tracers and some have repeatedly returned to testing facilities attempting to “test out” of their positive status, which is not permissible under CUPHD protocols.
Some students have made active efforts to circumvent the Safer Illinois app.
Over the weekend, we received 11 complaints about large gatherings inside fraternities and private houses.
Over the weekend, we responded to more than 100 party-related calls.
The university has identified more than 400 new positive cases since the first day of instruction, Aug. 24, and about twice as many individuals are currently in quarantine. The number of new cases we have seen in the past several days has been progressing at a rate that will double every seven days without the actions we are asking of you.
Discipline for Non-Compliance & Dangerous Behavior
For the first week of classes, we focused on education, but now we are focusing on the individuals who are endangering everyone in our community. Here are some of the actions already taken to address these issues:
A student was issued an interim suspension for hosting a large party at his apartment on Friday.
Another student was issued an interim suspension for violation of a quarantine order on Saturday.
A student who posted a video on social media attempting to show people how to circumvent the Safer Illinois app is facing discipline.
The Pi Kappa Phi fraternity has been placed on interim suspension after another large party this weekend.
Approximately 100 additional students and organizations are facing disciplinary action for their behavior over the weekend.
These violations are unacceptable, and as we identify more individuals who are being irresponsible, they should be prepared to interrupt their studies and leave campus. Students who do not comply with campus COVID-19 rules or who fail to follow any instructions from Champaign-Urbana Public Health District will face immediate suspension. 
The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs has substantially increased staffing to monitor large gatherings, parties and other unacceptable activities in University Housing and throughout the Campustown area. In addition to possible city fines, party hosts will also be subject to immediate suspension. That office is also working in collaboration with CUPHD to more quickly identify and contact undergraduate students who have tested positive or been in close contact with those who have. Students who refuse to comply with quarantine or isolation directions will face immediate suspension. Student Affairs has established this confidential web form to allow you to report unsafe activities or behavior.  
What We Need You to Do to Help
If you receive a call from Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (beginning with a 217 or 312 area code), respond immediately and follow their guidance about quarantine and isolation. If you don’t, you will be in violation of state law, and you will be suspended from the university.
Limit your in-person activities only to essentials like twice weekly COVID-19 tests, attending class, purchasing groceries and food, going to work, engaging in individual outdoor activity, attending religious services and seeking medical attention.
Avoid traveling or attending large gatherings over the Labor Day weekend. Many of our positive cases these first two weeks were brought from communities without the level of testing we have.
Remember that in addition to university disciplinary action for violation of rules, you could also be subject to fines of up to $750 per day per violation of the COVID-19 related emergency orders from the cities of Urbana or Champaign.
If you see any non-compliance, please document the evidence and submit it through this web form. You can do so confidentially. If you see something, please let us know about it.
Please Follow the Rules
We are continually monitoring our total number of COVID-19 cases and positivity rates, and each act of non-compliance affects the trajectory of the Fall 2020 semester.
We have created the most extensive testing process of any university in the country. We have extensively modeled to make the best science-driven decisions. We have invented a new COVID-19 test. We’ve created a new app to ensure building access and academic standing are linked to testing compliance. Seven teams have worked since the spring to do everything we could possibly think of to make your Illinois experience as normal as possible.
We’ve given ourselves a real chance to come together and to stay together.
But the decision to do so is in your hands.
We stay together. Or we go home.
It comes down to these next two weeks.
It is up to you.

These include things like taking twice weekly COVID-19 tests, attending class, purchasing groceries and food, going to work, engaging in individual outdoor activity, attending religious services and seeking medical attention.
We have seen the majority of our students respond voluntarily and positively this semester and we expect these temporary restrictions to be adopted. Fortunately, our Shield testing program identified this trend early, and there is no evidence of any spread from students to instructors or to the broader local community.
The full massmail we will send to undergraduate students in a few minutes is included below with details about what we expect them to do and more information about our increased focus on compliance and enforcement.
These actions will repair much of the damage a few irresponsible students have caused, and this should flatten the curve.
But, if this approach does not successfully reverse this upward trend, we will move quickly and decisively to transition the rest of the semester to fully remote instruction.
The choices of our students in the next two weeks will determine the rest of our semester.
Sincerely

                September 11, 2020 3:01 PM

        Effective September 15, 2020, as part of our commitment to NAGPRA and to the concerns of Tribal Nations, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will implement a moratorium on research, teaching, display, imaging, and circulation of human remains and cultural items that are potentially subject to NAGPRA at the University, including all on-site collections in the University's custody or collections that the University has loaned to other organizations.
Dear Colleagues:
As a federally funded land-grant institution, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has an ethical and legal responsibility to acknowledge the Tribal Nations on whose land we reside and to curate and repatriate Native American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian human remains and funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony (collectively, “cultural items”) in a respectful, dignified, and legally compliant manner. The University is consulting with Tribal Nations regarding human remains and cultural items in University collections, in accordance with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. § 3001 et seq., 43 CFR Part 10; collectively, “NAGPRA”). Part of that effort involves establishing a moratorium on some activities: research, teaching, display, imaging, and circulation of human remains and cultural items that are potentially subject to NAGPRA at the University, including all on-site collections in the University's custody or collections that the University has loaned to other organizations.
The campus has established a NAGPRA Office within the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation to lead this work, with support from an Advisory Committee. The moratorium actively affirms the University’s commitment to respect the sovereignty of Tribal Nations in our research, teaching, and museum practices, and will remain in effect until the University’s NAGPRA Advisory Committee establishes procedures for review of access requests. The moratorium was developed in consultation with the Office of the Provost and the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion.  
The NAGPRA Office is responsible for the University’s inventory, documentation, consultation, and repatriation efforts under NAGPRA. Its work to fulfill the University's legal obligations is exempted from this moratorium. Certain projects, particularly those that have received explicit tribal permissions, may be eligible for interim review by the NAGPRA Advisory Committee. Their recommendations will be considered for approval by the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation, in consultation with the NAGPRA Officer.
For more specific information regarding the moratorium and interim review process, please visit the University’s NAGPRA web page and contact the NAGPRA Program Officer (nagpra@illinois.edu) with further questions.
Sincerely, 
Robert J. Jones

                September 1, 2020 4:09 PM

        Dear campus community member:
We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes on or immediately adjacent to campus property.
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes.
The University of Illinois Police Department was informed by a Campus Security Authority that a student was sexually assaulted at 12:20 a.m. on Monday, Aug. 31, at a fraternity house by a person known to the victim.
In instances of sexual offenses, we generally do not include specific details about exact locations or times to avoid releasing information that could lead to the identification of a survivor, unless that information is of vital importance to the safety of the campus community. We do this to reduce the possibility that a survivor becomes the target of retaliation, harassment or further psychological harm.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to assist the person involved in this incident and will continue to take actions to maintain the safety and security of the campus community.
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.
If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another person, intervene if it’s safe to do so or call for assistance.
While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. The university, community organizations and local law enforcement offer a number of reporting options.
Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.
It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
Congratulations on your efforts this week. I hope you enter this weekend with a sense of pride that is tempered by the honest recognition that we cannot celebrate or let up now.
Thank you for wearing your face coverings, for practicing social distancing, for getting your COVID-19 tests and for responding quickly if you learned of a positive test or were contacted by our public health officials.
Thank you for showing patience and kindness as you waited to get tested or to enter your building or classroom as we continue to learn and adjust.
And thank you to the staff of our testing sites and analytical laboratory who are now processing as many as 2.7% of all the COVID-19 tests in this country on a given day. You can find campus testing data here. 
As our models predicted, these first days saw our overall positivity rate remain well below that of the rest of the state even as positive tests were returned. This rapid testing, combined with the contact tracing efforts of the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District, has let us quickly help those who tested positive or have possibly been exposed to the virus find quarantine space to limit the spread.
Our rapid, comprehensive and uniquely Illinois saliva-based test and data models can give us the chance to do what so many other institutions have decided they cannot.
But it is the choices you have made and the judgement you have displayed in these first critical days that are allowing us to stay together.
As the leader of one of the few major universities in the country offering some in-person instruction, I do not exaggerate when I tell you the world is watching us. And with each day, more eyes are on us and more people are asking “Can Illinois really do this?”
Make no mistake. They are not watching because they want to see us fail.
They are watching because with each day you are giving everyone a growing sense of hope. They are holding a collective breath, and they want us to succeed.
This week you have given them every reason to put their faith in the students, faculty and staff of Illinois.
Thank you. And please, do not let up now.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                August 27, 2020 4:01 PM

        Faculty, Staff and Students,
We are nearing the end of our first week of on-campus COVID-19 saliva testing, and we have received feedback about the process and ways it could be improved. Please know that we are listening to your feedback, and we appreciate your patience and understanding as we navigate a complicated process that has never been done.
Based on your feedback, we are implementing the following changes to the current process:
For everyone who must participate in the on-campus testing program, you must be tested and receive negative results at least every four days. 
You will be in compliance and have Access Granted status for building entry from the time you receive your negative test results until 11:59 on the fourth day after you take the test. 
For example, if you test Monday, you will receive Access Granted status (in both the Safer Illinois app and the Boarding Pass options) from the time you receive a negative result until 11:59 p.m. on Friday of the same week.

We are continuing to encourage everyone to use these two-day testing schedules to make it an easy part of a weekly routine:
Monday and Thursday
Tuesday and Friday
Wednesday and Saturday
Wednesday and Sunday

If you are a student, we highly encourage you to choose one of the weekend schedules (Wednesday and Saturday or Wednesday and Sunday) to take advantage of shorter lines when the university is less populated. We are increasing capacity at testing sites for the weekends for your convenience.
We are stopping all reminder emails immediately. The intention was to give more guidance, but we understand they have unintentionally led to more confusion. 
If you already have a two-day testing schedule that works for you, please continue to use it.
If you have requested a different testing schedule than the one you originally received, please feel free to begin using it now.
If you have not been assigned a testing schedule, please pick one of the two-day testing schedules above that works for you.
Please understand that test results may require up to 48 hours.
One important note about Labor Day: You will need to test on Thursday, Friday, Saturday or Sunday to ensure compliance when regular operations resume Tuesday. Some testing sites will be open on Labor Day as well.
We are also working on a tool to check which times and locations at each testing location are least busy, so you can make the best decision about where and when to test. We will provide more information just as soon as we are able.
Please continue to check the On-Campus Testing COVID-19 Testing page on the university’s COVID-19 website as we continue to add to the FAQ section. Thank you for your diligence and continued patience as we navigate this together. If you have additional questions about this process or testing schedules, please email covid-19@illinois.edu. If you have questions about testing results or quarantine or isolation, please email covidwellness@illinois.edu.

The Urbana campus will test its emergency notification system at 10:05 a.m. on Tuesday, Sept. 1.
All campus community members are encouraged to sign up for Illini-Alert text messages to receive prompt notification of campus emergencies. You can do so by visiting http://emergency.illinois.edu. Contact information for friends and relatives may be added at http://go.illinois.edu/illinialertmyfamily. Anyone else can sign up by texting ""IlliniAlert"" to 226787.
The test of the Illini-Alert system will use all of the communication capabilities of the emergency notification system:
Email messages will be sent to all active faculty and staff members and students with campus email addresses.
Text messages will be sent to those people who have registered their cellphone numbers.  
The Emergency Web Alert System will trigger a pop-up box on all campus websites.
A message will appear on the Illini-Alert Facebook account (http://www.facebook.com/illinialert).
A message will be sent to the Illini-Alert Twitter account (http://twitter.com/illinialert).
A message will appear on all digital signs connected to the Illini-Alert system.
The test does not require any response; evaluators will be able to monitor the speed and distribution rates of the messaging. Thank you for your cooperation.

        Dear Students,
As you know by now, when we start the semester on Monday, we will be one of an increasingly small number of universities to be doing so with any significant amount of in-person instruction. At the end of this message you'll find a final list of some important actions and preparations you’ll need to be sure you’ve completed.
Our ability to come together this way is built on the foundation of our innovative on-campus COVID-19 saliva-based testing program. What will determine if we stay together in-person through the semester is whether we all can make the right personal choices and exercise the very best judgement in these critical first few weeks of the semester.
Our testing can quickly detect the virus. This comprehensive testing allows for quick quarantine, public health contact tracing and rapid delivery of any necessary medical care. But the only way we can prevent it from spreading in the first place is by wearing face coverings, washing our hands, practicing social distancing and avoiding crowds and situations that we know put many people at risk of exposure and put all of us at risk of having to return to fully remote operations as we did in the spring.
If we ALL commit to this very hard work, our chances of remaining together throughout the semester get better. In the last week alone, we’ve seen several institutions revert quickly away from on-campus operations. Although we believe our testing capability better positions us, we know how quickly things can change.
We have invented a new kind of test, we’ve launched what is to our knowledge the most comprehensive COVID-19 testing program in the country, we’ve built the Safer Illinois app specifically for this cause and we’ve reimagined and redesigned almost every course, classroom and meeting space.
In short, we’ve given ourselves the chance to succeed at something that has never been attempted before.
We’ve got an opportunity many others in the country do not. It is up to all of us – together – to make it a reality.
These next two or three weeks will define how we move forward from here.
We have said this before and we say it again now.
We believe in you. We believe in your strength of character, your values and in your commitment to the community that surrounds us.
And we believe the choices you make in these next days will show the world what is possible when Illinois students come together when it matters most.

Important Information and Final Preparations for Monday
Make sure you have completed your required on-campus COVID-19 test and have your results in time before you try to attend an in-person class or enter any university building.
You can find a list of testing sites and hours here. Several are open Saturday and Sunday.
Please refrain from eating, drinking, tooth brushing, mouth washing, gum chewing and tobacco use for one hour before your test.
You will not be able to access classrooms or university buildings this semester if you are not completing two tests each week, and you could face action through the student discipline process. If you have not received information about a testing schedule yet, you should plan to test every four days.

Make sure you are ready to show your building entry status. You’ll need to make sure you’ve got a current version of the Safer Illinois app or bookmark the COVID-19 Boarding Pass page on your phone. The COVID-19 Boarding Pass will not be active for use until Monday, Aug. 24.
Make sure your technology and Internet access are going to meet your needs this fall. This Technology Services guide is a great place to start. Whether you are studying remotely or coming to campus, if you do not have access to a functional computer or reliable Internet connectivity in your location, please contact the Student Assistance Center at 217-333-0050 or helpdean@illinois.edu.
Update your fall address information in Self-Service. You are required to do this no matter where you will be studying this semester. Instructions are here if you need them.
Pick up your PPE kit at the Illini Union in the I-Rooms if you haven’t done so already.
Complete your required Division of Research Safety COVID-19 online training.
Join the thousands who have taken the Illinois Community Pledge.
Make sure you are aware of the special new COVID-19 ordinances and rules Champaign and Urbana have put in place. These include limits on gathering sizes, requires all campus area bars and restaurants to serve customers in outdoor areas only through Labor Day (9/7), prohibits anyone under 21 from entering bars after 9 p.m. and public face-covering requirements. You can find the Champaign Emergency Orders here."

                August 21, 2020 10:17 AM

        “What makes you think you can open the semester with in-person classes?”
That is the question we are all hearing this week as we see a number of other universities change course to move fully online.
It’s because we have our innovative new saliva-based test and the infrastructure to deploy that testing with the frequency and scale that we have put in place. This comprehensive testing allows for quick quarantine, public health contact tracing and rapid delivery of any necessary medical care.
This makes all of the difference – for our university and for the members of the community in which we all live, work and learn.
On Monday, we conducted about 10,000 tests. To put that in a national context, about 1.3 percent of all COVID-19 tests performed in the nation on that day were processed right here on campus.  
As our testing has accelerated this week, we have seen an increase in daily positive cases that is well within the expectations of our state and local public health officials and local hospitals. But the more important number to watch is our very low daily positivity rate. This is the percentage of people who test positive out of those who have been tested. This is a critical measure because it tells us how widespread the infection is here in our community and whether our levels of testing are keeping up with levels of disease transmission.
We have conducted more than 60,000 tests since we began the program in July. During this time we watched our daily positivity rate drop from about 1.5% to below 0.2%. The positivity rate this week has ranged between 0.3 and 0.5 percent. These rates are several times lower than the corresponding positivity rate for our Restore Illinois region and ten times below the maximum levels that the World Health Organization recommends. Starting next week, our daily test results will be posted on the COVID-19 website.
Data models developed by our faculty this summer predicted a few hundred new cases as people return to campus over the first few weeks of the semester with cases dropping off after that and a low daily positivity rate throughout. The actual results of this first week are very, very close to these predictions. We have been sharing these models with state and local health officials, our local city leaders and our community hospitals who have used the data in their own planning and preparations for these first weeks of the semester.
However, those same models very clearly show that our collective actions during these first two weeks will determine what the rest of our semester will look like. Testing alone will not contain the spread of the virus.
What will determine if we stay together in-person is whether we all can make the personal choices and exercise the very best judgement in these critical early days. Our testing can detect the virus quickly. But the only way we can prevent it from spreading in the first place is by wearing face coverings, washing our hands, practicing social distancing and avoiding crowds and situations that we know put many people at risk of exposure and put all of us at risk of having to return to fully remote operations as we did in the spring.
These next 10 or 15 days will define how we move forward from here.
It is our innovative spirit and the creativity of our own researchers that have given us this test that gives us a chance to overcome the challenges that have forced many other universities to move fully online.
But, in the end, it is the commitment and character of our students, faculty and staff to take hard, but necessary actions, and to exercise discipline and good judgement that will carry us forward.
We can do this. But we must do it together.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                August 20, 2020 10:32 PM

        Dear Students,
The cities of Champaign and Urbana recently issued emergency orders regarding the use of face coverings, parties, and social gatherings.
The new Emergency Orders were put into place to continue to promote community health and safety amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
The Emergency Orders, effective immediately, require:
Individuals over the age of two and able to medically tolerate a face mask, to cover their nose and mouth with a face covering when in public and unable to maintain at least a six-foot social distance from others.
This applies to indoor spaces, like retail stores, and outdoor spaces when an individual cannot maintain a minimum six-foot distance from others.

Social distancing requirements on properties in the Campus Area (including apartments, houses, and adjacent property like yards, parking lots, and common areas) and multifamily residential structures throughout Champaign and Urbana (including residential units, common areas, yards, and parking lots).
View Campus Area maps for the City of Champaign and City of Urbana.
In both the Campus Area and multifamily residential structures in the Champaign-Urbana community, individuals at parties or gatherings must abide by social distancing requirements, including the use of face coverings and limit parties and gatherings to a maximum of ten people (plus the host and the host’s immediate family or others legally permitted to reside in the property).

Party hosts and attendees violating an Emergency Order may be cited for a City Ordinance violation and fined up to $750 per violation day. These Orders also apply to parties or gatherings on public property, unless otherwise permitted by other emergency or executive orders or the law.
Hosts should be prepared to prove legal possession, whether by reason of ownership or lease, over the premises where a Party or Gathering occurs. A copy of your lease or house and corps roster will satisfy this requirement.

Patrons of Urbana bars or restaurants must be seated, wear masks when they aren’t eating or drinking, and maintain social distancing of at least a six (6) feet that separates two or more individuals from each other.
Patrons under the age of 21 are prohibited from being inside Urbana bars after 9 p.m.
In an effort to comply with these Emergency Orders, the Illini Union has removed all seating from the lower level and will direct patrons to eat outside of the building. In addition, seating in the courtyard will be reserved for studying only until further notice.
It is suggested that whenever possible, people choose an outdoor location to partake of food and drink.
To read the full text of the Emergency Orders, please visit the City of Champaign champaignil.gov/covid-19 and City of Urbana urbanaillinois.us/COVID-19 websites.
If you have questions regarding the City of Champaign’s Emergency Orders, please contact the City of Champaign City Manager's Office at 403-8710 or email citymanagersoffice@champaignil.gov. For questions regarding the City of Urbana Emergency Orders, please visit urbanaillinois.us/citizens-voice.

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
As we begin this Fall 2020 semester, we want to remind you to participate in our COVID-19 on-campus testing program as soon as you arrive on campus or in Champaign County. If you are currently living here, we hope you will begin now. 
We have been working closely with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District since this pandemic began, and we have plans and processes in place to maximize the safety of everyone as we navigate the positive cases that we anticipate as we repopulate campus. I am writing this message to explain our process for what happens if you ever receive a positive COVID-19 test result, so you will have a clear understanding of the support available to you.
Student process for positive COVID-19 case
Students will be notified of results from an on-campus test via email through the McKinley Patient Health Portal. It is critically important that you check your university email account daily and access your results in the McKinley Patient Health Portal upon receiving notification of test result availability. (Safer Illinois app users can also see results through the app.)
You will be contacted within 24 hours by the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (using phone number 312-777-1999) to provide specific isolation guidance and to collect information for contact tracing. I encourage you to add this number in your phone as a contact.
If you test positive, please go to your local place of residence (residence hall room, apartment, etc.) and self-isolate, limiting your contact with others immediately. When CUPHD contacts you, they will coordinate with you and university staff to find a place where you will isolate. If you would like to go to your permanent residence to isolate, you will work with CUPHD to determine whether it is safe for you to do so.
Isolation as directed by CUPHD is mandatory for students. If you choose not to follow this guidance, you could be subject to student discipline.
You should not leave your residence/isolation location after receiving a positive test result until you are notified you can do so by CUPHD.
If you receive a positive test, you will need to email your instructors and let them know you will be absent from class. You do not need to share any specific health information with them.
If you are in remote courses, you may continue to attend class online if you are able.
You can use the OSF On Call program that provides information, support and guidance at no cost to you.
The Student Assistance Center (217-333-0050; helpdean@illinois.edu) is also available to help you understand university policies and procedures and connect you with resources, whether related to COVID-19 or other challenges that you may be experiencing.
Employee process for positive COVID-19 case
Employees will be notified of results from an on-campus test via email through the McKinley Patient Health Portal. It is critically important that you check your university email account daily and access your results in the McKinley Patient Health Portal upon receiving notification of test result availability. (Safer Illinois app users can also see results through the app.)
If you test positive, you should avoid contact with others immediately. You will be contacted within 24 hours by the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (using phone number 312-777-1999) to provide specific isolation guidance and to collect information for contact tracing. I encourage you to add this number in your phone as a contact.
Isolation as directed by CUPHD is mandatory for employees. If you choose not to follow this guidance, you could be subject to discipline through Illinois Human Resources.
If you test positive, you will be provided information about where to isolate.
You should not leave your home/isolation location after receiving a positive test result until you are cleared by CUPHD.
Employees who receive a positive test are required to notify Illinois Human Resources by calling 217-300-9005. Illinois Human Resources will provide information about paid leave options, as well as collect information that will help ensure we take any necessary cleaning or sanitation steps.
You must inform your unit of your absence, but you do not need to share specific health information. IHR will only provide information necessary to take any appropriate safety actions.
If you are doing remote work, you may continue to work if you are able.
You can use the OSF On Call program that provides information, support and guidance at no cost to you.
Quarantine & stay-at-home requirements for students and employees
Quarantine helps prevent the spread of disease by separating and restricting the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease. Quarantine is used to keep someone who might have been exposed to COVID-19 away from others to reduce the potential risk of transmission. Quarantine is different than isolation, which is used when someone has tested positive for COVID-19.
As this time, these are the scenarios in which quarantine will be required:
If you have been identified by CUPHD as someone who has been exposed to a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, you will receive a call from CUPHD (using phone number 312-777-1999). This process is known as contact tracing. You will then be required to quarantine as instructed by CUPHD.
If you receive an exposure notification through the Safer Illinois app, you should quarantine and get a COVID-19 test on the fourth day after the exposure. Read more about exposure notifications on the Safer Illinois website.
New travel guidance has been issued from the Centers for Disease Control, Illinois Department of Public Health and the Champaign Urbana Public Health District recommending a 14-day stay at home order that is similar to, but not quite as restrictive as quarantine. This post-travel stay at home requirement applies to travel to areas of higher risk, both international and U.S. hot spots.
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has one of the most innovative on-campus COVID-19 testing programs in the country. We have worked with local public health officials and medical providers to ensure that any predicted increase in positive results that comes with this unmatched level of testing and notification will be within the Restore Illinois guidelines while maximizing the health of all members of our community.
This testing program gives us a unique safeguard to undertake the hybrid education model we begin next week. Combined with all of the safety measures recommended by public health officials, we have a system of protocols and tools that is not available to any other university in the country at this time. We have the opportunity to come together this fall in ways that others do not. But it will require all of us taking these actions and following the testing and response processes we have established to safely stay together for the semester.

                August 18, 2020 2:02 PM

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
As you prepare for the first day of instruction, I’m writing to share some important information that you need to know about entering buildings for the Fall 2020 semester. In order to maximize the safety of our entire community, we will be limiting access to facilities to individuals who are in compliance with safety requirements. This is an important step of our safety planning, and I want to be sure you know what to expect before the first week of classes.
Buildings with in-person classes
The university plans to place a specially trained employee called a Wellness Support Associate (WSA) inside one or two entrances to many facilities where in-person classes are being held. In those facilities, all other doors and entrances will be locked.
At each WSA-staffed entrance, any individual (faculty, staff or students) who wishes to enter must show WSAs their building entry status. This status shows that an individual is up-to-date for on-campus testing, does not have a positive COVID-19 test and has not been instructed by the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District to quarantine or isolate for any reason.
Individuals can view their status and display it to WSAs by choosing one of the following options:
Safer Illinois app
COVID-19 Boarding Pass (this can be used by showing a webpage or printing a physical pass)
Please note that the Access Granted/Access Denied mechanisms will not be active for use until Aug. 21, and in-person checks for building status will not begin until Aug. 24. Beginning on Monday, individuals should wait their turn to display their Access Granted status to the WSA in a line. Everyone should plan to arrive early, wear a face covering and practice social distancing (at least six feet away from the person in front of and behind you) in order to ensure a smooth process.
All students, faculty and staff start with their building access status set to Access Denied. This will be the case whether you choose to use the app or a boarding pass option. In order to initially have your status changed to Access Granted, you must have a negative COVID-19 test.
I encourage everyone to begin on-campus testing as soon as they return to the campus community, at least two days before you expect to enter an on-campus facility. Individuals must continue to participate in the on-campus testing program to retain Access Granted status. Click here for more information about the COVID-19 testing program.
Other facilities
Other university facilities may also check building entry status for individuals who plan to work on-campus. There may also be different mechanisms to check for building entry status in place at non-instructional facilities. Students will receive more information about building entrance status as it relates to residence halls, dining halls and other student services. Units in non-instructional buildings should clearly communicate to their employees about the building access protocols they will use. 
You can find more information about building access, including a list of FAQs, on the university’s COVID-19 website. The website is updated frequently, and I encourage you to review it often in the coming weeks.
Thank you for your patience as we figure out how to resolve the operational challenges of a COVID-19 semester together. I sincerely appreciate your understanding as we continue to make decisions and take actions to maximize the safety of our students, faculty, staff and the community in which we live and work.
I know every answer we provide seems to lead to another question. And, all-too-often, the answers will change as new information becomes available. This is one of the greatest frustrations of this pandemic. We’ll continue to tell you what we know as soon as we can.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

          Dear colleagues:
I am delighted to announce the second cohort for the system-wide Public Voices Fellowship. The national Public Voices Fellowship is a unique opportunity led by The OpEd Project and designed for tenure-system faculty. The program is part of a national initiative to help faculty amplify their expertise in ways that can contribute to public conversations about pressing issues. The 20 faculty in this second cohort will attend four sessions held during the 2020-21 academic year and will be paired with a journalism mentor that provides one-on-one editing and coaching, with the goal of publishing two op-ed pieces during the program.
We received more than 40 nominations from across our three universities for the program and the selection process was very competitive. Diversity of background and experiences as well as university representation were factors in the selection process.

                August 12, 2020 3:09 PM

        To Members of the Campus Community,
All on-campus COVID-19 testing sites will be closed on Thursday, Aug. 13 and Friday, Aug. 14 to add some essential new equipment and complete the training of new staff that have joined our team.
These are part of our final preparations to scale up our testing operations to accommodate full implementation of twice-weekly testing of all students, faculty and staff. This equipment and personnel will offer greater redundancy, reliability and help ensure test results will be processed and posted as quickly as possible as we open the semester.
Due to the closures, the faculty and staff testing requirement will be waived this week. However, if you were planning on testing Thursday or Friday and want to complete a test this week, you can visit one of the sites that will be open this weekend.
The sites at Washington Park, NCSA and in Illini Union 314 will be open Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. – 3 p.m. You can find more detailed information about where to find these sites and maps here. All testing sites will be reopen for their regular hours on Monday, Aug. 17.
Thank you to those who have already begun testing regularly. Your participation has helped us to scale up our process very quickly since it launched in July. And, of course, the rapid results of this Illinois test have given all of us on campus another tool to monitor our own health and provided our public health officials important information about the overall health of our local community.

                August 12, 2020 1:02 PM

        Dear Students,
We are now within two weeks of the opening of the semester. It is going to be very different until the pandemic is past us, so we are asking you to add a few very important COVID-19-related items to your list of final preparations in these coming days. There are a number of new requirements and expectations in place and we want you to understand them and be ready to begin your year as smoothly as possible under these very, very unusual circumstances.
For All Students
Whether you will be physically coming to campus or you will be studying remotely, here are some things we ask you to do as soon as possible.
Update your fall address information in Self-Service by Aug. 17. You are required to do this no matter where you will be studying this semester. Instructions are here if you need them.
Complete your required Division of Research Safety COVID-19 online training by Aug. 24.
Check your fall schedule again in Course Explorer to make sure there are no changes or conflicts.
Make sure your technology and Internet access are going to meet your needs this fall. This Technology Services guide is a great place to start.
Whether you are studying remotely or coming to campus, if you do not have access to a functional computer or reliable Internet connectivity in your location, please contact the Student Assistance Center at 217-333-0050 or helpdean@illinois.edu. The Center can work with you to make sure you have access to the technology you need.
Check your university email account often. Things can change quickly these days and your university email address is the fastest way we have to reach you. And remember, you can always find the latest updates related to the pandemic at covid19.illinois.edu.
Help your family stay informed as well by signing them up for parent and family communications at go.illinois.edu/connectme.
For Students Coming to Campus and into our Local Community
For those of you who will be joining the Urbana-Champaign community this semester, we ask you to take some additional steps before you leave home and when you arrive here.
As soon as you physically arrive, you must begin taking your free, required campus COVID-19 tests twice a week. Whether you are living in University Housing or a private residence, you should start testing the day you arrive here.
Testing sites are open now, and as soon as you have your i-card, you can begin testing. Just make sure you refrain from eating, drinking, tooth brushing, mouth washing, gum chewing and tobacco use for 30 minutes before your test. See the available testing locations here.
You will not be able to access classrooms or university buildings this semester if you are not completing two tests each week, and you could face action through the student discipline process.  
Watch for information this week about downloading the Safer Illinois app. This app will display your building entry status and allow easier access to testing results. 

In the days before you leave home, take extra precautions to minimize your possible exposure to the virus and to reduce the risk of the spread of the virus to friends, classmates, professors, staff and members of our community.
If you are not feeling well, please stay home and quarantine yourself. If you believe that delaying your return for this reason will cause problems with your classes or housing or registration, please contact the Student Assistance Center (217-333-0050, helpdean@illinois.edu). We’ll work with you to figure it all out. Making sure you are safe and healthy is our first priority.
Practice social distancing all of the time – in public and in private.
Wear your mask or face covering if you cannot keep a safe distance from others.
Avoid large public gatherings, social events and crowded spaces such as bars and restaurants.
If COVID-19 testing is available to you where you live, you should consider getting tested shortly before you come to campus so you can be sure that you are COVID-19 negative before you decide to travel. This is not required, but if it is an option available to you, it is another safeguard you can take.

However you will be participating this semester – in-person or remotely – we know COVID-19 is going to bring with it additional challenges.
Face coverings, twice weekly COVID-19 tests, many more online classes and staying six feet away from your friends and classmates – these things are not typical at Illinois and we know how much we are asking of you. But these are the things we must do in order to look after one another’s well-being as we come together this semester. And if we ALL commit to this very hard work, our chances of remaining together throughout the semester get better.
We believe in you. We believe in your strength of character, your values and in your commitment to the community. And we know you will do your part to help us make sure we navigate the uncertainty and manage the challenges of this pandemic.
Thank you for taking care of one another this semester.

                August 11, 2020 3:02 PM

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff, 
Last Monday’s massmail about Fall 2020 requirements answered many questions about the fall semester. One of the most significant requirements during this semester will be twice-weekly COVID-19 tests for all students on or near campus, and for all staff and faculty who have a need to be on-campus for any reason and for any length of time. To the best of our knowledge, the ability to offer this level of access to free, rapid COVID-19 tests is unmatched in the country right now. It is a critical component in our ability to resume our modified in-person instruction.
Faculty and staff were required to begin their regular testing on Monday, Aug. 10 or as soon as they arrive on campus after that date. Students will be required to begin testing on Sunday, Aug. 16 or as soon as they arrive on campus after that date.
The SHIELD: Target, Test, Tell team has determined that, in order to reduce the chance of exposure during this initial period when a larger volume of people are returning to campus at once, students, faculty and staff are required to have completed a test and received a negative result before being allowed to access university classrooms, buildings and facilities.
Testing sites are now open. If you have a valid i-card, we encourage you to start taking advantage of the availability of this free, rapid testing right now. We want you to start testing as soon as you are on campus or back in our local community. Just make sure you refrain from eating, drinking, tooth brushing, mouth washing, gum chewing and tobacco use for 30 minutes before your test. See the available testing locations here.
We know this testing requirement brings with it another set of questions for our university community. We want to give you answers to some of the most frequent ones we are hearing.
How will my weekly testing schedule be determined and when will I get it?In the next few days, you will receive an email invitation with a link to complete an individualized, confidential survey that will help determine the two days that best match your weekly schedule and routine. The message will have the subject line “Your COVID-19 Survey and Testing Schedule,” and it will be sent from covidwellness@illinois.edu.The SHIELD team will use your answers to determine the test days that best match your needs and that give you the most current results when your potential exposure to the virus is highest. You should expect to receive a separate email with your testing schedule before the semester begins.A new survey will be sent to everyone the first week of every month, allowing your schedule to change as you adjust your activities throughout the semester.When you receive the survey, you will also be asked if you will share your answers with a group of researchers working with the SHIELD: Target, Test, Tell team. Sharing your information confidentially will assist our study on COVID-19 risk, spread and management. If you do not wish to consent to participate in the research component, your survey response will be used only to set your testing schedule.
What if I don’t complete the survey?Your weekly testing schedule will be assigned randomly. The survey is the best way to make sure your testing schedule is built around your daily life and campus engagement and activities.
I don’t have my scheduled days yet. When should I go test?Until you have received your individualized testing schedule, you can test twice a week on one of the following combination of days: Monday/Thursday, Tuesday/Friday, Wednesday/Saturday, Thursday/Sunday. The goal is to test at least every four days.
What if I can’t go on my scheduled day for some reason?You must do your best to keep to your schedule. This offers all of us the greatest level of protection and the most accurate data to monitor and slow any spread of the virus in our community.
Will I have to go to a specific site or have an appointment?You can take your test at any site you choose at any time during normal operating hours on your scheduled testing days. You will receive emailed reminders on days when you are scheduled.
What happens if I miss one of my scheduled testing days?You will receive an initial email reminder that you have missed a scheduled test. Your access to campus classrooms, buildings or facilities may be removed. You must visit one of our testing sites, and you must resume your assigned testing schedule at the first opportunity, even if this means you take a test on consecutive days. Failure to complete your required testing could also result in action through the applicable student or employee discipline process.
Can I still come on campus if I’ve missed one of my scheduled tests?Your access to campus classrooms, buildings or facilities may be removed. You must visit one of our testing sites, and you must resume your assigned testing schedule at the first opportunity, even if this means you then must take a test on consecutive days.  
How do I restore my access to enter university facilities and buildings if I have missed my test?If you have had your access restricted because you have missed a test, during the first few weeks of the semester, you will need to get a COVID-19 test as soon as possible. With a negative test result, your access will be restored. Depending upon how soon you get tested, it could take up to 48 hours for access to be restored.
I live in University Housing. Will I be able to enter my residence hall if I miss one of my tests?Yes. But that is the only building you will be able to enter until you have checked in at a testing site and until you have received a negative test result. If you have a current University Housing contract, you will always be able to enter your residence hall.
What if I miss class because I missed my scheduled test date?This would be considered an absence and our regular academic policies and practices would apply. Your course syllabus will explain how absences are addressed. In addition to the possible academic penalties, failure to complete your required testing could also result in action through the student discipline process.  
I am living on campus or in the local community, but all my classes are online. Do I still have to get tested twice a week?Yes. If you are living on-campus or in the community you will need to test twice a week to remain in good academic standing, even if you are taking a fully online schedule. If you live here you must test. If you come to campus for any reason, you must test.  
Can I get my weekly scheduled days changed? If you have questions about your testing schedule or about any of the testing process, please email our COVID Wellness Answer Center at covidwellness@illinois.edu. You should also contact the COVID Wellness Answer Center if you do not receive your survey invitation by Aug. 12.
The Illinois test for COVID-19 is unique, and it is foundational to our efforts to resume in-person instruction and on-campus operations this year. And while the process is quick and easy with conveniently located testing sites, we know there is nothing normal about asking you to test twice a week. But until the pandemic is behind us, physically coming together and remaining together will require each of us to take new and unfamiliar actions.
When all of us commit to wearing face coverings, washing our hands often, practicing social distancing and getting tested regularly, we aren’t just protecting ourselves, we are looking out for our friends, our coworkers and the members of the community in which we all live.
Please watch for your survey invitation next week and thank you for making your COVID-19 test part of your weekly routine.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                August 4, 2020 8:16 AM

        Dear Students,
All students enrolled for the Fall 2020 semester are required to provide their fall address information by August 17. Maintaining an updated address enables campus health and wellness units to communicate proper protocols to students that will help us all maintain a safe and healthy campus environment during the pandemic. This requirement, along with a number of others, was shared in this massmail on Monday, Aug. 3.
ACTION: To input this information in Self-Service:
In Self-Service, select “University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.”
Log in using your NetID and Password.
In the Main Menu, select “Personal Information.”
In the Personal Information menu, select “Addresses & Phones.”
In the dropdown for “Type of Address to Insert,” select “Student Location” then click “Submit.”
Use August 1, 2020 as the “Valid From This Date,” and December 31, 2020 for the “Until This Date” field.
Complete the Address Lines 1-3 to the best of your ability. Address Line 1 is a required field that should include your location street name and number. If you don’t know a specific apartment number, for example, you can leave Address Lines 2 and/or 3 blank.
Input the City of your location and select the appropriate State or Province from the drop-down. The ZIP or Postal Code and County fields will populate automatically based on City and State or Province. If your location is international, not in the U.S. or Canada, you can enter your nation first, then please provide a complete postal address including street, city and postal code where applicable.
Once you have completed the remaining fields to the best of your ability (phone information is not required), click “Submit.”
You can then exit Self-Service by clicking “EXIT” in the upper-right corner.
BACKGROUND:  All students must access Self-Service to input this information no later than August 17 at 11:59 p.m. CDT. In order to ensure the health and safety of our campus, COVID-19 testing and participation in contact tracing is mandatory for all local students. Having accurate information to know who is in the local community is thus essential. Release of student information is restricted based on the criteria of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974.
This action is required of all students who are enrolled for the Fall 2020 semester; it is separate from any previously entered address data. Failure to take action by the deadline or inputting false or intentionally inaccurate information will result in referral to the Office of Student Conflict Resolution for disciplinary or other corrective action. Since students who are on campus need to be able to utilize important health and wellness units, all students with a local fall address will be assessed the Health Service Fee and will have access to McKinley Health Center and the Counseling Center. Students for whom the minimum required information is missing or incomplete will be considered to be local.
Questions regarding the entry process should be directed to Registration Services. If you have questions about the use of this information, please contact the Provost’s office.
We appreciate your prompt attention to this important matter.

        Dear students,
I am writing to announce some important decisions about requirements and expectations for the Fall 2020 semester. We realize people have been waiting patiently, asking important questions and not always receiving detailed answers when you hoped to have them. We hope you find a lot of those answers in this message. We still don’t have them all, but we’re going to continue to tell you what we know as quickly and openly as we can. Continue to check the university COVID-19 website for the most recent details.
We are a university that is privileged to be home to some of the world’s leading minds on COVID-19 safety, testing and procedures. If we all do our part, we believe we have the ability to achieve our missions. Below is a summary of some critical information you will need to know in the coming weeks.
Updated Fall 2020 Requirements & Protocols 
COVID-19 Testing – On-campus testing is required for all faculty, staff or students who have a need to be on-campus for any reason for any length of time.
Mandatory twice weekly testing will be required for all faculty, staff or students who participate in any on-campus activities.
Faculty, staff or students visiting the campus only occasionally (for example, picking up something from their office) will be required to go to a testing center, get tested and have test results dated no more than four days prior to entering any university facility.
Note: If you are currently participating in any on-campus work or activities, you are encouraged to begin this practice now. Please see more information about testing (including a list of the current on-campus testing sites) here.
Contact Tracing – We are coordinating and partnering closely with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District to support their work to manage contact tracing for all COVID-19 cases in Champaign County that are related to our faculty, staff or students.
Quarantine & Isolation – All faculty, staff or students who test positive for COVID-19 are required to isolate per guidance by the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. Quarantine requirements apply to those who travel internationally or are placed into quarantine by public health based on exposure to someone who tested positive. More information about quarantine requirements for individuals returning to campus can be found here.
Online COVID-19 Training – All faculty, staff and students, regardless of whether they are participating in on-campus activities or are 100 percent remote, are required to complete the Division of Research Safety COVID-19 online training. This must be completed before Monday, Aug. 24.
Face Coverings & Social Distancing – We will continue to require everyone to practice social distancing on campus and to wear face coverings in university facilities unless they are alone in a private space. Face coverings are also required for outside campus spaces where sufficient social distancing is not possible.
Fall 2020 Residence – All students will be required to provide their residential address for the Fall 2020 semester through Self-Service. This is to ensure that all individuals on or near campus are included in the mandatory COVID-19 testing program. More information will be provided in a subsequent email. 
Other Fall 2020 Guidance

        Dear Students,
Thanks to the hard work of units across campus and to your patience and cooperation, we are pleased to share that the Fall 2020 Class Schedule is now live in Course Explorer.
We encourage you to review your fall class schedule now and to continue to do so regularly, as minor modifications can be expected until the start of classes. When you check your updated fall schedule, you should expect to see that some of your courses have moved online or to hybrid delivery. You may also see some location changes for courses that will continue to meet in person. If you are comfortable with your schedule, there is no need to act. When considering changes, please be aware that access to in-person courses is limited. If you need to make changes, you may do so beginning with the date and time of your revised Fall 2020 Time Ticket. Information on the time ticket process, including approximate start dates assigned by group, can be found on the Office of the Registrar’s website.
Again, it is important to continue to check your schedule periodically throughout the month of August since minor modifications may still be made. Continue to carefully read any messages from your academic advisor, departmental, and/or college offices, and please connect with your advisor regarding any questions you have about your fall schedule.
Thanks again for your continued flexibility and understanding.
Sincerely,
Meghan HazenRegistrar"

                July 27, 2020 9:02 AM

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
Recent events have once again underscored the critical need for universities across our nation to prioritize research focused on systemic racial inequities that exist not only in our communities but in higher education itself. 
Systemic racism and generationally embedded racial disparity are two of the greatest challenges facing our society. It is time to focus the vast and unmatched intellectual and scholarly talent of this 21st century land-grant university on finding new solutions to these persistent and destructive issues. It is time for this university to issue this new and unequivocal Call to Action to address these embedded and persisting disparities at every level with our full and comprehensive, transdisciplinary excellence. And we must do so with the same urgency, creativity and purpose we have seen in response to the COVID-19 crisis.  
In the coming days and weeks, we will be introducing a series of actions, investments, programs and policy reform efforts designed to quickly and permanently transform the way our own university supports, prioritizes and recognizes the research of scholars working on issues of systemic racism in the United States.
Led by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, this Call to Action initiative will lay out a framework for how we make this transformation and establish a series of working groups charged with taking concrete steps forward to dismantle systemic racism and injustice that are both measurable and accountable by the end of the coming academic year.
In a recent essay relaying my perspectives on the devastating impacts of systemic racism I made the statement that we must be unapologetically impatient in seeking change. So I want to be clear that this is not another call to talk. It is very specifically a call to act in ways that will be comprehensive, measurable, strategic, thoughtful, transparent and rapid.
And the core of everything we do through this Call to Action this year will be built on the foundation of scholarly rigor and research prominence that are the Illinois hallmarks. There is a critical need for high quality, high integrity scholarship that provides foundations to intervene in institutionalized disparities, structures of violence, and over-criminalization to fundamentally address the root of issues that continue to create inequality, inequity and lost opportunities for too many in our society.
So, I am excited to announce that the inaugural component in the Call to Action is the Chancellor’s Research Program to Address Racism and Social Injustice.
Managed by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in collaboration with the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation, the new program will invest $2 million annually to support competitively awarded tenure/tenure-track faculty grants, an annual symposium of funded projects and an ongoing lecture series. The first call for research proposals and inaugural awards will be coming early in the fall semester.
The inaugural call for proposals will focus on these three areas:
Systemic racism and social justice
Law enforcement and criminal justice reform
Disparities in health and health care
This initiative is just the first step as we seek to transform the way our own university supports, prioritizes, and recognizes the research of scholars working on issues of systemic racism in the United States. There are many more to come in the days and weeks ahead.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Students,
The Massmail from June 23, 2020 detailed planned activities around fall schedule modifications and the updated registration process. Following this plan, the Office of the Registrar has reviewed and compiled departmental course revision submissions. Based on the compilation of these submissions:
The majority of revisions to classes involve delivery mode, primarily moving sections online along with some moves to hybrid (mix of in-person and online) delivery. You should expect your revised schedule to include at least some online courses.
The meeting location for in-person courses may have changed.
Although time conflicts are unlikely, you should still review meeting dates and times carefully.
Time tickets were issued July 14. Your time ticket represents the earliest date and time at which you can revise your fall class schedule if you wish in Self-Service. Course Explorer will return to live mode July 31. Please note the information provided on the Registrar’s site about how to recognize if a class is online.
You may have already heard from your home academic unit or perhaps even from instructors of courses in which you are currently enrolled updating you on their plans. If you are seeking clarification on any element of those messages, you are welcome to respond directly to the sender or, if applicable, as detailed in the message text for further guidance. For more general questions about your fall schedule, please contact your academic advisor. Graduate students who have additional questions about their schedules should reach out to their department and/or their advisor.
Thank you for your continued patience and understanding.

          To our students, faculty and staff:
We are pleased to inform you that the federal government on Tuesday rescinded the recent directive from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that placed new restrictions on visas for international students.
The rule had threatened to bar international students who attend universities that will offer only online instruction in response to the pandemic from being in the country. We believed the new rule to be unnecessary, disruptive and harmful to international students and to U.S. higher education in general and had worked to support several legal challenges. That included a lawsuit filed by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and another led by the Illinois Attorney General and 17 other states’ attorneys general, both supported with legal filings by the U of I System and its three universities.
We are gratified to deliver today’s good news, and vow continued support of our international students and their access to the world-class education and opportunities provided by our universities.

                July 13, 2020 5:34 PM

          Dear students, faculty and staff:
Today we’re writing to tell you that the University of Illinois System and its three universities are actively participating in a new legal effort by Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and 17 other attorneys general around the country to challenge the recent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) restrictions on visas for international students.
Attorney General Raoul and his colleagues on Monday filed a lawsuit opposing what they call the federal government’s “cruel, abrupt, and unlawful action.”
The U of I System and its universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield agree with Attorney General Raoul and his colleagues that new ICE restrictions forcing international students whose schools offer online-only instruction to either leave the country or transfer to other schools are disruptive and unnecessary. Included as part of that litigation is a declaration issued on behalf of the system and our universities. We plan a hybrid instruction model that blends in-person and online instruction, but we nonetheless believe the restrictions will be harmful to students elsewhere and to higher education in general.
We also announced on Friday our plans to join litigation filed by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that challenges the new restrictions. We are pleased to update you and tell you that our amicus brief in support of that case was filed on Sunday.
We will continue to do all we can to support our international students and those around the country during this difficult time.

          Dear students, faculty and staff:
We are writing to inform you that the University of Illinois System and its constituent universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield are working aggressively to legally challenge recent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) restrictions on visas for international students.
We plan to file amicus briefs supporting litigation filed by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that challenges the new restrictions. We also are working with our peer institutions, higher education membership associations, and state and federal leaders to explore other potential legal avenues.
The new directives issued by ICE on July 6 would have dramatic adverse impacts on international students across higher education in the United States. The federal Student and Exchange Visitor Program announced that visas would not be issued to students enrolled in universities that offer only online instruction this fall. Those already in the United States would have to either leave the country or transfer to a school offering in-person instruction. Harvard and MIT filed litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts on July 8 seeking to “prevent ICE and [the Department of Homeland Security] from enforcing” the new directive.
Our three universities are planning a hybrid approach to instruction this fall with both on-campus and online components, which should limit the impact on our students. Nevertheless, we are deeply concerned about the severe impact the new directive would have across U.S. higher education and will vigorously defend international students and their access to the world-class educational experiences in our country.
We reiterate our commitment to our international students and will do everything we can to support them, especially now, during this period of extraordinary global challenge.

As we prepare our three universities for new ways of engaging with students this fall because of COVID-19, we are extremely proud that our campuses embrace the diversity of the world that awaits our graduates.
Students from dozens of countries are integral to the globally connected University of Illinois System, and they are valued members of our family. They enrich our universities and greatly enhance the educational experience for all.
So, we are profoundly concerned about new visa limitations announced by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) that would forbid international students from living in our country if their universities operate solely online.
All three of our universities are preparing hybrid models for combined in-person and online instruction this fall. But safety is paramount and plans may be revised if the pandemic worsens. As was done last spring, it may be necessary to quickly shift to a distance-education model to serve the best interests of our students, faculty and staff, as well as the communities we call home.
Opening our doors wide to deserving students from all backgrounds has been at the core of our mission since the University of Illinois’ founding more than a century-and-a-half ago. And now, more than ever, a diversity of backgrounds, ideas and viewpoints is crucial as technology bridges the miles between nations, and as different human cultures and outlooks contribute various perspectives to building a better future together.
In this moment of shared global challenge, we reiterate our commitment to our international students. We will do everything possible to support them as they seek to expand their horizons and benefit from the extraordinary, world-class educational experience found at the University of Illinois System.

        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
Beginning today, free on-campus COVID-19 walk-up testing will be available to all faculty, staff and students at the following locations:
COVID-19 testing sites
Alice Campbell Alumni Center, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday 
The testing tent is located just north of the building along Lincoln Avenue.
Parking is available near the Alice Campbell Alumni Center, on Illinois Street, at Krannert Center for the Performing Arts and in the lot at the corner of Lincoln Avenue and Illinois Street.

State Farm Center, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday 
The testing site can be accessed through the West Main Circle Drive doors.
Parking is available in the circle drive or the Southwest lot.

What to expect
Testing is free.
This walk-up testing is available only to university employees and students.
Individuals should refrain from eating, drinking, tooth brushing, mouth washing, gum chewing and tobacco use for 30 min before submitting their saliva sample.
Individuals will need to show an iCard or Illini ID (through the Illinois App) and will be asked to provide a saliva sample.
The sample collection only takes a few minutes. Typical test results are expected within five hours but can take up to 24 hours.
Individuals should line up outside the site locations while wearing face coverings and practicing social distancing.
Individuals (faculty, staff and students) will be emailed when their results are available in the McKinley Health Center patient portal.
Inclement weather (extreme heat, lightning, etc.) may force us to temporarily close all COVID-19 tent testing sites. Indoor locations will remain open. If you have concerns, please check the university's COVID-19 website or send an email to covid-19@illinois.edu.
The samples will then be assessed using an innovative process developed by our own COVID-19 SHIELD: Target, Test, Tell team. Unlike conventional nasal testing, saliva samples are collected non-invasively, without healthcare workers and with minimal use of PPE. The lab has received federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification.
More on-campus COVID-19 testing sites will be added in the coming weeks, with more than a dozen planned by August. As additional testing sites become available, we will post the most updated hours and locations here on the university’s COVID-19 website. 
All employees can participate in this testing effort during scheduled work hours without loss of pay. As always, it is important that, in consideration of operational needs, employees coordinate with their supervisor for prior approval to go to the testing during scheduled work hours. 
Widespread testing continues to be one of the key approaches in facilitating a successful return to campus operations. Thank you in advance for doing your part to maximize the safety of our university and our community.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

Monday’s announcement by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement of new visa limitations that will not allow most international students to take a fully online course load and still remain in the United States was unexpected and disconcerting. This adds yet another layer of challenging uncertainty in this time of global crisis for our international students here at Illinois. We sent the message below to all of our international students earlier today, and we will continue to communicate directly with them as we get more information.
As you know, we have previously announced our plans to resume on-campus instruction for the Fall 2020 semester with a blend of in-person and remote instruction. And we are asking all of our academic units and all of you to work with our international students to make sure they develop course schedules for the fall semester in consideration of these new restrictions.
We remain a university that is committed to upholding our reputation as a top destination for international students and scholars and a community that welcomes everyone who chooses to come here to live, work and study.

On July 6, 2020, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued much anticipated policy guidance for institutions that enroll international students in F-1 status during the Fall 2020 semester. The information in this email only pertains to students in F-1 status. 
Guidance provided by DHS varies by the model that institutions have selected for fall instruction. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will offer a blend of in-person and remote instruction; this is called a hybrid model. The guidance for the hybrid model is:
“Students attending schools adopting a hybrid model—that is, a mixture of online and in person classes—will be allowed to take more than one class or three credit hours online. These schools must certify to SEVP, through the Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status,” that the program is not entirely online, that the student is not taking an entirely online course load for the fall 2020 semester, and that the student is taking the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree program. The above exemptions do not apply to F-1 students in English language training programs or M-1 students, who are not permitted to enroll in any online courses (see 8 CFR 214.2(f)(6)(i)(G) and 8 CFR 214.2(m)(9)(v)))”.
How does this guidance affect F-1 students at Illinois? Since we have adopted a hybrid model for the Fall 2020 semester, the following is true for our students:
F-1 Students Currently Residing in the United States:
F-1 students may enroll in more than one online class (or three credit hours) but they cannot take all their courses entirely online for the Fall 2020 semester.
F-1 students must continue take the minimum number of online courses required to make normal progress in their degree program.
F-1 Students Residing Outside the United States: 
F-1 students residing outside of the U.S. are permitted to enroll in an online course of study, but they will not be allowed to continue to hold F-1 student status for this period. Therefore, the time spent abroad will not be counted toward the one full academic year in F-1 status required prior to becoming eligible for certain immigration benefits, including Curricular Practical Training (CPT) or Optional Practical Training (OPT). 
F-1 students who have not yet arrived in the U.S. may activate their F-1 status upon arrival in the U.S. If new international students are not able to obtain visas and travel to the U.S. in time to begin the fall semester they may choose to enroll in a remote study option or defer admission. Students who remain outside the U.S. will not be bound by regulatory requirements affecting F-1 students and are therefore not required to be registered full-time.
F-1 Students Registered for Thesis Credit: 
F-1 students registered for thesis credit (such as 599) can remain in F-1 status as long as they continue to make progress towards completion of their degree.
I-20 Issuance:
For all F-1 students attending school in the U.S. in the fall, new I-20s should be issued by Designated School Officials with a special notation, ""the program is not entirely online, that the student is not taking an entirely online course load for the fall 2020 semester, and that the student is taking the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree program."" F-1 students must have this updated I-20 to apply for an entry visa or travel into the U.S. Our International Student and Scholar Services is currently working to clarify this guidance from SEVP officials and will work with campus partners to update I-20s as necessary.
Please bear in mind this is still a fluid situation due to the nature of a global pandemic. We will continue to update you with additional changes and guidance as it becomes available. 
We recognize that this is a stressful time and that this announcement raises additional concerns for our international community. We are all in this together and we remain committed to ensuring that you are not left with a fully online course schedule that jeopardizes your student immigration status. The University, colleges, ISSS and others are working to better understand aspects of the policy that are not yet fully clear. We will continue to support you and advocate for you throughout your studies at Illinois.
Sincerely,
Reitumetse Obakeng MabokelaVice Provost for International Affairs and Global Strategies"

                June 30, 2020 10:01 AM

        Dear Colleagues, 
For nearly a year, the team in the Office of Strategic Marketing and Branding has been hard at work developing new brand standards that will align the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as a single, unified brand. I’m pleased to share that those brand standards, and the guide that will help us all adopt them, will be released next week.
In anticipation of that release, I want to stress how critical this brand strategy is in our collective efforts to elevate the university and connect in powerful ways with our key audiences. It is my expectation that all units across campus will begin adopting and implementing the new brand materials and guidelines over the next six-to-twelve months.
I also want to share how excited I am about the brand that Eric Minor, our Chief Marketing Officer, and his team have developed. The brand is research-based and audience-driven. It celebrates the incredible strength of the university as a whole, while providing flexibility for individual units to celebrate what sets them apart. Most importantly, the brand was developed in collaboration and conversation with many marketing professionals and leaders across campus, and it will further unite us as one bold voice, sharing the University of Illinois story and the Power of I. 
When the brand guidelines are released next week, I encourage everyone to visit the website and learn more about the strategies, messaging, website standards and visual identity that will drive our brand. We should all strive to embody it, no matter what our role is at the university. By this time next year, I look forward to seeing the brand elements everywhere I look across campus, and reaching out across our state, nation and the world.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

                June 26, 2020 2:01 PM

        Dear Students and Employees,
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act requires the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:
http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/
The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.
Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to marijuana in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s marijuana prohibition.
The university’s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.
The university’s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.
Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. University employees should contact Illinois Human Resources at (217) 333-2137.
Sincerely,
Dr. Danita M. B. YoungVice Chancellor for Student Affairs"

          Dear students, faculty, staff and friends:
On June 30, we will say a bittersweet goodbye to University of Illinois at Springfield Chancellor Susan Koch after nearly a decade of distinguished leadership that has lifted UIS to its place as our state’s top-ranked regional public university.
Her send-off into a richly deserved retirement will be far quieter than we hoped. Just as it has with all of our lives, the COVID-19 pandemic has thrown a wrench into our plans to publicly celebrate Susan for everything she has done.
But it is only a delay. When COVID is under control and large gatherings like the one Susan will attract are allowed again, we will bring her back and honor her in person for her countless contributions – new programs, new facilities, new opportunities for students, new connections with the community, new world-class faculty, expanded athletics and record philanthropy.
In the meantime, we have prepared a short video with tributes from a few of the many people whose lives she touched across campus and beyond. We hope it shows her just what a mark she has left. If you get a chance, drop a note to share your thanks, too, and to welcome Interim Chancellor Karen Whitney as she steps in to build on Susan’s legacy.
Sincerely,
Tim"

        Online Teaching Academy
Dear faculty and graduate teaching assistants,
As we plan for Fall 2020 instruction, we anticipate an expanded need for online and hybrid courses to allow for social distancing in learning spaces (classrooms, laboratories, studios). To accommodate faculty and teaching assistants who may need to teach online and who would like to become familiar with tools and techniques for online instruction, we have created an Online Teaching Academy, which was first announced at the end of May.  The June session is currently underway with nearly 500 faculty participating. I write now to share details about the July and August Online Teaching Academies, which will be open to all interested instructors.
Online Teaching Academy
The university’s Online Teaching Academy is an opportunity for faculty and teaching assistants to review good practices and discuss different pedagogical approaches as well as to receive hands-on training on technical tools for online teaching and learning.
During the Academy, faculty will design their online and hybrid fall courses in a community of fellow instructors with the support of campus experts from CITL, Tech Services and college-level educational technology units. Teaching assistants will learn to support the instructional activities of the online classroom.
Sample topics for the Academy include: designing effective video lectures, providing feedback online, creating meaningful student engagement online, designing meaningful online assessments and utilizing online group work.
The July Academy will begin on July 13 and run through July 31. There will be an optional live session once a week on Wednesday from 10am to 11am, which will be recorded. All other sessions will be asynchronous, allowing participants to review at their own pace over the course of the week.
The August Academy will take place from August 3 through August 21. There will be no live sessions for the August Academy, making it completely asynchronous.
The July and August offerings will be open enrollment with no compensation for participation.
To sign up for the July or August Academies, please follow this link: https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/1647465. The deadline to sign up, for either the July or August sessions, is Friday, July 3, 2020.
Thank you for considering this opportunity to receive expert support in your fall course preparations.

                June 23, 2020 3:30 PM

        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
On June 22, 2020, President Trump issued a presidential proclamation that suspends the entry of certain individuals to the U.S. This proclamation goes into effect on June 24, 2020 and will be valid at least through the end of this calendar year. The full text can be found here. We are still reviewing the full impact of the new order on our current faculty, staff and scholars, but it appears that our student population is largely unaffected. We are reaching out directly to members of our university community who may be impacted with more detailed information.
But this latest decision to restrict opportunities for international students and scholars is extremely disappointing and disheartening. 
For more than a century, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has been the institution of choice for the best and brightest international students and scholars. That influx of talent and ideas has brought new educational opportunities to all of the students in all of our programs, and it has contributed enormously to innovations and discoveries that have led to new jobs, new industries and dramatic economic growth for our state and nation. We are proud of our reputation as a global university that truly welcomes our international community.
We will continue to advocate strongly against any actions that are needlessly detrimental to this university. And we will always honor our commitment to support all of our students, faculty, staff and visiting scholars, whether domestic or international.
We are in communication with our federal legislators to ensure that they understand the risk these new immigration limitations pose to the future economic growth and prosperity of the State of Illinois and to the vitality of the state’s flagship university.
We are at our best as a university when our doors are wide open to new ideas, new perspectives and new ways of thought. That is why it is so disappointing to see these new immigration restrictions that will close doors to some of those who would be so welcome here at Illinois.  
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Students,
As you know, fall instruction will happen on-campus with social distancing. In order to lower classroom capacities, we have to make some changes to the class schedule.
Class Schedule Change Details
Student registration activity will be closed from July 11 to August 3 to allow departments, the Office of the Registrar and other central administration units to make necessary schedule modifications in the registration system.
Course changes may include:
Moving fully online
Changing to hybrid delivery (e.g., online lecture, in-person discussion )
New meeting times
New meeting locations
Distributed attendance—(e.g., not all students will attend the in-person class each day; instructors will provide schedule plan)

Beginning July 14, students (including new, incoming students) can view their August time tickets. This time ticket is the first day and time at which you may make modifications to your fall class schedule, if necessary.
The majority of schedule modifications will be completed by 6 p.m. on Friday, July 31. Please be aware that it is still important to continue to check your schedule periodically throughout the month of August, as minor modifications may still be made after July 31.
Your academic advisors, department and/or college offices will be reaching out to you starting in late July. Be sure to read any messages carefully and to connect with your advisor early and often with any concerns or questions.
Once changes to fall classes are finished, we will provide all students with an opportunity to review and modify their schedule, if necessary, prior to the start of the semester.
We appreciate your patience throughout this process. We know that uncertainty is frustrating, but please be assured that we are doing all we can to ensure minimal disruptions to your existing class schedule. We will continue to keep you updated as the process progresses. Thank you for your continued flexibility and understanding as we navigate forward together.
Sincerely,
Kevin PittsVice Provost for Undergraduate Education"

          Dear students, faculty, staff and friends:
Along with unprecedented challenges, 2020 has also brought historic progress.
Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision on LGBTQ rights, ruling that employers cannot fire workers based on sexual orientation or gender identity. It extends the protections of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and accelerates our nation’s course toward inclusion and respect for all. We welcome and celebrate this ruling.
The ruling reflects the values at the very core of our mission across the University of Illinois System. Equality and fairness must underlie everything we do. Our universities open their doors wide to students, faculty and staff from varied backgrounds, varied walks of life and varied points of view. 
The Supreme Court’s ruling provides an excellent opportunity to, once again, reaffirm our bedrock support for all students and for all faculty and staff at our three universities – those who identify as LGBTQ, those with disabilities, those who are veterans of the military, those who come to our institutions from other parts of the world, and those from the rich mix of ethnic, racial, cultural, socioeconomic and religious backgrounds that we cherish. You are all welcome here and, together, you provide the very heartbeat of the University of Illinois System, enriching it as a global leader in education and innovation.

                June 19, 2020 11:56 AM

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
Today, we commemorate the 155th anniversary of the end of slavery in the United States. This day, remembered as Emancipation Day, Jubilee, or more commonly referred to as Juneteenth, marked the victory of those who fought the injustices of slavery. Although, President Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, it was not until 1865 that Major General Gordon Granger brought word to enslaved Black people in Galveston Texas that they were now free.
These are facts that we will hear recounted many times today on the 155th anniversary of Emancipation Day, celebrating the struggle for freedom by enslaved Black people and marking the end of chattel slavery in the United States. For decades, the successes of the civil-rights movement elevated the date from observance to celebration. But in recent years, the tenor of Juneteenth has changed. Black Americans see more clearly just how deeply embedded racism is in the fabric of our society. In a country built on the subjugation of indigenous and Black people, our focus must also be on the fight to dismantle systemic racism. But for too long we have not collectively seen these pieces of our history, understood their implications, or fully reckoned with our responsibilities.
This year’s celebration of Juneteenth marks both a new beginning and the continuation of a process that has taken far too long. We have heard calls for racial justice throughout the years on our own campus, from Project 500 to Being Black at Illinois, a reminder that this fight has stretched not only across the past 400 years, but the entire history of our university. These calls have always been marked by resilience, endurance, resistance and action.
As Vice Chancellor I work every day from the deeply held belief that the progress that we have made since Emancipation Day in 1865 is nowhere near enough. I, like you, am tired of calls, tired of words that do not become substantial systemic change. We strive to be a university that acknowledges the past, recognizes our responsibilities, and find ways to improve broken paths to plan for a better future. It is a work in progress. It is incremental, and it is often insufficient. Equity is not a luxury. Equity requires that we wholly reimagine how we understand our responsibilities to one another, continually assess what we still need to accomplish and commit to improve. Equity demands that we acknowledge that as an institution of higher education we have the responsibility to fight systematic racism and dismantle mechanisms of oppression in order to create a more equal and just society.
Today is a day of celebration and a reminder of the work that we as a university must commit to in order to undo anti-Black racism. The road to achieve full equity is still long. As the Chancellor said yesterday, the past few months have underscored the renewed imperative that actions align with what we stand for. We cannot be a great university if we are not committing our resources – the breadth and depth of our expertise, our talented community of scholars, and the scale of our enterprise – to the betterment our local community while serving our nation to create a better tomorrow. The time to act is now. This Juneteenth marks my renewed commitment to you and the work that we will do together.
Sincerely,
Sean C. GarrickVice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion"

        Dear Students,
As was announced earlier, we will resume on-campus instruction for the Fall 2020 semester in a manner modified to address the ongoing pandemic concerns. The plan assumes that we have adequate COVID-19 testing in place, and we have moved into Phase IV of Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s Restore Illinois plan. Health and safety will continue to be our top priority, and we will rely on every member of our campus community to behave in a way that protects the safety of the entire community.
We plan to offer as much in-person instruction and residential occupancy as restrictions of space, health and safety allow. Face-to-face instruction will be supplemented by online instruction. 
For those students who are not able to come to campus, the university will offer online courses so you can continue to make progress toward your degree.
This message provides some additional details about what to expect. We don’t have all of the answers at this point, but we promise to update you when more information becomes available. You can also find an FAQ here with more of the information we have at this time. We will continue to keep it updated throughout the summer.
Health and Safety
In order for this return to in-person instruction to succeed, everyone in our university community will be required to follow guidelines by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD). This includes practicing social distancing, wearing face coverings (for those who are able), checking symptoms and adequate hygiene such as frequent handwashing and using hand sanitizer.
The university is developing capacity to provide all students, faculty and staff with free, regular testing administered by the university. You will receive more details on this in a separate message.
We are committed to cleaning and sanitizing all university spaces to minimize the potential of the virus to spread. Our Facilities & Services team has developed rigorous sanitation procedures and processes.
We will continue to closely monitor conditions locally and regionally. We will adapt our plans as needed.
Class Delivery
We will maximize in-person classes as much as possible, especially for courses that require hands-on, active and peer-to-peer interactions such as labs, performance-based courses and discussions. Face-to-face instruction will be supplemented by online instruction.
Classes that meet in-person will be in spaces that allow for adequate social distancing. As an added precaution, for the health and safety of all, face coverings will be required in all campus spaces, including classrooms.
Most large class sections are likely to be online or incorporate online components, in accordance with the Restore Illinois plan guidelines on gatherings.
We will have online options for students who are not able or who prefer not to participate in face-to-face or on-campus instruction.
Schedule Changes
Over the next several weeks, we will be making modest adjustments to the Class Schedule to account for these changes. While we anticipate that many student schedules will not require modification, there will be some cases where a scheduling conflict might arise. Please be patient as we work through these changes. We promise that you will have a chance to update your schedule in case anything needs to be modified. We will be back in contact in the future with more details.
We are currently making a determination about which course sections will be offered online versus in-person. Again, please be patient as we work through these details. We will be back in contact in the future with more information. Rest assured that we will help with any changes.
We are excited about the opportunity to resume on-campus operations in the fall. We also take your health and safety very seriously. Please bear with us as we address additional issues related to instruction and campus life in the fall semester. We will continue to keep you updated as more information becomes available.
Thank you for your patience and thank you in advance for doing your part to keep everyone in our university community safe. We will be in touch with more details through the summer months.

                June 18, 2020 3:14 PM

        Dear Faculty, Students and Staff,
As you know, our university leadership has been consulting with faculty, staff, students, the Academic Senate, community members and with local and state health officials to evaluate our options for delivery of Fall 2020 instruction.
All faculty, staff and students will be receiving more detailed information this week about what we know right now. We have posted a new list of some frequently asked questions with answers on the COVID-19 website.
As a public land-grant university, it is our obligation to provide accessible and equitable research, creative expression and educational experiences for people from across the state and around the globe. We come together here to challenge and debate the known, confront and conquer the unknown, advance the frontier of knowledge and improve the human condition. Our success hinges upon the vibrant learning communities that constitute the bedrock of residential universities like ours. All of us, together, share in all the good that our university makes possible. Its classrooms, libraries, rare book and manuscript collections, laboratories, studios, research institutes, performing arts spaces, gathering spaces and museums enable and inspire the face-to-face engagement and debate. This fosters the free and daring inquiry and the rich empathy and candor our world needs to deal with its current challenges and to change and to progress beyond them. The events of the past months make the importance for such conversations, engagement and experiences even more urgent.
The university is committed to doing all we can to maximize the safety of all members of our community. A commitment to the health and safety of our students, staff and faculty will be foundational to any decisions we make and all actions that we take. That is a commitment that also extends to the broader Urbana-Champaign community that supports us.
The university has been working diligently on ways to continue to fulfill our missions as we look to the Fall 2020 semester. In conjunction with public health officials, we have worked with our own experts, faculty and staff to develop plans for fall that prioritize health and safety and allow us to resume some level of in-person instruction and educational activity. Our working groups continue to make considerable progress on all fronts. Earlier this month, the COVID-19 Academics Affairs Team shared their report with the most likely scenarios and recommendations for Fall 2020 instruction. The feedback to the report was robust, diverse and candid. It provided the team with additional things to consider and concerns to address.
Based upon these ongoing efforts, and with considerable thought and broad consultation, we have decided that we will resume on-campus instruction for the Fall 2020 semester in a manner modified to address the ongoing pandemic concerns. This semester will consist of a blend of in-person and remote instruction. Along with a successful transition of our region of Illinois into Phase IV of Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s Restore Illinois plan, resuming on-campus instruction is predicated upon our ability to provide adequate COVID-19 testing for our entire community of faculty, staff and students, coupled with a comprehensive plan that looks after the vulnerable and aims at mitigating and containing any outbreaks. The COVID-19 SHIELD Team is advancing this plan, and they will be providing specific information about the plan in the weeks ahead.
In order for this return to in-person instruction to succeed, everyone in our university community will be required to follow guidelines by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD). This includes practicing social distancing, wearing face coverings (for those who are able), checking symptoms and adequate hygiene such as frequent handwashing and using hand sanitizer.
We cannot overstate that our own personal behavior will determine in a large part our access to all the good that our campus offers. It is up to each of us to take care of one another. In the weeks ahead, as we prepare to resume on-campus operations in the fall, we count on the unfaltering vigilance of everyone in our community. We still have a lot of work to do to get ready.
Thank you for your patience and thank you in advance for doing your part to keep everyone in our university community safe. We will continue to keep you informed about progression of our plans to reopen our campus in a safe manner.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

                June 18, 2020 2:57 PM

          Dear students, faculty and staff:
We are very pleased to announce that on-campus educational activities will resume this fall at the University of Illinois System’s three universities, with a hybrid mixture of in-person and online classes. Of course, our collective decision assumes that Illinois stays on track to meet Phase 4 requirements established by Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s Restore Illinois plan that allow reopening of classrooms.
Plans to restore in-person instruction were developed through weeks of exhaustive review that brought together literally hundreds of key stakeholders and considered every available option, from a full return to traditional instruction to remaining fully online. 
Throughout, this work was guided by two, intertwined core principles – promoting the safety of our campus communities while maintaining the academic excellence that is synonymous with our best-in-class universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield. In the process, faculty, staff, administrative leaders and students drew upon the insights of our own healthcare and education experts, as well as best practices of peer institutions and guidance from state and local health departments, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Illinois Board of Higher Education.
The result is a thoughtful, science-based approach that will bring our universities back to life, with a campus experience that will look somewhat different. But the life-changing benefits will be the same – academic programs that lift students to the careers of their dreams, research that drives discovery and progress, and a healthcare enterprise that provides both patient care and innovation.
A system-wide coordination committee assisted groups at each of the three universities that have worked over the past few weeks to develop detailed plans for reopening. Each university will be providing details of their unique, campus-based plans within the next few weeks, including starting dates and calendars for their fall semesters. But here is a summary of elements that will be common to all:  
Instruction
Classes will be a mixture of in-person and remote instruction to provide the physical distancing that inhibits spread of the virus.
In-person courses and classroom schedules will be adjusted appropriately to ensure physical distancing and safer traffic flow.
Accommodations will be made where possible for students and faculty in vulnerable and at-risk groups, and for students who cannot come to campus due to travel restrictions or other considerations.
Classrooms will be cleaned and disinfected daily.
Reusable, washable masks will be provided to all students and required in all classrooms, and hand sanitizer will be widely available in all buildings.
Training for faculty and instructors is being provided over the summer to sustain high-quality online and distance instruction with state-of-the-art technologies and virtual modalities.
University housing/dining
Residence hall occupancy will be limited to two students per room.
Outside visitors will not be allowed in residence halls.
Quarantine areas will be created to accommodate students who test positive for COVID-19 or display symptoms.
Dining halls will largely provide packaged meals for carryout, and in-person dining will be limited.
Common areas will be cleaned and disinfected regularly, and hand sanitizer will be available.
Use of these common areas will be limited, and physical distancing will be observed.
Campus life
The size of gatherings will be based on standards under the state reopening guidelines in force this fall and beyond.
Use of auxiliary facilities such as recreational centers will be limited to preserve safety.
Outside visitors to campus will be asked to follow physical distancing and wear masks in public places.
Research
Research activities will continue a ramp-up that began over the summer.
As in classrooms, masks will be required and other safety measures will be followed.
Research will continue to support treatments, vaccines and other measures related to COVID-19.
Employees
Most faculty and staff will continue a phased-in return to work that began in June and will be completed by the start of the fall semester, though some will continue to work from home to reduce campus density.
Flexible work-from-home guidelines will be developed for the benefit of vulnerable employees and those with family-related considerations.
Work areas will be cleaned regularly, and hand sanitizer will be provided.
Masks will be required in publicly shared spaces and reusable masks will be provided to all employees.
We will continue engagement with our labor unions to discuss the impact of these plans.
Testing and notification
Our scientists are piloting cutting-edge testing procedures for the COVID-19 virus that are accurate, cost-effective and scalable to the whole university community and provide same-day results. 
We are partnering closely with local public health authorities to notify individuals at risk for infection and mitigate spread, through a combination of manual and rapid app-based approaches.
All app-based software will protect individual privacy so that positive test results are shared only with the user, and no location data will be required, collected or shared with third parties. Local public health departments will be provided test results based on required local, state and federal regulations.
General safety
Training will be required for all students and employees to ensure compliance with physical distancing and other COVID-related safety measures.
Hand sanitizer or disposable wipes will be available at building entrances, elevator lobbies and in common and high-traffic areas.
High-touch surfaces such as door handles and elevator buttons will be disinfected multiple times daily.
Flu shots will be strongly encouraged for all students, faculty and staff to lessen the possibility of dual outbreaks when traditional flu season begins.
The pandemic is still evolving, so our plans will be flexible and nimble. We will monitor campus safety and the latest guidance on the virus, and will adjust plans as needed to protect the well-being of our students, faculty, staff and the communities we call home.
Our plans for fall could not have been developed without you, and we are deeply grateful to everyone who shared their time and talents to guide us. And we know that you will now help lead the way again, modeling the safety protocols that are essential to make our plans a success.
The COVID-19 pandemic has been a test unlike any in our 150-year history. But thanks to your commitment and creativity, we have done more than just answer challenges to our operations. You are supporting the leading-edge medical treatments and scholarship that are helping the state manage the crisis and move beyond it. You are helping show the life-changing power of our universities – in real-time – that will write new chapters in our long legacy of excellence.
Be safe, enjoy your summer and we look forward to seeing you in the fall.

                June 18, 2020 2:42 PM

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
Earlier you received a message from President Killeen about today’s United States Supreme Court decision that will allow the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program recipients to continue to renew membership in the program that offers them work authorization and temporary protection from deportation. We are most vibrant as a nation when we welcome and support the most vulnerable among us to excel in their academic, creative and professional endeavors. Equity and inclusion are essential to our well-being as a society so that every one of us has an opportunity to pursue our dreams and transform our lives and the lives of others. Today’s decision affirms those values.
In the past few months, we have become acutely aware of how interconnected each of us is, and of the renewed imperative that actions align with what we stand for. We must act in ways that protect the most marginalized among us, dismantle systems that exclude and oppress, and as a university we must fight fiercely to protect the dreams and humanity of each and every one of us. The success of our university rests firmly on the principle of inviting the best and brightest into our community and supporting their capacity to thrive. The skills, imagination and determination that DACA recipients bring to our community represents the best of who we are as university. We vigorously advocate for actions, laws and policies that protect and advance that principle. The University of Illinois is committed to providing an accessible, world-class education for qualified and deserving students in the State of Illinois and beyond.
Our university will continue to provide access to financial support for DACA and undocumented students at both the university and state levels, and we will continue to protect confidential student and employee information to the fullest extent of the law. Consistent with its long-standing policy, the University of Illinois Police Department (UIPD) will not ask anyone about their immigration status, and UIPD does not arrest anyone solely on the basis of their immigration status.
Additional information about campus policies and resources related to DACA and members of our community who are undocumented can be found at https://open.illinois.edu.

                June 18, 2020 2:26 PM

          Dear students, faculty and staff:
Today, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a bid to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, ruling that proper procedures were not followed in the effort to rescind DACA.
We are grateful that DACA will remain in effect, providing a pathway to degrees without fear of deportation. More than 450,000 undocumented students are currently enrolled in colleges and universities nationally, a new study shows, including hundreds at our universities.
DACA reflects our values and our land-grant mission to open our doors wide, provide a high-quality education for every deserving student and create the next-generation workforce that is essential to move America forward. 
We hope DACA will now be allowed to stand, and end the fears and uncertainty that our undocumented students have felt since the legal battle began. And we will continue to advocate for federal legislation expanding their rights through the Dream Act, which would provide an opportunity to become citizens of what for many is the only country they have ever known.

        Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
It is my pleasure to share with you that Alice Cary will become the Executive Director of Public Safety and Chief of Police starting July 20 pending approval by the Board of Trustees.
Cary is currently the chief of police at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, where she has worked tirelessly to implement the 21st Century Policing approach founded on building trust and legitimacy, policy and oversight, training and education, community policing and crime reduction, technology and social media, as well as officer safety and wellness.
In her current university law enforcement leadership role, she established a dedicated Campus Outreach and Support Team (COAST) that engages with the campus and the greater community to build trust through establishing personal relationships, improving communications, operating transparently and demonstrating a commitment to serving all people.
I want to thank the search committee for their diligent work in identifying an excellent pool of finalists, and I offer thanks to Interim Chief Matt Myrick for his leadership in this transition period and the entire Division of Public Safety for their service year after year.
There is no higher priority for us than ensuring that our community is as safe and secure as possible for our students, faculty, staff and visitors to work, live and learn. I’m excited to have Alice Cary lead that effort for us.

        Dear Colleagues,
I am pleased to announce the appointment of Professor Gene Robinson as interim dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences designate beginning on July 1. This appointment is pending approval by the Board of Trustees. Professor Robinson’s selection comes after consultation and discussions with other executive officers, senior academic leaders and members of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Executive Committee
Professor Robinson brings more than three decades of experience as a faculty member, academic leader and university administrator here at Illinois. A faculty member of the Department of Entomology, he is a Swanlund Professor and the current director of the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology. With membership in two of our National Academies, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the recipient of the prestigious Wolf Prize in Agriculture, he is a world-renowned scholar and teacher. His extensive knowledge and experience at every level of this institution will serve the College well during this critical year ahead.
A national search for the permanent dean of LAS will begin this summer. In the weeks ahead, I will consult with the College’s executive committee, department heads, faculty and staff about forming the search committee and I will share that information when it is finalized. It is my intention to have a new permanent dean in place for the start of the 2021 academic year.
Professor Robinson has agreed to serve in this role for the next year, at which point he will be resuming his permanent role as director at IGB. His IGB five-year review will continue as planned this summer.
I want to thank Dean Feng Sheng Hu for his leadership of LAS and his long faculty service to his college and university. I am deeply appreciative of his efforts over these final months of his Illinois tenure to help us navigate the unprecedented challenges the COVID-19 pandemic has brought.

                June 3, 2020 10:03 AM

        Dear faculty, staff and students,
As you know, in April I charged the COVID-19 Academic Affairs Team to consider strategies for Fall 2020 instruction in the context of the COVID-19 global pandemic. I asked this group to identify instructional options informed by a variety of COVID-19 health and safety conditions that may be present in the fall, and to catalog the benefits and weaknesses of each option. I did not ask this group to make any decision about whether to have students return to campus. They have prepared this draft report sharing their analysis and recommendations, and I hope you will read it.
Report Highlights 
The health and safety of the community must be the most important consideration in any decision about Fall 2020 instruction. “Normal operations” (i.e., full face-to-face instruction) are highly unlikely to be a viable option for the fall given the current understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the guidance provided to us from our state’s officials about the anticipated state of the pandemic in Illinois in the fall.
The task force focused much of its effort on evaluating the feasibility of a modified approach to on-campus instruction, including a combination of in-person and online classes. This approach is appropriate only if:  
The University will have met all of the requirements necessary to proceed to Phase IV of the governor's Restore Illinois plan.
The campus and community will have adequate testing/tracing/exposure notification/quarantine capabilities and procedures in place, cleaning protocols and guidelines and procedures for safe campus operations. This includes testing all campus community members as they return to campus in August, along with a robust continuous testing strategy.
Students, faculty and staff will be required to agree to behave in a manner that maximizes the safety of the entire university community. This includes use of face covering as able and, when necessary, social distancing and other safe public health practices carried out on-campus and off.
Physical space and time necessary to carry out instruction have priority over non-academic or co-curricular activities.

The report also identifies several objectives for modified face-to-face instruction:
New and continuing students who do not return to campus for any reason must have access to courses and opportunity to make progress toward their degree.
Instructional faculty who are unable to return to campus for reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic should still have opportunities to teach and engage students remotely.
Even as the University must rely on remote course delivery for modified instruction, we should strive to maximize face-to-face instruction to the degree that safety allows.
To the extent feasible, units should have the ability to determine the appropriate delivery modality for their own courses.
The University should utilize face-to-face instruction where it can have the most impact on the student experience, in places like performance courses, studio experiences, laboratories and peer-interaction/peer-learning situations.

The report analyzes possible actions that will be necessary under any modified approach, including but not limited to the following:
Classroom space will be limited due to social distancing, requiring holding more classes at off-peak times, including evenings, and the use of non-academic spaces for classrooms.
Passing time between classes will likely have to be lengthened and protocols for entering and exiting classrooms developed.
Based on the recommendation by the SHIELD Team to minimize the number of times students return to campus, the Task Force proposes to start the semester as scheduled, and terminate face-to-face instruction on November 20, the beginning of Fall Break. The final 8 days of instruction along with 6 days of final exams would be conducted remotely.
The University should provide support for instructional faculty to develop courses in new modalities that strive to provide students with an excellent learning experience.

If the conditions for Phase IV status stated in Governor Pritzker’s Restore Illinois plan are not met, the University will have to adopt a fully online format.
I hope you will take a look at the full report and offer your feedback using this form by 5 p.m. on Wednesday, June 10. Chancellor Jones and I will review this report and your feedback and announce a plan for Fall 2020 instruction in mid-June.
Thank you for your continued patience as we work together to make the best possible decisions for our students, faculty, staff and community for Fall 2020.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

                June 2, 2020 12:16 PM

        Dear Colleagues,
In a massmail earlier today, the University of Illinois System summarized the overall budget situation and outlined the framework that our three universities are implementing to mitigate the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This message offers some more specific information about how our university will use that framework to protect our core missions and to allow us the greatest fiscal flexibility and margin to adapt to the extended economic challenges over the next one-to-three years.
We will also hold a live-streamed COVID-19 budget and finance briefing this Friday (June 5) at noon. I will be joined by Provost Andreas Cangellaris and Associate Chancellor for Budget and Resource Planning Paul Ellinger. We will be discussing the state’s preliminary budget framework and taking a number of questions submitted to us by campus business directors and budget committees. I invite you to watch the live-stream Friday at https://go.illinois.edu/covid-19briefing. This will be the first in our regular COVID-19 Briefing Series of live updates linked to our Return to On-Campus Operations Working Teams.
The state legislature’s action to provide state funding at the same level as last year was certainly welcome news and a vote of confidence in our institution. The funding bill awaits the governor’s approval. But with the pandemic’s massive negative impacts to state, national and global economies we realize that the state faces economic and cash flow challenges. The experience with the budget impasse of 2016-17, when cash-flow issues caused significant delays in state payments and, ultimately, a $189 million shortfall in our state funding is still vivid in our minds.
Our careful and thoughtful planning now will allow us to respond quickly, strategically and efficiently to the uncertain financial landscape that we must navigate in the months and years ahead.
Key Considerations in Our Budget Planning and Modeling:
So far, based on projections into this July, the estimated financial COVID-19 costs to our university in terms of additional expenditures, lost revenue and fee adjustments exceed $81 million. This estimate is expected to grow as we move through the summer and into the fall. In particular, we must anticipate and plan for potential tuition losses due to pandemic-imposed restrictions on residential programs, ability of international students to travel and attendance decisions by our returning students.
Additionally, declines in housing and concessions revenue as well as revenue from externally facing events and programs are possible in the near term. Self-supporting operations that depend on visitor/external revenue support (camps, conferences, arts, entertainment and athletics, for example) are particularly exposed to risk due to activity limitations. And the uncertainty of federal research funding and private philanthropy in the months and years ahead needs to be managed proactively and thoughtfully.
In summary, the financial impacts from COVID-19 will affect all major sources of revenue and all campus units across all missions. And given that it is hard to predict how long this pandemic and its fiscal implications will linger, we must consider scenarios for fiscal mitigation and recovery plans for the university that will continue for several years.
Some Key Actions and Strategies We Are Implementing:
We will continue to use the new Integrated and Value-Centered Budgeting model. We are working with tuition-generating units to consider mitigating factors.
We are temporarily delaying selected strategic planning investments. This includes delaying the latest round of funding for our Investment for Growth initiative.
We have implemented new hiring review processes that will evaluate requests for both mission-critical need as well as the budgetary impacts of the pandemic on a unit’s ability to sustainably fund positions. We expect many vacant positions to remain open for an extended period.
Working closely with all units, we are moving strategically and expeditiously to identify opportunities for operational efficiencies through operational excellence and benchmarking initiatives.
We are reducing travel and related expenses.
We are focusing on cost savings we can realize from reductions in non-personnel expenses, such as supplies and purchased services.
We are slowing down or postponing capital projects to preserve cash reserves and financial flexibility.
We are reviewing cash reserves across campus with the intent to pool these as a resource to offset some of the increased costs and reduced revenues. As we have done in previous uncertain budget situations, we have asked all units to hold a portion of cash and state funding allocation in reserve in case there is a need for a cash rescission later in the year.
We have asked units to prepare financial projections based on 5 to 10% reductions in state/tuition allocation for all campus units (including centrally budgeted units). 
Furloughs, pay reductions and layoffs, and across-the-board budget cuts are not in our current financial planning and we will employ other mitigation strategies before we consider any such options.
We are beginning to evaluate the possibility of early retirement programs as a longer-term mitigation strategy.
The budget news from our state was better than many expected. Yet, we are in the early stages of a challenging budgetary environment. Navigating our way through it in a manner that protects the integrity of our core missions will require determination, patience, cooperation, collaboration and fiscal discipline across every department, unit and college. This is our university and I know I can count on all of us to share the financial burden. This is the only way we will be able to continue to serve our students, achieve our full mission as a public, land-grant research university and look after the well-being and the livelihoods of our people to the best of our ability.
Out of our personal commitment to demonstrating that shared responsibility, I, along with all five of our vice chancellors, have volunteered to take a 10 percent pay reduction for the next six months. This savings will be directed specifically to our Illinois Cares: COVID-19 Emergency Support Fund to assist students in need. And I am very proud to announce that Director of Athletics Josh Whitman, Coach Lovie Smith and Coach Brad Underwood have stepped forward and volunteered to take the same reduction.  
But there are many, many other creative, effective and important ways everyone on this campus can help ensure that the financial impacts of COVID-19 do not damage the core missions of our university.
This collective approach and careful stewardship and planning helped us navigate shortfalls that at times approached $189 million just a few years ago.
Over the past few months, the determination and resilience of our university community have been inspiring. We continue to remain focused on the importance of our mission as the state’s flagship university. We are contributing vital expertise and services to the state’s efforts to manage and overcome the COVID-19 challenges. And I am confident we will lead the way to a post-COVID-19 environment rich in ideas and novel programs that will help us all thrive and help to rebuild the economic and social vitality of our communities.
I ask you to help us find and implement those ideas and approaches as we navigate through the financial impacts of COVID-19 that now face our university.

                June 2, 2020 12:01 PM

          Dear colleagues:
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the University of Illinois System and on each of us. We are so proud of the dedicated efforts by our faculty and staff to ensure that our missions of teaching, research, public service and economic development have continued with excellence during these challenging times. And despite these stresses, we have taken on new work to combat the virus – pioneering research on medical devices and drug treatments, providing epidemiological modeling to state leaders, issuing data-rich policy analyses, and most importantly, caring for vulnerable patients at UI Hospital and clinics. 
Of course, the pandemic has had a financial impact on much of what we do. The three universities have incurred significant expenses to adapt to distance education and remote work. We also have incurred revenue losses from adjusting room and board and several fee charges to students, and from cancelled programs and clinic activities. 
Similarly, our hospital has incurred many unanticipated expenses in order to treat those afflicted with this disease, while at the same time experiencing a decline in patient care revenue because of the required focus on COVID-19 patients. 
We are grateful for federal funding provided through the CARES Act. Unfortunately, that funding will not be enough to cover our costs. The fiscal challenges are likely to deepen in the coming months as the impact of the pandemic continues.
To manage the financial impact prudently, we are asking all units across the U of I System to immediately:
curtail hiring and only fill vacant positions that are critical to our missions
reduce travel and related expenses
reduce non-personnel expenses, such as supplies and purchased services and
slow down or postpone capital projects, except for those that are strategically vital and those already in process
Each university will provide detailed instructions to implement these new guidelines and budget planning for the upcoming year that address their specific institutional structures and allow them to continue to provide world-class instruction, cutting-edge research and scholarship and positively impact the citizens of Illinois and beyond.
Regrettably, we will not be able to provide a regular, merit-based salary program for the upcoming academic year. Salary increments will be limited to compression, equity, and promotional adjustments only. If our financial circumstances turn out to be better than expected, we will reconsider this decision later in the year.
Finally, members of the senior executive teams of the University of Illinois System and of its three universities, will all be taking a 10 percent pay reduction for six months of the upcoming academic year. This includes the president, the system vice presidents, and the chancellors and vice chancellors of the universities. The savings will be used to augment an emergency aid relief fund we created to support students who face financial challenges due to the pandemic.
We believe these steps, if implemented diligently, will help us manage the financial shortfall we face without resorting to furloughs or significant layoffs, actions we hope to avoid unless the situation worsens.
We have faced financial difficulties before, most recently during the 2016-17 state budget impasse. Together, we made many hard decisions, but we advanced our missions and thrived amid adversity. We are confident that working together we can fight this pandemic and emerge even stronger among the nation’s top public university systems.
Once again, we want to thank you for your understanding, adaptability and dedication. We will keep you updated about our finances as we move forward.

        Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,
Thank you for your cooperation in postponing our return to on-campus operations plans earlier this week.
I am writing to share that we are now ready to resume the plans to strategically and incrementally begin the return to on-campus operations process.
Units are now clear to resume implementing their return plans. This includes those involved in essential maintenance of our facilities or working in research labs and facilities. As a reminder, PIs and lab managers must have verified COVID-19 Safety SOPs in place before returning to onsite research activities.
Again, unless you were already instructed to begin reporting to campus this week, please do not change your personal current working arrangements until you are given specific new guidance by your supervisor.
I want to take this opportunity to thank our University of Illinois Police Department (UIPD) for their assistance in facilitating and supporting the peaceful demonstrations, so our community members could exercise their First Amendment rights. I am proud of UIPD’s continued efforts to build positive relationships across our campus and into the greater community, and I am proud of those members of our campus community who protested peacefully.
As I have said many times, these are days when the well-being of our community depends entirely on our collective commitment to care for one another.

        Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,
As you know, in many communities around the nation and in our state, the reactions to the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer have moved beyond peaceful protest. Today, here in our local community, we are experiencing vandalism and looting.
We believe this unrest and disruption is likely to continue for an unknown period of time and in an abundance of caution for the welfare of all members of our campus community, all faculty, staff and students are to continue their current remote-working arrangements until further notice. Please do not return to campus unless you have specifically received permission to do so from your supervisor.
Faculty, staff and student workers involved in areas with specialized considerations such as those involved in essential maintenance of our facilities or working in research labs and facilities will receive further detailed guidance from your unit administrator this evening and throughout the duration of this situation. If you do not receive any new guidance, you should not return to campus.
The right of members of our community to assemble, protest and raise their voices is one of the fundamental values of this university. And as these next uncertain days unfold, we want to do all we can to ensure that our students, faculty and staff are free and safe to choose how they want to face this difficult time.
As we expressed yesterday, these are days when the well-being of our community depends entirely on our collective commitment to care for one another. This is when we most need to come together.

                May 31, 2020 2:01 PM

          Dear students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends:
A thunderous choir of voices rose across our nation again this week, condemning yet another senseless and disturbing killing of a Black man that has reopened deep wounds and fomented waves of anger, frustration and division.
The horrifying image of George Floyd dying as a police officer knelt on his neck is one that will be forever burned into our national consciousness. We hope that it will be the one that finally steers us onto a path of real change, toward the America that we can and must become.
We have stood at this same point far too often in recent history, from Rodney King and Trayvon Martin to the shooting deaths of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor earlier this year.
Every time, we felt the same outrage, and shared the same vow to finally achieve the true equality and justice that has evaded our country for far too long.
Every time, it has carried a heavy emotional and physical toll on the African-American community, spawning a new round of fear, distrust and anger. That toll, this time, is magnified by a global pandemic that has upended all of our lives, but has been disproportionately cruel to minority and underserved communities.
Let us make this outrageous act of aggression a pivotal point in history that begins to reverse generations of systemic racism and discrimination.
Let it start here and let it start now.
We must collectively work to spread the University of Illinois System’s bedrock commitment to inclusion, understanding and justice. Anything less from each and every one of us will undermine the future we all dream of creating – one that is truly worthy of our vibrant and diverse learning communities.

Tim KilleenPresident

        Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,
We, along with so many, are struggling to fully comprehend the systemic violence and the actions of members of the Minneapolis Police Department that resulted in the death of George Floyd this week. This is the home of one of the members of our Big Ten university family and our thoughts are with our colleagues and the broader Minneapolis-St. Paul community today.
And while George Floyd is who we see and mourn this week, we have also witnessed the senseless deaths of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor this spring.
We stand in the middle of a global health crisis that will claim hundreds of thousands of lives and burden millions of others for a generation to come. These are days when the health of our communities depends entirely on our collective commitment to care for one another. This is when we most need to come together.
It is painful to watch streets filled with more anger and more violence sparked by divisive sources of hatred that our nation seems unable to set aside even when we are all threatened by this virus that does not discriminate in choosing who it harms.
For some of us, this is very, very personal. But the grief, sadness and loss is profound and universal.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a community committed to the scholarship, engagement, equity, inclusion and leadership that dismantles systems that utilize power, privilege and violence to disenfranchise, diminish and destroy.
And unfortunately, this same pandemic that has disrupted so much, also prevents us from coming together physically here at Illinois. We are not able to help each other process what we are seeing and what we are feeling in the way we would wish. So, today, when we cannot raise our voices together, we want to share this message in the hope that it will remind everyone that we do not have to remain silent alone.  
George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery. Breonna Taylor. We can say their names and we can help ensure that they are not allowed to be forgotten.

        Dear Colleagues:
As you know, this week saw our region of the state progress into Phase Three of Gov. J. B. Pritzker’s Restore Illinois plan. This is welcome news for our entire community, and our university will continue to implement actions and develop plans to maximize the health and safety of our staff, faculty, students and community members.
Beginning June 1, it is possible that some additional employees will start to return to on-campus work. However, I want to remind you that your own personal current working arrangements will remain in place until you are given specific new guidance. Any changes to those working arrangements will come with notice to make any necessary personal arrangements and information about additional safety and health precautions that will be in place.
Those who work in laboratory research environments need to take additional steps. Principal investigators and lab managers must develop COVID-19 Safety Standard Operating Procedures and incorporate them into their lab safety plans, and lab personnel must read and acknowledge these safety plans and complete additional training. You will not be asked to return to work until these steps have been completed and verified by unit executive officers and the Division of Research Safety. If you have been approved to return to your lab, this process has been completed.
I know there are many questions in these very early days of this careful and phased transition. And as I have said previously, the return to on-campus operations will be different from unit to unit.
I am writing to share three sources of information that I hope will help address some of these questions or guide you to the best source for an answer:
Compiled Plans for Returning to On-Campus Operations
We asked our senior leadership team, including vice chancellors, deans and institute directors, to develop their own detailed planning frameworks for how and when additional employees might start returning to some level of on-campus operations.
Those plans have been reviewed and approved by our COVID-19: Executive Steering Committee on Return to On-Campus Operations, and units are now beginning to implement them.
Those plans have been compiled into this single, public document here.
We have redacted personal or private information in this document following the same standards we use in Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request responses.
Implementation of these plans will continue to involve careful consultation of public health expertise, with new campus-level guidance also expected from the Campus Executive Steering Committee and working groups.
Later this summer, the committee will help units assess progress, identify any emerging challenges and share best practices that have been identified in the initial return efforts.
RETURN TO CAMPUS: What You Need to Know  
This is a web resource to provide a central starting point for information about some of the most frequently asked questions we are receiving as we begin this transition.
This resource will continue to expand as we move further into Phase Three and Phase Four of the governor’s Restore Illinois plan.
University COVID-19 Website and COVID-19 Email
The COVID-19 Communications and Updates Archive is a running archive of all of the major central campus announcements and messages related to our COVID-19 planning and decisions since the beginning of the spring semester.
The Frequently Asked Questions Archive is a frequently updated archive of answers to a number of campus-level questions about COVID-19 and its impact on university programs and operations.
If you have questions that are not answered by these resources, please email covid-19@illinois.edu.
I know this is a complicated and difficult time for us all. And while the transition into the next phase of the Restore Illinois plan is welcome news, I realize each of these transitions will bring new challenges and new questions we will need to address together. Thank you for your patience and your continuing efforts to prioritize the health and safety of every member of our campus and our local community.

Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear faculty,
As we plan for Fall 2020 instruction, we anticipate an expanded need for online and hybrid courses to allow for social distancing in learning spaces (classrooms, laboratories, studios), accommodate faculty who may need to teach online and serve students who are unable to return to campus due to international travel restrictions or for personal reasons.
Online Teaching Academy
We are pleased to announce the university’s Online Teaching Academy, an opportunity for faculty to review good practices and discuss different pedagogical approaches as well as to receive hands-on training on technical tools for online teaching and learning.
During the Academy, faculty will design their online and hybrid fall courses in a community of fellow instructors with the support of campus experts from CITL, Tech Services and college-level educational technology units.
Sample topics for the Academy include: designing effective video lectures, providing feedback online, creating meaningful student engagement online, designing meaningful online assessments and utilizing online group work.
The Academy will take place from June 8 through July 2. Condensed versions of the Academy will be offered in July and August.   
The June Academy will include three-hour live online sessions on Tuesday and Thursday from 9 a.m. to noon for the first three weeks. Faculty will be given tasks to work on for their courses in between the live sessions. The fourth and final week will involve independent work time, with support on-hand. Live sessions from the Academy will be recorded.
If you are unavailable for some of the live meetings, you can still participate if you watch the recordings and complete the course design tasks on-pace with the Academy.
The June offering of the Academy is aimed primarily at those who have not taught online before and are developing content for Fall 2020 instruction. Please note that Spring 2020 experience with remote instruction will not be counted as online teaching experience for this purpose. Because the Academy is a combination of instruction as well as content development, compensation will be provided for participants that complete the elements of the Academy. 
The July and August offerings will be open enrollment with no compensation for participation. Dates, details and enrollment information will be provided at a later date.
Details on eligibility, sign-up and compensation will be available soon through your department or college. 
Thank you for considering this opportunity to receive expert support in your fall course preparations.

        Dear Colleagues,
The University is working within the parameters of guidance and direction provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the State of Illinois, agencies such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and others to prepare for employees to return to on-campus operations.
While no final decisions have been made, it is possible that some employees will start to return to on-campus work beginning on or soon after June 1, 2020. However, your own personal current working arrangements will remain in place until you are given specific new guidance. Any changes to your working arrangements will come with sufficient notice to make any necessary personal arrangements and information about additional safety and health precautions that will be in place.  
Please be assured that we are working to return to on-campus working in a safe and responsible way. The use of good handwashing hygiene, face coverings and maintaining the principles of social distancing are important ways we can keep each other safe as we return to on-campus working. To reduce the transmission of COVID-19 infection, all University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign students, employees and visitors who are medically able to do so must wear a face covering in any university building, facility and classroom unless they are physically isolated in a private space or room. The University also requires maintaining six feet of social distancing whenever possible. We will provide two washable, reusable masks for employees and signage will remind all of us of our handwashing, face covering and social distancing requirements. 
We recognize that some employees may have unique individual circumstances that make it difficult to transition immediately from working at home or may have health or other considerations that present an elevated risk related to COVID-19. Please discuss with your supervisor or unit HR contact, as soon as possible, if you have a need to continue your current remote-work arrangements. If you are unable to reach an agreement with your supervisor regarding your remote-work arrangement, please contact your unit HR representative or the Labor and Employee Relations area within Illinois Human Resources at IHR-LER@illinois.edu or 217.333.3105. You are not required to share any medical information with your supervisor or HR representatives. Please note that, in some cases, referral to other university units or accommodation processes may be required in accordance with applicable regulations.
Factors to consider when evaluating whether you may need to extend your remote working arrangement may include:
If you or a member of your household fall into one of the categories identified by the CDC as being at high risk for serious complications from the COVID-19 virus, as public health authorities advise consideration of continuing to work remotely when possible; and/or
If schools, day-care centers or day camps are closed or unavailable and you would need to care for a child.
While we cannot guarantee that all requests to delay or modify your transition to on-campus work will automatically be granted, we are committed to finding ways to being flexible with our common goal of returning to on-campus operations in a safe manner.

                May 26, 2020 4:17 PM

        Dear Colleagues,
There have been a number of recent messages (May 6, May 12, May 21) with information about the broad planning efforts underway for a safe return to some level of on-campus operations through the summer. We want to give a more in-depth update on the status of our contingency planning and the operational considerations we are evaluating to make this important decision.
We still anticipate announcing our fall instruction plans in mid-June. I know I speak for all of us when I say that Booker T. Washington’s conviction that “there is no education which one can get from books and costly apparatus that is equal to that which can be gotten from contact with great men and women” is the bedrock on which universities like ours have built their reputation and stellar record as agents for good and prosperity for the world through free inquiry, education, discovery and creative expression. It is for this reason that we are working diligently toward the development of a plan for our return to the residential campus experience, guided by expert scientific and medical advice, in a manner that prioritizes everyone’s safety and well-being.
The Academics Contingency Planning team has been meeting for several weeks and consulting with faculty, deans, directors and instructional staff across the campus to identify a set of possible instructional scenarios and the logistics of the corresponding implementation. The recommendations and direction from the other six working COVID-19 teams will also play an important role in defining the nature of the fall semester.
While there are many considerations and assumptions that must be made in this process, these are the two that are most important.
We will not resume any level of on-campus instruction or operations if we do not believe we can do so in a way that maximizes safety. That level will be based on guidance from local and state public health officials, on our capacity for campus and community testing and tracing, on our capacity to provide the necessary personal protective equipment, on our university community’s pledge to look after one another’s well-being through our commitment to self-care and on our ability to comprehensively mandate and enforce the use of face coverings and other social distancing practices.
We will be able to provide flexible and equally accessible alternative options that allow for the protection or isolation of students, faculty and instructional staff who are unable to participate in in-person instructional environments. 
Given the current status of the pandemic and based on data models from our own researchers and others, we are hopeful that the fall semester will be delivered through some hybrid of in-person and remote delivery. We are evaluating scenarios based on that possibility. But if conditions require us to move to a fully remote semester, we must be prepared for that as well. Even with an expected smaller starting residential population, we will need to implement a number of additional significant steps to reduce the population density in physical spaces to meet the levels recommended by our state and local health officials.
We anticipate that the social distancing requirements in our instructional spaces, combined with issues related to airflow, ventilation and other safety considerations will mean most of our traditional classrooms will be limited to about 20-35% of their normal capacity.
We will need to develop approaches that offer class meeting opportunities to offset the space limitations. This goal can be partially achieved by more efficient utilization of these spaces (e.g., extending the instructional day, scheduling class meetings during traditionally lower-used days and times) but more online options are going to be needed.
These new space limitations, in combination with the expectation of a number of students and faculty who are unable to be physically present on campus, will also require us to provide a significant amount of material online.
We recognize the challenges of generating online content for the fall on such short notice, and we are establishing an Online Teaching Academy that will be offered to our faculty and instructors this summer to help them prepare for the fall term.
Modifications to our timetable/class schedule to allow for more passing times between classes to reduce congestion and density in hallways and public spaces may be necessary.
We are also considering how modifications to our schedules and delivery methods will impact our faculty and instructors, the student experience and the community in which we live and work. Important guiding questions we are asking include:
How do we determine which courses and programs have the greatest need for in-person delivery?
How do we accommodate faculty and students who cannot be on campus this fall (health concerns, travel/visa restrictions, personal concerns)?
How do we ensure that we deliver educational programs through all methods that are equitable, accessible and fair?
How do we give our departments and colleges the flexibility to ensure the best academic outcomes in ways that are consistent with our shared governance principles and practices?
How do we ensure our faculty and instructional staff have the flexibility to run their courses and to choose the delivery method that best suits their goals?
How do our instructional and residential decisions impact the community around us?
These plans are still in progress and will continue to be modified and refined after our mid-June decision to reflect any updated directives from Gov. Pritzker and our state and local public health officials.
And if we reach a point later in the summer when we do not believe the conditions we have set out to govern any level of return to on-campus instruction can be met, or if the progression of the virus does not continue to curve downward at a sufficient level, we will not hesitate to make the decision to return entirely to the alternative delivery method that we employed this spring.
I know the uncertainty surrounding such important decisions can be unsettling and frustrating. And while this update may not give you all the answers you would like at this point, I hope you find it helpful and informational to see how we are proceeding with our plans and evaluating the options and considerations that factor into these decisions.

State appropriations for the University of Illinois System would remain at current levels for the coming year under a budget approved over the holiday weekend by the Illinois Legislature that will be sent to Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who is expected to sign it into law.
Like many things amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the proposed $42.8 billion budget is contingent on a number of factors, including how the state rebounds from the crisis and on access to federal relief funding.
The budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 also re-appropriates capital funding to support key construction projects. That includes funding for development of our Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) and Illinois Innovation Network (IIN), along with major projects at each of our universities.
Highlights of the budget include:
An appropriation of $622 million for operations, matching state funding for the current fiscal year.
Re-appropriation of $500 million in capital funding for planning and construction of DPI and 15 IIN research hubs across the state, including one at each of our universities and satellite campuses.
Re-appropriation of $807 million to fund capital improvements at all three universities. Major projects include renovation of Altgeld Hall for a math, statistics and data science collaboration center in Urbana-Champaign; a quantum sciences initiative that Urbana is developing in partnership with the University of Chicago, Argonne and FermiLab; the Advanced Chemical Technical Building at UIC and a computer design research and learning center for UIC’s College of Engineering; and a new facility at UIS that will replace the existing library, along with a new Public Safety Building. 
Appropriation of $7 million in new capital funding to relocate Urbana’s Swine Research Center.
Flat funding that matches the current fiscal year for the Monetary Award Program (MAP), which provides financial aid to support Illinois students. The legislature also provided funding at current levels for the third year of a state scholarship program created to encourage in-state students to attend college in Illinois and stem an outmigration of talent to other states. The U of I System and other universities provide matching funds to double the impact of the state’s contribution.
The U of I System advocated for increased funding to support a flagship university system that has set enrollment records for seven straight years and has played a key role in helping the state navigate the COVID crisis. But we understand the financial challenges the pandemic has created and the shared sacrifice that is required to pave the way to recovery.
We are grateful to Gov. Pritzker, the legislature and our U of I Caucus for their support during this difficult budget process, and to all of you for everything you do to make the U of I System a key engine of progress for the people of Illinois.

                May 21, 2020 3:54 PM

        Dear Faculty and Staff,
We shared in this previous massmail on May 12 that you can expect to hear more details about your unit’s plans and timelines by June 1. As we get closer to that date, I want to share an update on our return to on-campus operations, so you know what to expect.
We will not begin returning until we are confident we can do so safely.
You have likely heard that Gov. J.B. Pritzker has announced his intent to loosen restrictions to the stay-at-home order beginning on May 29. Of course, we will follow the Restore Illinois guidance and the advice we receive from the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. But that is only the beginning of our considerations.
It is imperative to the safety of our entire community that we return to on-campus operations in a gradual, cautious and deliberate fashion.
This is our most important priority, and we are not going to begin this transition of additional employees until we are confident we can do so in a manner that maximizes safety.
You should not plan to return on-campus until your supervisor instructs you to do so, and then only if you do not have unique individual circumstances that make it difficult to transition immediately from working at home.
Information will come from your unit leadership. 
At this point, all deans and other members of the Chancellor’s Senior Leadership Council have prepared plans for how they will implement this transition for their own faculty and staff.
The Executive Steering Committee on Return to On-Campus Operations is reviewing those plans and will provide any feedback by June 1.
Seven teams also have been meeting and working to provide guidance on several critical and overarching issues such as instruction, research, events, testing and human resources.
We have begun sharing guidance on important elements such as mandated face covering standards, necessary signage, equipment needs and cleaning guidelines with facilities managers.
When they are ready, your unit heads will share with you directly how they intend to begin this transition.
The process and timeline likely will be different for different units. That is strategic and recognizes the specific needs and capacity of each unit.
We are committed to serving all employees. 
We recognize that some employees may have unique individual circumstances that make it difficult to transition immediately from working at home.
We encourage you to share those situations with your supervisor as soon as possible, so you can develop a plan together.
You should consider these factors from the CDC when evaluating whether you may be unable to return immediately:
If you or a member of your household fall into one of the categories identified by the CDC as being at high risk for serious complications from the COVID-19 virus; and/or
If schools, day-care centers or day camps are closed or unavailable and you would need to care for a child.

We cannot guarantee all requests will be automatically granted, but we are committed to finding ways to be flexible.
You can expect to hear more from Senior Associate Chancellor for Human Resources Elyne Cole on this issue soon.
It is imperative we coordinate with our local community.
Champaign County has created a list of local businesses that have taken the Champaign County Safe Pledge, a commitment to follow safety standards outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Illinois Department of Public Health and the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District.
You can find the list of businesses at champaigncountysafe.org.
I know this is a complicated and difficult time for us all. Please trust that we have your safety and well-being at the forefront as we are making decisions. Thank you for your patience as we navigate this together.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Faculty and Staff,
As I shared in this May 6 massmail, we have established an extensive, campus-wide planning and implementation framework to ensure a safe, careful and deliberate transition back to on-campus operations. This recovery initiative will be managed by the COVID-19: Executive Steering Committee on Return to On-Campus Operations in collaboration with seven mission-specific working teams that include broad representation from faculty, staff and students from across campus and across disciplines.
I have charged the Executive Steering Committee and the planning teams to work in two phases. The first will be to address the requirements and processes necessary for the opening of the fall semester in whatever configuration it takes. The second phase will address the continuing issues and impacts of COVID-19 into the fall semester and beyond. Of course, we will follow Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s Restore Illinois guidance and the advice we receive from the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. We cannot predict how the next few months will unfold, but we can be ready with contingency plans. These are the committees that have been charged:
Executive Steering Committee (Chair: Senior Associate Chancellor Mike DeLorenzo)View the charge letter and members here.
Academics (Chairs: Vice Provost Bill Bernhard, Vice Provost Kevin Pitts)View the charge letter and members here.
University Life (Chairs: Vice Chancellor Danita Brown Young and Vice Chancellor Sean Garrick)View the charge letter and members here.

Research and Scholarship (Chair: Associate Vice Chancellor Jan Novakofski)View the charge letter and members here.
Shield: Target, Test, Tell (Chair: Associate Dean Martin Burke)View the charge letter and members here.
The Executive Steering Committee and working teams are already establishing the goals, timelines and recommendations for how we will begin the return to on-site work this summer when the stay-at-home order is lifted or relaxed. Our vice chancellors, deans and institute directors have been asked to develop detailed, unit-tailored plans of how and when the faculty and staff in their areas will return to on-site work. We have provided them with tools, campus protocols and processes that have been established. They are working with their respective leadership teams and unit executive officers to customize these plans according to the needs of their faculty and staff. Those customized plans will be submitted to the Executive Steering Committee for review by May 18.
We understand that each unit has unique functional challenges, mission-critical considerations and even significantly differing physical space considerations. We want to ensure as much flexibility as possible, while also providing them with recommended actions, policies and processes. You can expect to hear more details about your unit’s plans and timelines by June 1.
Once again, thank you for your patience and understanding. I am committed to ensuring we return to campus in a manner that allows us to fulfill our missions while ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our community.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

          Dear colleagues:
We are pleased to announce that a program providing additional paid days off during our December/January holidays has been extended to a fifth straight year, reflecting in real terms just how much we appreciate everything you do.
Employees who are eligible for leave benefits will receive three paid gift days for this year’s Reduced Service Days – on December 29, 30 and 31. Combined with holidays, other paid time off and weekends, it will extend the year-end break from Thursday, Dec. 24, through Sunday, Jan. 3. Before the program began in 2016, employees had been required to draw from their annual pool of paid time off to be paid for the three Reduced Service Days.
Our universities, hospital and clinics, and system offices will follow up with more details, including how to report the gift days and how they can be used on different days by essential employees who must work on December 29, 30 or 31.
For employees in union-represented bargaining units, paid time off for the holidays is addressed through the required collective bargaining process.
This has been a year unlike any in our long history. Your extraordinary commitment and hard work have helped us not only cope with the challenges of COVID-19, but write a new chapter in our rich legacy of service to students and the public good. Thank you again for your resiliency, sacrifice and dedication, and we hope the months to come bring a return to normal activities and a joyous holiday season with family and friends.

With the end of the semester nearly upon us, I would like to send my wishes to you for the successful completion of your coursework and projects. I know this can be a stressful time under normal conditions, but the COVID-19 concerns have made it even more stressful. Hang in there and finish strong. Good luck on finals—you’ve got this!
And, as you complete your end-of-the-semester obligations, please be mindful of any Stay at Home orders and requirements for social distancing for your state. If you live in the state of Illinois, the current Stay at Home order and the requirement for social distancing as mandated by Governor JB Pritzker can be found at https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/. The order states, ""Any gathering of more than ten people is prohibited.""
As the weather begins to warm, I know it will be tempting to get outside and socialize. Your health and safety, and that of our entire community, is a top priority of the university. We want to make sure you can stay connected during this time, so please use your university Zoom account (https://illinois.zoom.us) to schedule time to gather virtually with your your friends and family throughout the summer. Please do your part to stop the spread of COVID-19 by practicing social distancing and adhering to all of the safety precautions set forth by the CDC during this pandemic.
I wish you good health and a wonderful summer!

                May 6, 2020 1:47 PM

        Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,
Today, the U.S. Department of Education released new regulations to guide the application of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which protects persons from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance. We are currently reviewing the new regulations to understand the compliance expectations of the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, and we will keep our community informed as we evaluate what will need to be put in place as part of our current Title IX reporting and response processes.
Let us state unequivocally: it is the position of the University of Illinois that sexual misconduct in any form is a direct violation of our institutional values. The new 2020 Title IX regulations are a minimum threshold set by the federal government with which our university must comply. Regulations, however, do not reflect the threshold of our university’s commitment to ensure safe and equitable access to a learning environment free from discrimination based on sex, which includes sexual misconduct.
Our university is committed to work with stakeholders to uphold the following principles and values:
We will continue to be committed to a fair and balanced process for both reporting and responding parties.
We will continue to provide resources and supportive measures for anyone who needs them.
We will continue to provide Confidential Advisors for survivors of sexual misconduct as required by Illinois state law.
We will continue to prioritize the physical and emotional health of our community, as well as provide medical support when it is needed.
We will continue our commitment to sexual misconduct prevention work to create a university culture of consent and respect.
We will continue to provide training for professional staff and administrators on processes and skills to reduce re-traumatization and harm.
We will continue to support and advocate for the rights of LGBTQ students, faculty, and staff.
We will continue to work to implement recommendations from task forces, committees, and exploratory groups.
Federal regulations may change, but our community responsibility to prevent and respond to sexual misconduct extends well beyond rules and mandates. In anticipation of this release, we have engaged at both the university and system levels in a comprehensive review of the November 2018 proposed regulations, advised by campus units and stakeholders with extensive experience and expertise in prevention and response. With this final release, our next steps are to carefully review the new regulations, identify processes that may need to change in consultation with campus experts, and implement the changes. The new regulations will go into effect August 14, 2020.
For more information on reporting sexual misconduct and how to support survivors and any others who need it, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.

                May 6, 2020 1:16 PM

          To our students, faculty, and staff:
Among the Guiding Principles of the University of Illinois System is one that promises: “We will respond expeditiously to discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct, and bullying with policies that are legally appropriate, fair, and widely understood.” This principle is particularly noteworthy today as the U.S. Department of Education issued new regulations regarding the handling of sexual misconduct allegations under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 – changes that will affect all of us as we work to provide safe and welcoming campuses for our more than 100,000 students and employees.
The changes under Title IX are both lengthy and complex, and our attorneys, Title IX officers, and other administrators are reviewing them to gauge their precise impact on all of us.
The new rules include provisions about which we expressed concerns last year when the Department of Education offered the opportunity to comment on proposals being considered. We remain concerned about an overly narrow definition of sexual harassment, a single grievance procedure for both students and employees, and hearing processes that require participants to be subject to cross examination.
As a public university system, we will always comply with Department of Education rules. Almost certainly, though, the new regulations will be subject to litigation that could delay their implementation.
Each of our universities will follow up with more-detailed statements in response to the new regulations. In addition to the U of I System’s review of these regulations, we will continue our ongoing efforts to foster safe learning environments. A system-wide task force recently spent more than a year developing a holistic approach to the prevention of sexual misconduct and fostering a safe, healthy culture for learning and success. Those efforts will continue in partnership with each university.
We thank all of you who have so closely followed this ongoing discussion. Be assured that the U of I System will continue to support our universities as they work toward our collective goal of building campus communities that do not tolerate sexual misconduct, harassment, bullying, or violence in any form.
Sincerely,

We anticipate a formal decision and announcement on fall instruction by the middle of June.

Though we are still under the stay-at-home order from Gov. J.B. Pritzker, we are actively planning protocols we intend to put in place once employees who have been working remotely can begin returning to on-site work.
Deans and other members of the Chancellor’s Senior Leadership Council are preparing detailed plans for how they will implement this transition for their own faculty and staff. These leaders will be working with unit executive officers and others to formulate their respective plans that address their unique functions and are tailored to the specific needs of their faculty, staff and students. 
I have charged a steering committee to lead our COVID-19 recovery planning response, and that committee will be led by Senior Associate Chancellor Mike DeLorenzo. We also have charged several COVID-19 recovery planning response subcommittees in these areas: academics, campus life, community and public engagement, finance and operations, human resources, research and scholarship and testing, tracking and monitoring. We will provide extensive information about each of these committees, their charges and their progress as we move forward. 
On-Site Working
Our transition to on-site operations will be done in a gradual, disciplined manner that is guided by scientific evidence and the safety and well-being of our students, faculty, staff and greater community.
Our goal is to steadily and safely increase our on-site workforce to near full-capacity over the summer to prepare for the new academic year.
The timing and the working arrangements of individual employees will not be the same for everyone. This allows our colleges and departments the necessary flexibility to implement their specific plans within parameters outlined by public health officials.
Gov. Pritzker has ordered that masks be worn in public, so the university will be supplying units with masks for employees who will be working on-site any time before Aug. 16.
Fall Instruction
We have not yet made a decision about the delivery of fall instruction, but we are actively engaged in planning for a number of contingencies.
Our goal is to ensure that we do all we can to maximize our students’ educational experiences.

We recognize that families need time to plan for the fall term.
We anticipate a formal decision and announcement on fall instruction by the middle of June.
I look forward to the day when we can begin the careful process to bring everyone back together in person. It will take each and every one of us to do our fair share to look after the health and well-being of one another. We have done it before and we will do it again.

        Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
We know the sudden transitions in spring instruction caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have come with new challenges and unwelcome stress. In response to many requests from our students and in consultation with the Academic Senate, we are further extending some key deadlines for student course grading and credit decisions.
For full-semester and for second eight-week courses in Spring 2020, the following deadlines have been extended to May 6:
Drop
Elect credit/no credit
Rescind credit/no credit election
Elect the Grade Replacement Policy
Rescind Grade Replacement Policy election
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
For all Spring 2020 full-semester and second eight-week courses, all undergraduate and graduate students now have until May 6 to:
Drop a course by 11:59 p.m. CDT via Student Self-Service.
Elect Credit/No Credit or to rescind their election of Credit/No Credit. Credit/No Credit election and rescinding are done through a student’s college office. See the Credit/No Credit FAQ for a list of college offices. IMPORTANT NOTE: Some colleges require consultation with an advisor or dean to elect or rescind Credit/No Credit; this consultation would need to be completed by the time established by the college office. Be sure to contact your college office to find out specifics.
For all Spring 2020 full-semester and second eight-week courses, all undergraduate students now have until May 6 to:
Elect the Grade Replacement Policy or to rescind election of the Grade Replacement Policy. Contact your college office for information on this policy and how to submit the appropriate form(s).
Students in the following professional programs are excluded from the Spring 2020 academic policy modifications and should consult their college with any questions regarding their spring courses:
Doctor of Veterinary Medicine students in the College of Veterinary Medicine
Students in the College of Law
Students in the Carle Illinois College of Medicine
Further details are available in the Academic Policy Modifications – Spring 2020 on the Office of the Provost’s website.
We hope this additional time to make final grading and credit decisions gives our students more and more options in these final weeks of the semester.
And I ask our faculty and instructional staff continue to exercise creativity, flexibility and compassion in structuring your courses in ways to help your students succeed.
Sincerely,

          Dear colleagues:
I write to inform you that I have created a system-wide coordinating committee to support our universities as they begin planning for the reopening of campuses in the fall and examining the changes that will be required to ensure both safety and excellence.
The committee will help make certain that leaders at our three universities are all benefitting from the best and latest scientific and health information about COVID-19. Each university is also looking at the distinctive issues that are involved in resuming on-campus classes and activities this fall at institutions that differ widely in size and scope.
Transitioning to a “new normal” while retaining our world-class educational experience and protecting the health and safety of our campus communities will be the overriding priority. Included in the coordinating committee’s planning will be issues such as how the pandemic will affect class sizes, residence hall occupancy, large sports or entertainment events, and other traditional campus activities.
The coordinating committee will be co-chaired by Barb Wilson, executive vice president and vice president for academic affairs, and Avijit Ghosh, vice president and chief financial officer. It will include the three provosts from our universities, two vice chancellors overseeing student affairs and research, and a tenured faculty member from the University Senates Conference.
The fall semester may not look exactly the same as when you left our campuses. But I am confident that with the appropriate protocols in place, we will restore much of our face-to-face teaching, as well as lab-based research, residential life and the other unique benefits that make our campus communities second to none. The committee will explore every option to ensure the well-being of students, faculty and staff, including new cutting-edge technologies and devices that are being developed every week as science learns more about the virus.
For now, it is incumbent on all of us to stay the course and continue following Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s new stay-at-home order, which extends through May 30. I am deeply grateful to all of you for everything you have done to keep our operations rolling while also doing your part to slow the virus’ spread. Scientific evidence shows that our collective efforts are working in Illinois and it is now time to plan for our future. 
I look forward to the fall when we can come back together and bring our campuses back to life. In the meantime, thank you again for your sacrifice, understanding and commitment. Take care of yourselves, and each other.
Sincerely,
Tim"

                April 23, 2020 10:01 AM

        Dear Colleagues,
Over the past month, we have achieved a relatively stable COVID-19 operational status as a university, and we are well-positioned to maintain that stability through the end of the semester.
Clearly this pandemic will have significant and lingering economic impacts locally, statewide and nationally. So far, based on projections into this July, the estimated financial COVID-19 costs to our university in terms of additional expenditures, lost revenue and fee adjustments exceed $70 million. And with the pandemic effects expected to linger for months, it is likely all of our traditional funding sources will see negative impacts in the years ahead. We will continue to prioritize efforts to protect the safety and health of our students, faculty and staff and to protect our ability to deliver on our teaching, scholarship and engagement missions. 
COVID-19 has disrupted every aspect of our university operations. But collectively, in the space of weeks, we have come together to navigate a path through this. We will ask for the same collective effort and commitment to proactively manage the financial challenges that the pandemic will set for us.
Our actions during this time have been designed to protect our community, and we continue to steward our resources responsibly. We are continuing to allow hiring under a set of new guiding principles and with some additional review processes. These principles include financial parameters that need to be met. We are closely monitoring the fiscal health of all campus units. And we are focusing resources on financial planning and forecasting. This includes tuition modeling, evaluating multiple state funding scenarios and quantifying revenues that might be lost either temporarily or permanently.
As it has done with so many other aspects of our operations, COVID-19 has introduced new uncertainty into our financial status. But it is most certainly necessary for us to carefully evaluate our current situation, model for a wide range of possible future scenarios and manage our resources with even greater strategy and care.
We have plenty of institutional experience in managing budget challenges. And it was sound fiscal management across the entire university that saw us continue to move forward and upward through those challenges.
As we get more clarity about both short- and long-term economic impacts of the pandemic and as we implement actions to mitigate them, we will share that information with the campus community.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

        Dear Students,
We recognize that the COVID-19 pandemic has created some very challenging circumstances for you. In particular, we understand that the rapid transition to remote instruction along with the Governor’s stay-at-home order have led to additional, unexpected financial challenges. 
To help those of you with financial needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have created, using money from the federal CARES Act, through the University of Illinois System's Students FIRST: COVID-19 Emergency Fund, the Illinois Cares: COVID-19 Support Program. 
You can submit a request for a grant that does not need to be repaid of up to $1,000 to help with financial challenges associated with COVID-19. Students may request above $1,000 but only in cases of extraordinary need, and those requests will require additional documentation. If you lost your off-campus job, have additional medical expenses or have technology needs associated with the pandemic, we have funds that can help you.
The application for this program is here: http://odos.illinois.edu/community-of-care/emergency-dean-fund/.
You will be asked to describe the type of need that you have and the reason you are requesting financial support. Depending upon the situation, we might ask you for additional information or documentation. 
If you are awarded funding, it will come to you in the form of a grant that will be processed through your student account and will be directly refunded to you so that you can use it based upon your need. If you currently have a balance due on your student account, the emergency grant will not be applied towards these charges. 
If you have questions about this program, please contact the Office of Student Financial Aid at finaid@illinois.edu or 217-333-0100.

        Dear Illini,
As we transition into a new phase of education in an online environment, we are all learning to navigate the new challenges that come with learning outside of a traditional classroom setting. One of these new challenges includes preventing and handling disruptions in virtual classrooms, meetings, and events—all of which have been witnessed in the Illini community. These disruptions can often be harmful to those who experience them.
Despite good faith efforts by all members of our community to acclimate to this new digital environment, we are still faced by acts of hate targeted at the most marginalized members of our community. This was particularly present on Monday, March 30th, when a group of individuals invaded a Zoom-based I-Connect workshop and displayed antisemitic imagery alongside shouting of violent antisemitic, racist and misogynistic language at the participants and facilitator staff on the Zoom meeting.
While this incident is a clear example of antisemitism, racism and misogyny, it is unfortunately not the first example of this type of violence exhibited at this University. This incident follows a pattern of acts of hate that have been exhibited in our community that have often gone unacknowledged, both by University administration and by our own Student Government. We recognize, first and foremost, the harms that have been done to members of our community through this inaction, and we seek to prioritize the needs of members of our community who have been targeted by this type of harassment. The Office of Inclusion and Intercultural Relations has released a statement regarding recent Zoombombings as well as actions that have been taken since. You can view the statement here: https://oiir.illinois.edu/news-statements/oiir-statement-regarding-zoombombing.
While it is impossible to undo the pain that incidents like this inflict on those who are targeted, it is our responsibility as student representatives to work to mitigate it as much as possible. We write today with resources that we hope will help you to find community, strength, and comfort during this time.

                April 10, 2020 2:02 PM

        Dear Students,
As we are all well aware, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to sudden and unprecedented disruptions of the university experiences we all expected when the semester began. As a result of this unexpected change, some of the services physically tied to the campus are not available.
In addition to the billing adjustments already in process related to University Housing (including dining), we are making immediate downward adjustments to Student Service and Campus Transportation fees to reflect the loss of access since March 14. This will translate to approximately a 53% reduction to the Service and Campus Transportation fees this semester. These adjustments will be applied to student accounts as soon as possible. Students who have paid full semester costs in advance will see a credit and those paying on installments will see remaining payment amounts reduced accordingly. These adjustments will not affect student financial aid awards.
How Much Will These Adjustments Be?
Charges ended on March 14 for students with a contract for University Housing and/or dining who returned to their permanent homes. Their accounts have been credited accordingly. Residents who choose to remain in University Housing as part of Continued Housing will continue to be charged room and board at rates adjusted for the changes this semester has required. For more information, visit the University Housing website.
Students who were assessed the Service Fee and/or the Campus Transportation Fee will see a 53% adjustment credit to each. The Service Fee credit amount will be $157. The Transportation Fee credit amount will be $33. Many undergraduate and graduate students who received fee waivers for the semester have already had the Service Fee waived.
These credits will be applied to student accounts. You may view the status of your account with the Self Service app. Please allow up to two weeks to see changes reflected.
Some Campus Fees Are Not Being Adjusted, Why Not?
We have several fees that are dedicated to campus infrastructure and maintenance that are not tied to specific services and periods of use. These fees support permanent improvements that serve the entire university community such as classroom renovations, deferred maintenance for student-used facilities, debt service, bike paths and student scholarships.
Student Health Insurance fees cannot be adjusted. The Student Health Insurance covers students while they are on-campus, away from campus and abroad and may be used to protect students during the current pandemic.
Fees related to specific academic programs or courses are not part of this central campus adjustment. Departments and colleges are addressing any adjustments to specific course fees resulting from COVID-19 disruptions separately.
Ensuring our courses continue to deliver the desired learning outcomes has been a priority in the transition to alternative delivery. And as we have communicated previously, there will be no tuition adjustments for the courses that continue this semester.
We fully recognize that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a nationwide conclusion to an academic year no one ever imagined. And we understand that the sudden changes here at Illinois have been stressful and disruptive for every one of our students. We continue to work through the challenges that these sudden changes have created in the way we operate. Thank you for your understanding.

        Dear students,
You may find some of your courses utilizing a tool called Proctorio for online proctoring to help ensure academic integrity of assessments. We are working to ensure that all online tools work well for you and your instructors, and for those of you who may have upcoming assessments utilizing Proctorio, we wanted to provide a few quick tips:
A guide for downloading and using Proctorio can be found at go.illinois.edu/keeplearning .
For any technical problems downloading or using Proctorio, please contact Proctorio support.
Before using Proctorio, you should restart your computer and ensure all possible programs are closed.
Faculty have been made aware that some students may not have webcam access or reliable internet connectivity. They will do their best to provide alternative testing options should you be unable to utilize Proctorio. 
Proctorio has a contract with the university that has been vetted for student privacy protection and data security. For additional privacy protection:
Students can uninstall or disable the Proctorio extension when not in use.
Students should cover any information on their IDs other than their name and photograph.
Thanks for all your diligent work to keep learning during this semester. Stay healthy!

Thanks for looking after the continuity of instruction for our students. Those of you who plan on using Proctorio for proctoring of online assessments should carefully read this email as it contains important updates.
Previous instructor guides for Proctorio and the training workshops conducted last week had incorrect information about how to set-up exams. Students will be unable to take your exam if you used the incorrect instructions. We sincerely apologize for this error and any confusion it may have caused.
If you previously downloaded an instructor guide, please visit and redownload the updated guide at https://ops.citl.illinois.edu/proctorio. Additionally, you can contact Proctorio support (https://proctorio.com/support ) via email or live chat to have them double-check your exam settings.
Please note that we are seeing approximately 5-10% of students who do not have sufficient technology (lack of webcams or too little RAM) or internet access (too unstable or too slow of upload speed) to utilize Proctorio. Please plan on alternative arrangements for such students.
Guidance on technology requirements and more Proctorio tips are available online for faculty and for students.
Thanks for all your diligent work to keep learning during this semester. Stay healthy!

We understand these are challenging times, but we look forward to the day when we can all get together to celebrate being an Illini.
One of those times we hope we can come together is Homecoming 2020, with festivities set to take place from Oct 11-17. To make the week even better, we need your help!
Last year “Always True to Orange and Blue” was the theme that carried us through the week.
Students, faculty, and alumni showed their Illini pride by displaying their school colors at every chance possible. You can help us determine the look and feel of this year’s celebration by submitting your homecoming theme idea, and later voting on the top 5 submissions.
Be creative with your ideas! As an example, we encourage you to think about ways to incorporate iconic or memorable parts of campus (The Quad, Alma, Altgeld Chimes). These could be part of a theme that can then be taken and used in a variety of ways to make Homecoming Week even better!
This survey will take less than 5 minutes and will be open for one week. The top 5 theme submissions will be announced to you via email, for a final vote.
Submit Theme
Here are some examples of previous homecoming themes:
Bleed Orange
Always Illini
Orange Fever

We will announce the winner on the Homecoming website and Illinois Alumni Facebook account May 2020.
We're looking forward to hearing your ideas!

                April 6, 2020 5:32 PM

        Dear Students,
It has been almost three weeks since our last student letter. McKinley remains in full operation for acute and subacute services. The purpose of this update is to provide information on how you can access services whether you are back home or in the local community.
On Saturday, March 21, the Governor’s shelter-in-place order went into effect and has now been extended until April 30. While telehealth and in-person appointments are available, they must be made by calling us at (217) 333-2700. We will provide services via telehealth and consider in-person appointments as needed.
McKinley Health Center staff are working remotely with a small number of staff in the building each day based on the demand for face-to-face visits. Outlined below are updates regarding our services:
Respiratory Issues: McKinley has a dedicated unit for respiratory issues. If you have had an acute respiratory issue within the last 7-14 days, we need to speak with you and schedule an appointment for evaluation and possible testing. Chronic asthma and allergy issues are being handled via telehealth or are being seen in other clinical areas within the health center.
Pharmacy: Speak with your doctor or the pharmacist regarding refills. In many cases, our pharmacist can bring your refill out to your car, so that you do not have to come into the building. Call the pharmacy at (217) 333-2700 in order to coordinate your pickup.
Mental Health: Most of our mental health professionals are providing counseling via telehealth. Our psychiatrists are working both onsite and remotely. Call (217) 333-2700 to schedule these appointments.
Allergy Shots and Vaccines: Routine allergy shots are given in our West 1 Clinic at this time. If you are currently receiving a vaccination series and need the next shot in the series, this service is available as well. We are not initiating other vaccinations at this time.
Medical or Injury-Related Visits: Acute problems are being screened via phone or telehealth and then scheduled as needed in our medical clinics. Chronic disease management (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) is still available. No routine or elective care is being provided.
Women’s Health: Acute needs are being handled via telehealth or face-to-face visits. Follow-up for an abnormal pap smear or other conditions needing follow-up are viewed as essential care. No routine care (e.g., elective physicals, IUD insertions, routine STD screening) is being provided while the current shelter-in-place order is in effect.
Health Education: SportWell, Stress Management, Nutrition, and Sexual Health services are available as needed via telehealth, with limited face-to-face visits.
Lab and X-ray: Both areas are fully operational. When referred by McKinley staff to one of these areas, they will assist you in scheduling services in order to avoid overcrowding. If outside orders or routine labs are needed, please call (217) 333-2700 to schedule a time to come in to these locations.
Many students are at home for the remainder of the semester, but can still contact us as needed, by calling (217) 333-2700. Our telehealth capabilities allow us to continue to offer patient care with the benefits of technology. The university is a leader in technology and this makes us all proud to be an Illini!
You can watch our recent YouTube Video and follow us on YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook for additional updates and wellness information. You can also continue to send questions, thoughts, or recommendations to us at studenthealthcenter@illinois.edu.

        Dear Members of the University Community,
To ensure that we keep our university community and visitors safe during the COVID-19 pandemic and to return to normal business as soon as it is safe to do so, we have made the decision to cancel all university summer camps through July 10, 2020 and all summer events until further notice. We have waited as long as possible to make this decision, and we know it will have impacts on families throughout the state and beyond, as well as businesses that provide support and services to our university community year after year. But the safety and well-being of our Illinois family and our guests is always our number one priority.
Camps
As you know, the state of Illinois is under a stay-at-home directive to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. We do not know when it will be safe to resume in-person activities, and camps require time for planning and logistics, so we cannot wait any longer to make this decision.
We define camps as organized daily or residential recreational, academic or athletic offerings on campus or sponsored by the university, at any location, for young people during summer vacation.
All camps scheduled to begin before July 10 are canceled. (Illinois Extension has made the decision to cancel all summer camps through at least July 31.)
We will make a decision about camps currently scheduled to begin after that date as soon as possible.
Events
We have cancelled all events through the end of the semester, May 16.
We are following State of Illinois guidance on gatherings, so no summer events will be held until the statewide stay-at-home directive expires.
We define summer events as organized activities sponsored by the university and/or held in university facilities that involve gatherings of small to large groups of people. Examples would include conferences, tournaments, weddings and concerts.
Once the stay-at-home directive is lifted, any summer events must comply with social distancing and crowd limits as directed by the governor’s office. When this happens, we will provide more information about summer events protocols.
If you have additional questions about specific camps and programs, please contact either the camp’s organizers or the event’s hosting venue.
Thank you for your continued patience and kindness as we navigate these uncertain times.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

                April 3, 2020 8:29 AM

        Dear Faculty,
Thank you very much for all your efforts the past couple weeks to ensure the continuity of instruction for our students. This email highlights a few important updates and reminders about making remote instruction as reliable as possible.
 Choose the lowest bandwidth option possible
Our students do not all have reliable, high speed internet access. Nationwide, many users are experiencing degraded internet service as networks are struggling to serve increased home internet and streaming usage. Whenever possible, try to use text, audio or video instead of synchronous content. Live Zoom sessions should only be used for office hours or smaller classes that require student interaction. See the Keep Teaching resources page for guides on creating video lectures and information on how to get one-on-one support. Please try to be accommodating if you have students with connectivity issues.
If you are planning on using Proctorio for exam proctoring, we recommend doing a practice test at least a week in advance to allow students to test out their configurations. Internet upload speeds are different than download speeds; students who are used to expedient downloading of course materials may struggle with the Proctorio service, as it is reliant on upload speed.
Check your Zoom security settings
If you are using Zoom, please make sure you have updated the Zoom security settings for your sessions and are aware of how to manage disrupters. The campus is taking Zoom disruption incidents very seriously and trying to make sure our learning environments are not disrupted by explicit content and hate speech. As of March 31, 2020, all newly created Zoom meetings require a password by default. Meeting organizers and course instructors will need to share passwords with attendees ahead of Zoom meetings.
Refer students with access issues to the Student Assistance Center
The campus has sent multiple messages to students regarding available resources for internet access, loaner laptops and webcams. Despite these messages, some students still may not be aware of ways the university can help them access their remote classes. Please refer students in need of such support to the Student Assistance Center by encouraging them to email helpdean@illinois.edu. Student email requests are answered promptly and tracked until the issue is resolved. We have already shipped out dozens of loaner devices to students and assisted many students with connecting to free internet services from major providers.
Again, thank you for all you have done to ensure the continuity  of our campus educational mission in these unprecedented circumstances.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and continued guidance from both local and state health officials, we have made the decision that all Summer 2020 courses will be conducted remotely via alternative delivery mechanisms.
We know that this decision about summer courses may generate additional questions about summer research, programs, travel, housing, events, remote work protocols, etc. We are not ready to make those decisions at this time, but as soon as we are ready, you will be notified.
More details about Summer 2020 courses 
Registration for Summer session begins on April 20, 2020. Additional information regarding dates and deadlines may be found here. The Summer Financial Aid application will be available on the Office of Student Financial Aid website on April 20.
The Office of the Registrar will be contacting departments and academic programs to aid in modifying summer offerings as appropriate. Our priority is to provide as many opportunities as possible for students to continue progression towards their degree. 
Faculty that would like support in preparing their course for remote instruction can contact the Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning (CITL).
As you know, we have already announced that all Summer 2020 Study Abroad programs will be suspended.

So much has been asked of you over the last few weeks in the push to stem the spread of the COVID-19 virus.
Many of you have been uprooted, disrupted and distanced from family, friends and colleagues. You have transitioned into a world that is suddenly more virtual than personal, sacrificing many of the daily rhythms and joys of life.
You have responded with remarkable understanding, compassion and commitment. And at this critical stage in the effort, as Governor Pritzker extends his stay-at-home order through the end of April, please don’t let your guard down.
Experts say the coming weeks could bring the payoff for everything you are doing – a peak in cases that will hopefully shift the tide of the pandemic. So keep staying close to home. Keep up the social distancing. Keep washing your hands and covering coughs and sneezes. Keep watching out for each other. All of our efforts now will help our campus communities, our state and our nation return to the lives we cherish.

        Dear Students,
April 1, 2020 is Census Day, the once-a-decade count of every person living in the United States on that day. With the disruptions in your daily lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic and many of you temporarily living away from Urbana-Champaign, you may be confused about where you should be counted.
The official guidance from the US Census Bureau is that university students affected by the COVID-19 disruptions should still be counted where you lived while at the university. It is important you are counted in the US Census at the address where you would have been living and sleeping most of the time on April 1, 2020, prior to COVID-19 changes.
Here is what you need to know to ensure that you are counted at the correct address in the 2020 Census.
If you are currently living on campus in University Housing, Private Certified Housing or a Fraternity/Sorority House, or lived there before spring break, you will be counted by the university. There is nothing you need to do.
If you are living in an off-campus apartment or house, Ashton Woods, Goodwin-Green, or Orchard Downs—or lived there before spring break—you will need to complete the Census form.
If you are currently living in the Champaign-Urbana area, you should respond to the Census using your current local address where you are living and sleeping most of the time on April 1, 2020.
If you are temporarily living at another location due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but were living in an off-campus apartment or house, Ashton Woods, Goodwin-Green, or Orchard Downs before spring break, you should respond to the Census using the address where you were living and sleeping most of the time before spring break, prior to COVID-19 changes.
For international students attending the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it is important that you also are counted. The US Census is a count of every person living in the United States on April 1, 2020. Please follow the guidance above, regardless of your home country or where you are now currently living after spring break.

2020-03-31T07:14:00Z,2020-03-31,7:14,55558,ISG: Transgender Day of Visibility (3/31) & LGBTQ+ Day of...,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/7570252.html,"-- This message is being sent by the Illinois Student Government LBGBTQ+ Advocacy Task Force through the office of the Illinois Student Government President Connor Josellis. --
Dear Illini,
We are writing to you in the midst of these hard times to highlight two dates which are very significant to the LGBTQ+ population, not only on campus, but worldwide. One being Transgender Day of Visibility on March 31st and the other being LGBTQ+ Day of Silence on April 24th.
We wanted to send you all a reminder of these events to highlight some of the most marginalized communities at the University of Illinois. Even though LGBTQ+ people make up approximately 15.9% of our students, the campus LGBTQ+ community has largely remained unseen.[1] On this campus, LGBTQ+ students in 2019 reported nearly twice as many incidents of gender harassment, cyber harassment, stalking, and dating violence. LGBTQ+ students on campus face more academic disengagement and have higher rates of psychological distress.[1]LGBTQ+ people also face unique struggles due to the fact that many are staying in unaccepting spaces during this quarantine period. Finally, LGBTQ+ students in the UIUC community face more academic disengagement and much higher rates of psychological distress.[1] 
Transgender Day of Visibility serves to celebrate transgender people from around the world and raise awareness about the violence and discrimination that the transgender community faces on a daily basis.[2] 
[Content Warning: discussion of the murders of trans people]
In the United States over 26 trans people were murdered in 2019. The vast majority of these individuals were Black and Hispanic trans women, who tend to experience a greater degree of marginalization. At least 4 trans people were killed so far in 2020. The names of these individuals are: Dustin Parker, Alexa Negrón Luciano, Yampi Méndez Arocho, and lastly Monika Diamond, who was murdered just two weeks ago on March 18th. In all four murders, the trans victims have been deadnamed (called the name assigned to them before their transition), misgendered, and misrepresented by the media. In three of the four murders, the killers have gone unpunished. 
The LGBTQ Day of Silence, organized by GLSEN, is an annual day of action where members of the LGBTQ+ community and their allies take a vow of silence to bring attention to the struggles faced by the community, particularly within academic environments. This silence is meant to represent the silencing that LGBTQ+ students face nearly everyday. At the end of the day, participants are encouraged to “break the silence”, by attending a rally or performing LGBTQ+ activism.
The LGBTQ+ Day of Silence allows us to reflect on what we and those around us are doing to either silence or give voice to the LGBTQ+ community in spaces such as classes, departments, and the university as a whole. 
In light of the cancellation of classes, an alternative to being publicly silent to demonstrate could be to make a social media post encouraging others to read about the history of the Day of Silence or to make a donation to GLSEN, The Trevor Project, or another LGBTQ+ organization. We invite you to share these Day of Silence Speaking Cards, which was created by GLSEN to inform and educate other members of your community about the LGBTQ+ Day of Silence. 
A critical aspect of LGBTQ+ culture is the concept of chosen families. This refers to situations where an LGBTQ+ individual finds many other members of the LGBTQ+ community to rely on for support, validation, and comfort. Many of our LGBTQ+ friends are now facing isolation from these integral support systems. We encourage you to support your classmates and friends through this crisis. We are stronger together.
If you have any questions about ways to support the LGBTQ+ community, we encourage you to reach out the resources listed below:

2020-03-29T15:46:00Z,2020-03-29,15:46,76088,Thank you,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/8834378.html,"Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
Thank you!
That sums up everything else we will say in this note.
Thank you for your patience, your hard work, your creativity and the care you have demonstrated in these intense and difficult times.
In a matter of days, you have stepped up in an exemplary way to allow us to continue to move forward delivering on our missions in a world that feels like it has been turned upside down by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
This has put new demands on every single member of this university family.
Most of you have had to relocate where you work or study and to rethink how you engage with one another.
A number of you have been challenged to find new, safe ways to perform the essential services on our campus that all of us depend upon.
And all of us are doing our best in learning how to live and work together in a time when the health and safety of our communities depends on our personal separation from each other.
We understand how enormously difficult this has been. Operationally, we had a very good first week in these unprecedented times. But as we adjust to these extraordinary circumstances, we also ask that you all take the time you need to think about and address your emotional and mental wellness. We have support resources for students and for our staff and faculty. We encourage you to call upon these resources without hesitation.
We often say that the people who come through this university regularly do things that require the world to redefine “impossible.” You have proven that to be true once again.
At the beginning of this semester, “impossible” is exactly how most would have described what you all, working together, accomplished last week.
Wherever you might be reading this today, we thank you.

2020-03-25T14:40:00Z,2020-03-25,14:40,76072,March 30-31 Reaccreditation Visit,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/1011585.html,"Dear Campus Community,
As many of you know, accreditation is the primary way higher education institutions in the United States are assessed to assure and improve their quality. On March 30-31, 2020, our accreditor, the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), will be evaluating the university through a peer review process that typically includes a campus visit, but now will take place online.
Faculty, staff and students are invited to participate in open meetings that will allow the reviewers to learn more from these respective groups about their experiences at the university.
Faculty Open Meeting: March 30, 4:00pm-4:50pm
Staff Open Meeting: March 31, 1:00pm-1:50pm
Student Open Meeting: March 31, 2:00pm-2:50pm
You can register to attend the meeting by going to the reaccreditation website and clicking the link for the appropriate meeting for the registration information. The reaccreditation website also provides more information about our accreditation and the visit, including:
the list of peer review team members
the university’s assurance argument (self-study document)
summaries of the five criteria along with possible questions
Please know that if you attend a meeting with the peer reviewers, you will be asked questions about the university. To prepare, read the assurance argument. Know that you are not expected to represent the entire university, but instead speak from your own experience.
We have a strong history of accreditation and are confident we will be reaccredited, as we have been every year since 1913. We want to be sure you are aware of this event, its importance to our university and give you a chance to participate. Questions about HLC accreditation may be addressed to provost@illinois.edu.

2020-03-24T13:54:00Z,2020-03-24,13:54,55564,"COVID-19 academic policies: pass/no-pass grading schemes,...",https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/8897866.html,"Dear Students,
In order to ensure the best educational experiences for you, we have implemented some new policies for Spring 2020 full-semester and second eight-week courses. These policies are in effect for both undergraduate and graduate courses. These policies were developed in close consultation with faculty, students, staff and the Academic Senate.
These academic policies will allow you some choices as you navigate this semester. You will be receiving more specific guidance from your instructors and your department in the days to come. You will have plenty of time to make any decisions that might be necessary. But we want you to have this information now as you begin this final half of a very unexpected semester. 
The deadline to drop a full-semester course has been changed to April 30, 2020.
For full-semester and second eight-week courses, you will be given the option to select the “credit/no-credit” (CR/NC) grading option as outlined in the Student Code. The following modifications to the CR/NC grading will be in effect for the Spring 2020 semester only.
You have until April 30, 2020, to elect CR/NC grading.
Courses taken with CR/NC may be used to fulfill major, minor and General Education requirements.
There is no limit on the number of courses selected for CR/NC.

For a small number of courses that must significantly alter their assessment strategy, instructors may request a switch away from standard course grading (A/B/C/D/F) to “pass/no-pass” (PA/NP) grading for their course. This option is only anticipated for courses where the assessment modification makes it difficult to fairly assign letter grades.
If a course is approved for PA/NP grading, all students will be assessed using the same pass/no-pass criteria. There is no option for students to select standard grading.
Your instructor will let you know in the near future if your course is converted to PA/NP grading.

Deadlines for student actions:
The deadline to drop a full semester course (without a W) is now April 30.
The deadline to select CR/NC grading is now April 30 (see above).
The deadline to utilize Campus Grade Replacement option is now April 30. Students who previously selected a course for grade replacement may now retract their prior request.

Other important dates for continuing students:
Time-tickets for Summer 2020 and Fall 2020 registration will be released on April 6.
Registration for Summer 2020 will begin on April 20.
Registration for Fall 2020 will begin on April 20.

Students and courses in professional programs (College of Law, Carle Illinois College of Medicine and the College of Veterinary Medicine) are excluded from these temporary academic policy modifications.
Colleges and departments have agreed to work with those of you who were expecting or require graded courses for career or certification purposes. We promise CR/NC and PA/NP grading will not affect your status as a student at Illinois. 
We are seeing a growing number of our peer institutions implementing similar policies for this semester, and we expect external stakeholders (e.g., graduate schools, employers) to recognize the unique nature of this semester. We are extending these deadlines to give you more time to make informed choices to try to lessen your stress.
If you do not have proper technology equipment to continue your studies remotely, please contact the Student Assistance Center in the Office of the Dean of Students right away. They can work to supply you with internet access, laptops, hardware and anything else you might need.
I know this adjustment to our policies is neither ideal nor is it a course of action we would ever consider in any normal circumstances. But, in this unprecedented time, we believe these actions are the best way to deliver an educational experience that is fair and academically sound.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

These policies were developed in close consultation with faculty, students, staff and the Academic Senate. I have just shared these messages to faculty and students which provide detailed information.

We have been listening actively to the questions, concerns and suggestions you have offered to ensure we can deliver on the educational objectives we promise in ways that are fair to our students and allow you the greatest flexibility.
In response to what you have asked, and in consultation with the Academic Senate, we are implementing the following academic policies for Spring 2020 full-semester and second eight-week courses. These policies will apply to both graduate and undergraduate courses. These policies were developed in close consultation with faculty, students, staff and the Academic Senate. The deadline to drop a full-semester course (without grade of W) has been changed to April 30, 2020.
Students will be given the option to select a “credit/no-credit” (CR/NC) grading option as outlined in the Student Code. The following modifications to the CR/NC grading will be in effect for the Spring 2020 semester only.
Students have until April 30, 2020, to elect CR/NC grading for any course.
Courses taken with CR/NC may be used to fulfill major, minor and General Education requirements.

For a small number of courses that must significantly alter their assessment strategy, instructors may request a switch away from standard course grading (A/B/C/D/F) to “pass/no-pass” (PA/NP) grading for their course. This option is anticipated to be used only for courses where the assessment modification makes it difficult to fairly assign letter grades. We note that the addition of a campus license for Proctorio™ for online exam proctoring should help courses continue with much of their normal assessment strategies.
In the request to make the course PA/NP, the instructor must explain how and why standard course grading is not feasible for their course.
This change must be approved by department head/chair and;
If a course is approved for PA/NP grading, all students will be assessed using the same pass/no-pass criteria. There is no “opt out” for students to select standard grading.
We strongly recommend that multi-section courses be consistent in their application of this grading scheme.
Additional information will be forthcoming on the process to request a course be switched from traditional to pass/no-pass grading.

The grading modifications outlined above are designed to give all of you with instructional responsibilities the maximum flexibility as you navigate this unique and extremely difficult situation. As a reminder, for regularly graded courses, instructors submit grades for all students as normal. For students who have selected CR/NC grading, their letter grade will be converted in Banner to CR (C- and above) or NC (D or below) automatically.
Students and courses in professional programs (College of Law, Carle Illinois College of Medicine and the College of Veterinary Medicine) are excluded from these temporary academic policy modifications.
This semester will be unique in many ways. Our campus units recognize the issues–and will not penalize students–for courses graded as CR/NC or PA/NP. Departmental and college advising offices will work with students to ensure they understand the options, benefits and potential drawbacks of CR/NC grading.
A growing number of our peer institutions are implementing similar policies for this semester, and we expect external stakeholders (e.g., graduate schools, employers) to recognize the unique nature of this semester. However, we cannot guarantee that all will do so. As a consequence, we continue to recommend that instructors and students consider these factors when advising students and when contemplating any changes to your course grading scheme.
You are the experts here. We trust you to do what is best for your students.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

Our hearts and minds are heavy as we think of all of you, your families, your friends, and those affected by this devastating virus. Much has changed in a very short period. The COVID-19 pandemic has many of us feeling our worlds have been turned upside down. Change is always hard, but the necessity to make changes so quickly and amid so much uncertainty has left many feeling overwhelmed. And for some, returning home can be challenging. Many will now have to balance schoolwork and family commitments, while others are sorely missing the support resources they have come to depend on.

With most of the campus buildings locked, departments will not be generating letters and parcels to deliver to other campus locations. A few offices have made special arrangements for critical items to be delivered. If you or your department has a critical need for transportation of campus mail or processing of outgoing US Mail, please contact Campus Mail at printing@illinois.edu and we will make arrangements. Outgoing mail that needs to be metered requires a pink barcode sticker or a CFOAPAL to which the postage can be charged.
While the campus is following Governor Pritzker’s order to stay at home, please do not put campus mail that you need delivered in any campus mailboxes except the one outside the Turner Student Services Building located at 610 E John St, Champaign. We will be checking this box on Tuesdays and Thursdays and delivering only to buildings that are open.
As a reminder, Campus Mail handles only intracampus mail and outgoing US mail that needs to be metered. The United States Postal Service (USPS) handles all incoming and stamped outgoing US mail. For US mail, the United States Postal Service (USPS) carriers will deliver mail to offices that are accessible. If you wish to forward or stop your US mail, you will need to contact USPS at 800-275-8777 or usps.com.
Campus Mail does not control deliveries that are made by commercial shippers. If you are expecting deliveries from or need to ship items with UPS, FedEx, or other commercial carriers, you should contact them directly to make arrangements; UPS can be contacted through ups.com and FedEx can be contacted through fedex.com.

As we begin the final weeks of a semester disrupted by this unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, I want to share this short video message with all of you. 
I do not pretend that things will be easy.
The classes you have designed or chosen to take will be delivered in alternative ways. Your research and scholarly work may be disrupted, as you develop new and creative ways to move your project forward. In some cases, you might be performing essential duties that can only be done on campus, while others are working remotely. And for the foreseeable future this university will be a place where almost all of our faculty, staff and students are separated by unexpected distance. This is a distance that we will overcome through our shared compassion for each other.
The weeks to come will bring all of us challenges of many different kinds whether academic, professional or personal. I encourage you to look for support when you need it. And I encourage you to lend your support to friends or coworkers or even complete strangers when you see that they need it.
I am confident that when we have come through this, we will look back and see the resiliency of our university community was exceeded only by our care for one another when it mattered most.
Wherever you might be today, you are always a member of the Illinois family.

2020-03-21T17:21:00Z,2020-03-21,17:21,8493,Guidance to Define Critical and Essential Research,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/5295343.html,"Dear Colleagues:
As you are undoubtedly aware, late yesterday the Governor issued an executive order for all individuals living in Illinois to stay at home, effective at 5 p.m. today. The order included an exemption for educational institutions performing “critical research,” provided that social distancing of six feet per person is maintained to the greatest extent possible.
Over the past several weeks, as COVID-19 has escalated across the globe, we have been preparing contingency plans across campus and in the field to ramp-down/shut-down non-essential research activities, in consultation with unit executive officers and facility managers of research infrastructure and equipment. Because of this contingency planning, many of our research investigators have already elected to work remotely and to ramp-down or shut-down non-essential activities on site, particularly when they felt that they could not maintain safe social distancing (6 feet) in their research environments.
Effective immediately, Saturday, March 21, per the Governor’s order and in compliance with campus guidance from the Chancellor and Provost, all research activities on campus, in the field, and at auxiliary sites must now ramp down to conduct only essential activities. This means that most campus research labs, facilities, and field sites should cease in-person operations—safely— with consideration during ramp-down of requirements to effectively ramp back up to resume activities when allowed.
Research and scholarly activities that can be continued remotely are strongly encouraged.
With the requirement that effective social distancing (6 ft) can be maintained, essential research-related activities that require campus and field sites are defined as follows: 
Work that directly relates to preventing, containing, or treating the COVID-19 pandemic
Work that is directly related to national security
Research support functions that are required by law
Work to maintain critical equipment, whether in stand-by mode or operational
Work to maintain critical biological or material samples and animal populations
Seasonally dependent agricultural research with critical implications for human and animal health, as well as food security
Laboratory or field work where discontinuation would result in loss of significant data and samples
Longitudinal or seasonal work where discontinuation would result in loss of significant data and samples
Experiments, projects, and studies that do not fit these categories must ramp down immediately and cease. Executive Officers in your unit, school, institute, and college should be consulted for clarifications that are discipline-specific. If further clarification is required, then Institute Directors or Associate Deans of Research can direct inquiries to ovcr@illinois.edu.
Research personnel and their supervisors who are expected to carry out essential research activities should refer to guidance that was issued on Friday, March 20. 
Remote research and scholarly activities are strongly encouraged. Many research and scholarly activities can be continued remotely and should be supported by regular electronic and virtual contact with research groups. Alternate approaches for research personnel working remotely might include data analysis, preparation and review, presentation preparation, proposal development, and grant report preparation. Do not, however, remove university chemicals, equipment, or animals in an attempt to recreate your labs at off-site locations. Research personnel should not use office spaces on campus for activities that may be conducted remotely.
Next Steps for Principal Investigators and Research Personnel:
Immediately: Determine if any of your lab or field activities meet the definition of essential.
For Supervisors: Specifically inform members of your research teams if they are considered essential. As per guidance from the Chancellor and Provost, unit heads of each department that has essential employees who are required to report to a campus or field location must download this spreadsheet template, name the file UNIT/ESSENTIALPERSONNEL/DATE, fill it out and email to ihr@illinois.edu by Wednesday, March 25. 
Use the DRS ramp-down checklist to shut down your non-essential research operations, so that they may be effectively resumed when allowed.
Access to lab, facilities, and field sites will be available only for personnel who conduct essential related activities or are ramping down to shut-down non-essential research operations.
Essential work should be staggered so that minimal personnel are present in the research environment at any one time. Social distancing of at least six feet should be maintained.
Maintain contact information for your students, postdocs, and staff, and review contingency plans and emergency procedures within your group.
OVCRI offices that support research have remote-work plans in place and remain operational. Please know that the OVCRI stands by to support your research activities during these unprecedented times. Your patience, cooperation, flexibility, and dedication are appreciated as we work together through the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) today announced two separate confirmed cases of COVID-19 in our university community. Both individuals are employees. The first was last on campus on March 13. That individual was tested on March 15, received medical treatment and has been in self-quarantine at home since that time. CUPHD has traced the activities of the individual prior to the self-quarantine and contacted the students, employees and community members who may have been in close proximity to the individual. But in this case, the CUPHD believes the risk of transmission is very low. The second employee was tested on March 18. In this case, CUPHD reports this individual has not had any contact with others, is in self-quarantine and the risk of transmission is very low. Federal health privacy laws prevent us from sharing any other information about individuals who have tested positive. 
We are told both individuals are recovering at home and our thoughts are with them at this time.
These are the first confirmed cases on campus involving members of the university community, and we thought it was important to share this information today. Additionally, an Illini Alert will be sent on this issue in compliance with Clery Act federal reporting regulations. CUPHD has told us to expect more confirmed cases in the days and weeks to come. Going forward, we will make updates about future cases directly to covid19.illinois.edu, and CUPHD will directly contact any individuals who might have been at risk of exposure by being in the immediate area of newly diagnosed people.
Please continue to check covid19.illinois.edu regularly for current information and resources.   
We continue to follow the guidance from public health experts and state officials to take steps to reduce the density of our campus population to allow for greater social distancing and to make the environment safer for those who remain here. Our transition to alternative course delivery will begin on Monday and a large majority of our employees have already transitioned to working remotely. We are working with unit leadership to make any necessary arrangements to comply with Gov. Pritzker’s Stay At Home order for essential employees.  
These are our first confirmed cases with a campus connection. With the rapid spread of COVID-19 and rise in reported cases around our state and nation, this is not an unexpected event. But that does not make today’s announcement any less upsetting. And based on predictions by public health officials, we are likely to see more cases among our campus and local community.
We will keep you informed of new information as we learn of it. And we will continue to do all we can to keep our students, faculty, staff and community members as safe as possible.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"
2020-03-20T17:12:00Z,2020-03-20,17:12,76071,COVID-19: Today's Stay-at-Home Order for Illinois Residents,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/1741338.html,"Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
As you likely have heard, Governor Pritzker today issued a stay-at-home order for Illinois residents and a corresponding University System-wide massmail was sent.
It is important to note that the governor’s order allows universities to continue essential functions, including “facilitating distance learning, performing critical research, or performing essential functions, provided that social distancing of six-feet per person is maintained to the greatest extent possible.”
We want to follow up with some more specific information for our students, faculty and staff about how today’s shelter-in-place order will impact our operations.
For students and families who are moving out of University Housing and are making plans for your check-out, the shelter-in-place order means that we need to suspend that process starting Saturday, March 21 at 2 p.m. until the order is lifted. Housing will reach out to you to provide information on the resumption of move-out.
For all students, graduate and undergraduate, as well as others who will be remaining in University Housing residence halls or apartments or in private residences locally, nothing has changed. We ask you to follow the social distancing guidelines in place now and to plan to begin your coursework through alternative delivery Monday morning.
For all faculty and staff and graduate employees (TAs, RAs, GAs) please continue to follow the guidance about your working arrangements you have already received through Illinois Human Resources, your colleges and your departments, including guidance on whether you will be able to use university classrooms and facilities to present your course material. We are working to put in place new emergency procedures and policies regarding university pay and benefits to comply with the governor’s order and to protect all of our employees.
We know for many that this is another unsettling development. But we are working together to navigate it.
Thank you all for your contributions to ensuring that we can continue to fulfill our missions of learning, discovery and engagement, and thank you for your patience and all of your efforts to approach this crisis with calm and with respect and care for each other.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

Dear faculty, staff and students:
Today, Gov. J.B. Pritzker issued a stay-at-home order for residents of Illinois, part of the state’s ongoing efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19. The order will be in effect through April 7 to keep people home as much as possible and minimize the person-to-person contact that has fueled the global pandemic.
Because of actions we have taken to date, the governor’s order is very consistent with what we are already doing. Faculty and students are transitioning to online and alternative learning mechanisms for the rest of the semester and many of our employees are already working remotely. It has been a herculean effort and we are grateful to all members of our campus communities who have worked so hard to enact such a swift changeover.  
Going forward, we will add the following to comply with the new order:
Employees will work remotely other than those in essential jobs defined in the order, such as police, healthcare workers, power plant operators, and housing and dining personnel. Employees who have specific questions about whether this announcement changes their current working arrangement should ask their supervisor.
Unless in essential jobs, faculty and staff should stay at home except when pursuing essential activities related to healthcare, pharmacy and grocery shopping, gas stations, banking, drive-through and carry-out restaurants, and home-based care for children and seniors.
Students, we are here for you and we are so proud of you! Please help us prevent transmission by staying in your residence halls, apartments, and permanent homes as much as possible while we clamp down on this virus. And use the technologies that you are so good at to stay connected to our universities.
Now, let’s keep showing the way. Our healthcare professionals at UIC and across the state are on the front lines, caring for patients while addressing the epidemic. Faculty across our three universities are sharing their expertise with the Governor’s Office, including an Urbana-Champaign epidemiological study that demonstrates how heightened social distancing can slow the outbreak and prevent a shortage of intensive-care unit beds across the state. In fact, Gov. Pritzker has praised the U of I System’s contributions, which also include providing up-to-date research on the control of infectious diseases, emergency preparedness and public health.
All of you share the credit. Thank you for your concern and compassion for each other and for embracing our collective responsibility to curb the spread of the virus across this state that we are so proud to serve.

2020-03-20T14:20:00Z,2020-03-20,14:20,8493,COVID 19 Guidance for Research Personnel and their...,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/801539.html,"Dear Colleague:
The COVID 19 pandemic has broadly impacted all sectors of our society, including the research, discovery, innovation, and scholarly activities that are one of the mission cornerstones of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. We know that our scholars are faced with continuing their research activities under disrupted circumstances, while embracing creative approaches. The following guidance for implementation of social distancing and remote work is aimed at reducing the density of the campus population and lowering the risk of exposure to those who remain engaged in research in our facilities, laboratories, and field sites.
Guidance for supervisors and advisors of research personnel, including post-docs, technicians, and graduate students. It is a challenging period for all of our employees and students. UIUC currently remains open for research requiring infrastructure that is only accessible on campus or in the field. It is essential that best practices be followed by researchers who continue to work in their usual environment. This includes staying home if one is not feeling well or if a person in your home is not feeling well; adhering to social distancing (6 feet) while in research labs, core facilities, agricultural plots and buildings, and/or in the field; as well as following CDC guidelines to regularly disinfect work spaces. (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/cleaning-disinfection.html) 
Some of the members of your research group are very likely to feel anxiety about coming to work for many reasons. It is critical that you have a private conversation with each of your researchers to identify those who are concerned and encourage them to stay home and work remotely. In these cases, please work as appropriate to develop alternate work activities if they are unable to access essential infrastructure for their normal scope of work.  
Employees might also experience significant anxiety if they cannot access critical facilities to carry out their research project and activities. Again, this might be for many reasons, including pending dissertation deadlines, critical longitudinal timelines, seasonal—dependent research, etc. It is very important that you identify each individual’s concerns and determine whether and how they may be mitigated by revising work plans and developing new timelines.
Guidance for research personnel, including post-docs, technicians, and graduate students. It is a challenging period for researchers as they face projects that might be encumbered with significant expectations, timelines and/or deadlines, while adapting to the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic. If you are continuing to work in your normal university work environment, it is essential that you follow best practices for the safety of yourselves and your co-workers. These include staying home if you are not feeling well or if a person in your home is not feeling well; adhering to social distancing (6 feet) while in research labs, core facilities, agricultural plots and buildings, and/or in the field; and following CDC guidelines to regular disinfect work spaces. (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/cleaning-disinfection.html) 
It is critical to understand that if you are uncomfortable, for any reason, working in your normal work environment—whether it is in a research facility, wet lab, or in the field—that you have the right to work from home. For those whose research activities do not readily adapt to working from home, your advisor/supervisor will assist you to define alternate activities and/or assignments that can be carried out remotely. Alternate assignments will be assigned without adverse academic, employment, or financial consequences. In the case that you cannot reach a satisfactory agreement with your supervisor, please contact as a first step:
Head or Chair of your Department
Director of your interdisciplinary institute
Director of Graduate Studies (DGS) of your Department
Alternative contacts would include the Associate Dean of Research or Academic Affairs in your College, Alexis Thompson (athmpsn1@illinois.edu) in the Graduate College, or Sue Key (susankey@illinois.edu; Human Resources) in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation.
We know that the COVID-19 pandemic and all the circumstances surrounding it are disruptive.
Rapidly evolving information and impact coupled with real time decision-making at the local, state, national, and global levels are stressful for every person at our university.
It is an incredibly unsettling time, and more questions will undoubtedly arise. We will provide answers and details as directly, transparently, and quickly as we can.
We understand that we are asking all of you to help us face a challenge of a scale and magnitude that has rarely before been seen here at our university and are grateful for your flexibility and patience.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost

We are very disappointed to share the news that commencement ceremonies will not take place as scheduled in May at our universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Diplomas will be mailed, and we are exploring possible alternatives such as rescheduling and/or hosting virtual events to honor the Class of 2020. You will hear more from leadership of your universities in the days and weeks to come.
This was an outcome we had hoped to avoid. Commencements reflect the very core of our mission and provide a richly deserved celebration for both our graduates and the proud parents, family, friends, faculty and staff who supported them along the way. Every year, ceremonies across the U of I System draw anywhere from a few hundred people at school- and college-based commencements to more than 20,000 at Urbana’s university-wide event.
Even small turnouts, however, would far exceed the guidance issued last weekend by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to slow the spread of the virus. The new guidelines call for canceling or postponing all large gatherings for at least the next eight weeks – a timeline that brings us within days of our May commencements.
We know you share the goal of those restrictions – protecting yourselves and the well-being of your family, friends and the broader community, particularly the most vulnerable among us. We are proud of your sacrifice and your success, Class of 2020, and we promise we will find ways to honor your achievements.

Earlier today you received a message from Chancellor Robert Jones announcing that we are suspending face-to-face instruction for the rest of the semester. This message provides additional information about this transition; please read it carefully. We know this announcement generated many questions. Thank you for your patience as we worked through details of how to make this extraordinarily difficult transition as smooth as possible under the circumstances. Please continue to read your email regularly.
First and foremost, your health, safety and wellness are the absolute highest priority. Please understand that the current situation is unprecedented, university faculty and staff are working hard to ensure your safety, and we are doing all that we can to support continuity of academic instruction. We will do our best to be flexible and accommodating.
Below are some specific details about our transition away from face-to-face instruction:
Face-to-face instruction is suspended beginning March 23 through the end of the spring 2020 semester.
Campus will remain open. However, many physical services on the campus and throughout the community will be limited in operations. So, we are instructing any students who can safely return to their permanent home for the rest of the semester do so. 
We understand that some students will have the need to return to campus and they may do so.
At this time, we plan for essential campus academic facilities (library, computer labs, etc…) to remain open, in some cases on a limited basis, to provide students with options to access online course materials.
We are following the advice of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public health officials to reduce the density of the population in our facilities and make the environment safer for those who must remain on campus.
If you do not have access to technology that will allow you to engage in remote instruction, please contact the Student Assistant Center in the Office of the Dean of Students.
If you have specific questions or concerns about technology, please contact Technology Services for assistance with technology-specific questions.

You will continue to receive updates from the campus, your home college and your instructors through your campus email address. It is essential that you regularly check this account and read important updates from different campus units.
Instructors are working to move face-to-face courses to alternative delivery methods.
Full-semester courses will continue through alternative delivery starting March 23.
For each class in which you are enrolled, you will receive an email from your instructor before the class is scheduled to meet again. This email will give you information about how the course will be administered going forward.
There will be no additional charges or fees associated with alternative delivery modes.
Full-semester courses that were already offered via fully online delivery will continue as planned.

Second eight-week (part of term B) courses will begin following the schedule as established in the Class Schedule starting March 23.
We are adding additional second eight-week courses as well as additional seats to existing courses.
The deadline to add a second eight-week course is March 27.

If your instructor needs additional time to transition to an alternative delivery method, you will receive a message informing you of any specific class cancellation.
As noted in a previous message, the drop deadline for full-semester courses has been extended to Friday, March 27.
If you have questions or concerns about any of your current classes, about the possibility of adding a second eight-week course or how any of this impacts your academic standing and progress toward a degree, please contact the undergraduate office in your home college.
Finally, please continue to visit covid19.illinois.edu for the most up-to-date and comprehensive information.
We understand that our semester has taken a trajectory that is quite different than we were all expecting.  We know that every question or concern will not be resolved immediately. But our entire faculty and staff are working hard to ensure that you are safe and that your education can continue.  Thanks for your patience and understanding.
Please remain safe and practice social distancing. It helps to protect yourself and your community.

We have decided to suspend face-to-face instruction for the rest of the spring 2020 semester. This is following the advice of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public health officials to reduce the density of the population in our facilities and make the environment safer for those who must remain on campus. We still intend to resume instruction using these new delivery methods beginning Monday, March 23. However, individual instructors who need a bit more time to transition are, as always, authorized to cancel an individual class.
The suspension of face-to-face instruction for the remainder of the semester allows students to make solid plans to remain away from campus for the rest of the term. And it provides our faculty and instructional staff more clarity as we ask so many of you to redesign your course delivery under extraordinarily difficult circumstances.
We know this situation is stressful and unsettling for our students, staff and faculty. As you work to utilize alternative forms of delivery for your course materials, we urge you to be mindful of the challenges our students will face as they attempt to complete the semester through remote instruction. Instructors might find information provided here helpful in your migration from face-to-face delivery.
We are also working with our colleges to identify and remove administrative or logistical barriers to make it easier for our faculty and instructional staff to adjust their course-delivery practices in ways that will help our students engage and succeed. We want to give instructors the resources and flexibility to provide the outstanding educational experience Illinois promises our students. And we want to find ways to make it easy to put fairness and compassion into evaluative decisions. 
We are working through academic policy details associated with the transition away from face-to-face instruction. We will be consulting with the Academic Senate and communicating with instructional faculty and staff as these policies are finalized. 
Thanks for your work to ensure our students have continuity in their academic experience. We understand that the quickly evolving situation is challenging for everyone. The health and wellness of our campus community remains our highest priority.
We know we are asking you to take on an enormous additional responsibility to continue providing the certainty of a world-class education while everything else seems to be changing daily. I am confident that our students are in the very best hands possible.

We are taking steps to follow current guidance by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public health officials related to the practice of social distancing to slow the spread of COVID-19 disease. We are implementing significant new actions to maintain academic operations while reducing the density of the population in our facilities to make the environment safer for those who must remain on campus.
We are suspending face-to-face instruction for the rest of the spring 2020 semester.
We still intend to resume instruction using alternative delivery methods beginning Monday, March 23. Faculty and students will receive separate e-mail messages from Provost Andreas Cangellaris with more details about the transition. These updates also will be posted to the university's COVID-19 website.
We are requiring all students who can safely do so return to their permanent home address to take their classes for the rest of the semester. University Housing is asking those students living in residence halls, Private Certified and Greek housing to begin making plans to move out.
Students with housing contracts will receive an e-mail message with details about this process and scheduling information directly from Vice Chancellor Danita Brown Young.
Students residing in Private Certified Housing (i.e. Bromley, Newman, Illini Tower, Stratford House etc.) and in Greek Houses should consult with their respective facility management to determine policies and processes for move-out.
Information regarding Commencement and other year-end celebrations will be shared at a later time. All other campus events for this semester, including those sponsored by student organizations, are cancelled.
These actions will be unsettling to many and generate new questions. As noted above, we will provide answers and details as directly and as quickly as we can. But we believe these actions will reduce the density of the campus population and reduce the risk of exposure to those who remain here.
But, there are two points I hope everyone takes away clearly from this message:
We are not closing our residence halls. But we are asking all students who can go elsewhere, do so. For those who cannot leave, we will work with you to ensure you will have a safe and supportive home here as you continue your studies.
The university is not closing down nor ceasing operations. We plan for our modified operations to continue as announced through various messages in the past few days. Alternative instruction will continue as scheduled, as will the delivery of university operations designated as essential by college and unit executives. Students, staff and faculty should continue to attend class, teach and work as scheduled. University research offices remain open and we have plans in place to minimize disruptions to the research enterprise. 
I know this is disruptive and the constantly changing local, state, national and global situation is stressful for every person at this university.
I understand that we are asking all of you to help us face a challenge of a scale and magnitude that has rarely before been seen here at our university.
I cannot tell you when we will come out on the other side of this outbreak. And there may be new changes or new announcements in response to changing circumstances in the days to come.
But I can promise you that we will communicate as openly, honestly and quickly as we can.
And I can most certainly express my enormous gratitude to every single member of this university and this community for your exceptional efforts in these extraordinary days.

The campus recognizes the critical role that graduate students play in the function of a research university.  Graduate students participate in research, teaching, and scholarship. We are taking measures to support them in each of these areas.  Below we provide some guidance pertaining to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on graduate education, graduate employment, and the general health and wellbeing of graduate students.
Graduate Education:
Traditional classroom-based courses: Many graduate students are currently enrolled in traditional classroom-based courses. The campus will be suspending face-to-face course instruction after Spring Break. Face-to-face courses will be cancelled beginning March 23. Beginning as soon as possible after that date, most courses will be taught via alternative delivery approaches. Course instructors are responsible for contacting enrolled graduate students with instructions for how each course will be delivered. Information should be provided to students in need of special accommodations. Students who need accommodations or assistance with this transition should contact Disability Resources and Educational Services at +1-217-333-4603.
Dissertation and thesis research and related independent study courses: Many graduate students work closely with faculty on a variety of research-based academic experiences such as Independent Study, Thesis, and Dissertation Research.  Campus is not closed. Faculty, graduate students and staff may still come to campus as usual.  It is our expectation that graduate students will continue to work with their advisor on these projects.  Graduate students should be encouraged to contact their advisor or their department for additional advice regarding how to best continue to make progress in these educational experiences. 
Internships and Clinical Rotations: Students who are in the process of completing assigned internships or clinical rotations should contact their advisor or supervisor to discuss how to best continue to make progress in these educational experiences. 
Administration of qualifying exams, thesis defenses, and doctoral preliminary and final examinations:  Many graduate students are currently preparing to take qualifying, preliminary or final dissertation or thesis examinations.  These examinations are an extremely important component of the student's academic program and should proceed as planned if at all possible.   In recognition of the fact that some committee members and graduate students may not be able to attend these examinations in person, the Graduate College is relaxing the regulations pertaining to the conduct of these examinations.  Specifically, effective immediately, the Graduate College will allow preliminary and final examinations to take place fully online by temporarily waiving current policy requirements that at least the chair and one additional member participate on campus. Students who are planning to take these examinations in the near future are encouraged to reach out to their advisor and department for additional information.
Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Hourly Employees:
Graduate students are extremely valued members of our community and our university would not be able to function without their hard work and contributions.  It is our intention to continue to rely on the services provided by graduate students during the current situation.  Graduate students with appointments will continue to be paid and will remain eligible for any tuition waiver associated with their appointment. Below we provide some additional information pertaining to teaching assistants, research assistants, other graduate assistants, fellows, and hourly employees.
Teaching Assistants: The university is transitioning to online and alternative course delivery for traditional classroom-based courses. If a student is assigned to assist a faculty member as a TA or grader they will be expected to continue to assist with the course or courses to which they have been assigned.  TAs should contact the faculty member responsible for the course to which they have been assigned or their department for specific instructions for their assignment.  If a graduate student is assigned as the instructor of record for a course, the student should be contacted by the department or college with respect to providing advice about how best to ensure appropriate instructional continuity.
Research Assistants: Graduate students who are employed as research assistants will continue to work on the projects to which they have been assigned.  We recognize that due to the fluid and changing nature of the current situation, specific duties and responsibilities may change.  Research assistants are encouraged to reach out to their supervisor for additional instructions pertaining to their assignment.
Other Graduate Assistants: Many graduate students are assigned graduate assistantship responsibilities to support departmental, college, or central campus units in an administrative or service capacity. Graduate students will continue to work on the projects to which they have been assigned.  We recognize that due to the fluid and changing nature of the current situation, specific duties and responsibilities may change.  Graduate assistants are encouraged to reach out to their supervisor for additional instructions pertaining to their assignment.Fellows: Fellows will continue to receive monthly stipends in accordance with the terms of their fellowship.
Hourly Employees: Hourly employees are encouraged to check with their employing unit about any new arrangements moving forward.
Graduate Student Health and Wellbeing:
We know the uncertainty of this situation is challenging for everyone in different ways. Our goal is that our graduate students will be able to focus on their studies, their work, their wellness and their lives. We will provide them with the support and resources they need to enable this to happen.
Health and Wellness: The health and safety of our community is of paramount importance.  We recognize that in the coming weeks and months members of our community may become unwell and will not be able to come to the university.  The university has posted detailed guidance about how to respond to health challenges and how to seek assistance.  Graduate students are encouraged to reach out to their department or the Graduate College if they are in need of support or if they are unsure of what to do.  Additional information is available online at the Graduate College Need Help webpage and on the campus and Graduate College COVID-19 webpages.
Coping with Anxiety and Stress: The Counseling Center provides services to help students address many academic, relational, social, and emotional concerns. Students in need of services should be encouraged to contact the Counseling Center to make an appointment. The Mental Health Clinic at McKinley Health Center offers a variety of services to students seeking assistance with stress, including educational resources for strategies and relaxation techniques.
University-Sponsored Travel: The university is prohibiting all international travel on university-sponsored business including conferences for faculty, staff and students from March 16 until further notice. The university is limiting domestic travel for faculty, staff and students to pre-approved travel for essential university business including conferences. The university will offer assistance to address academic and financial issues and other challenges that might arise from this decision. Those who believe they have an essential business reason to travel can request a waiver through their unit leader (dean, vice provost, vice chancellor, etc.), but the expectation is such waivers will be rare. 
Research or Study Abroad: The university has cancelled all international Study Abroad for all students from March 14 to at least August 15. Students are encouraged to return to the United States or to their home country. The university will offer assistance to address academic and financial issues and other challenges that might arise from this decision. Study abroad educational experiences are life-long and life-changing; however, our top priority at this time is to ensure our students’ personal health and safety while ensuring they can continue to make academic progress.
Graduate students who are conducting research abroad are encouraged to return to the United States or to their home country. The university will offer assistance to address academic and financial issues and other challenges that might arise from this decision. Graduate students are encouraged to reach out to their faculty advisors.  Those who believe they have an essential reason to remain abroad can request a waiver through their unit leader (dean, vice provost, vice chancellor, etc.), but the expectation is such waivers will be rare.
Personal Travel: The university is strongly advising against all international and domestic air travel on personal business for faculty, staff and students, especially those with underlying health conditions. Anyone who travels to a CDC Level 2 or 3 region, whether for professional or personal reasons, will be required to self-quarantine off-campus for 14 days BEFORE returning to campus. More information about the Self-Quarantine Protocol can be found online.
University Sponsored Events and Meetings: The university is suspending all university-sponsored, in-person events and meetings in campus facilities, effective March 13. More specifically, gatherings of 50 or more attendees should be postponed or cancelled. Instead, if possible and as appropriate, organizers should explore alternative ways of conducting the event, e.g., livestreaming and conference calling.  The university recommends that all in-person meetings be moved to an alternative solution unless meeting in-person is essential to do so. If so, please observe CDC guidelines on social distancing and other preventative measures.
International Students: The university recognizes that this is a stressful time for our international students and that there is much uncertainty regarding travel at this point in time. The Office of International Student and Scholar Services is able to provide additional information and updates which are  posted on the International Student and Scholar Services website and the university’s COVID-19 webpage.

As of 2:30 p.m. Sunday, March 15, 2020, Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) has announced there is a confirmed case of the COVID-19 disease in Champaign County. The individual is not a student, staff or faculty member. CUPHD has traced the recent activities of the individual and does not believe there is any link to being in a university facility or attending a university event. The individual is in self-quarantine under the supervision of CUPHD and those who may have been exposed have been contacted.
CUPHD will be holding a public news conference today at 3 p.m. that will be live-streamed from the district’s Facebook page and they anticipate local broadcast outlets will also carry the event.
CUPHD tells us the risk of transmission for the general community is considered to be low from this case. However, they have also said there are at least 50 additional tests pending and they expect to see more cases confirmed in the coming days.
If we learn of new information about the outbreak that would have more direct impact on our students, faculty, staff or operations, we will share this as soon as we can. Please continue to check covid19.illinois.edu regularly for current information and resources.

As we continue to address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the safety and wellbeing of our students, faculty and staff is our top priority. As we said when we announced the transition from face-to-face instruction, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises that everyone follow social distancing practices. We want to make sure you are aware that some university employees will be working remotely to ensure that those who need to be physically on campus will be able to avoid contact with others as much as possible. If you are a student employee, your supervisor will provide guidance to you.
I want to be clear, though, that does not mean faculty and staff will not be working. We will continue to provide support to you throughout this situation, and we will be available to assist you with services such as career counseling, mental health, financial aid questions and any other concerns you have. Please be advised that some services may be limited during this time. We strongly recommend calling or emailing the office or department before visiting. [https://directory.illinois.edu/departmentsUnits]
We understand this is a time of uncertainty, and we are doing everything possible to reduce the anxiety the situation is creating. We want you to be able to focus on your studies and your life.
Thank you for your patience as we transition to this new reality, and please remember that although we cannot all be together, we are still a community and showing kindness and compassion to each other will be the hallmark of our response to this outbreak.
Sincerely,
Dr. Danita M. B. YoungVice Chancellor for Student Affairs"
2020-03-14T22:12:00Z,2020-03-14,22:12,30080,COVID-19: Remote work information,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/2064109.html,"Dear Faculty and Staff,
Earlier, we shared the following message with deans, directors and department heads. We want to share it with you as well, so everyone is clear on our remote work policy for addressing the challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak and the very critical need for everyone to follow the CDC guidelines on social distancing.
Your unit leadership and/or HR contact will be in touch with more specific details as soon as they are available. Thank you for your patience as we navigate this evolving issue.
Thank you for your continued good work, whether you are in your normal workspace or at a remote location. Please continue to visit covid19.illinois.edu for detailed information and updates.

Dear Deans, Directors and Department Heads,
As we continue to address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the safety and wellbeing of our students, faculty and staff is our top priority. You have likely been getting many questions about expectations for your employees, so we hope to address some of those concerns with this message.
It cannot be business as usual. But as we transition to this new operating environment, our students and others who depend on us for learning, discovery and engagement can have confidence that we are preparing to conduct business as unusual. While we continue the work of the university, we are finding new ways for many of our faculty and staff to continue their work while keeping themselves and our entire community safe.
Effective now, we are implementing protocols to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines on social distancing. We expect this will involve having some portion of our workforce to conduct business remotely, and we ask that you complete the transition to this temporary model by Wednesday, March 25.  Several factors have led us to make this decision. There have been increased recommendations from public health administrators to maintain social distancing procedures. This remote work environment should help reduce the burden on our local healthcare system, by allowing our employees to avoid unnecessary external contact. Governor Pritzker has also announced that all public and private K-12 schools will be closed until the end of March, and this new work policy also will help allow many of our employees and their families manage childcare while still being able to focus on their work.
To ensure you have flexibility to meet the needs of your unit, we are leaving specific decisions for implementing these policies to deans and unit executive officers. Unit leaders should base their specific decisions on the new COVID-19 Response Illinois Human Resources protocol. This document includes information that will help you make these important decisions. Further updates will be provided as they become available. We also will send an email to HR managers with more specific details.
We encourage you to be as creative, innovative and adaptable as possible to accommodate as many remote workers as possible. In short, when faced with the question of “May I allow this individual to work remotely?” we want you to do everything possible to answer, “Yes.”
This includes student employees and employees who have not previously been allowed to work remotely under ordinary circumstances. We are specifically and strongly encouraging units to find ways to provide opportunities to work remotely for individuals designated by the CDC to be higher risk: older adults, those with chronic conditions, those with immune disorders, pregnant women and others. 
Of course, not all university jobs can be completed remotely. It is important to note that even when classes are being delivered by alternative measures, the campus does not fully close. The residential and research aspects of our operations make a complete closing impossible. Our residence halls will remain open, as will many other essential facilities. And we will be doing everything we can to ensure employees who cannot work remotely are able to follow CDC guidelines, especially those regarding social distancing. Having a portion of our workforce remote allows those who need to be physically on campus to maintain greater social distancing.
We also are exploring ways to assist employees whose work can be conducted only in university facilities and who have compelling justification of the need for them to continue working. It is important that unit executives evaluate these requests carefully and balance the essential nature of this work with the safety of the individual. Again, in these instances, please remind employees to follow CDC guidelines, especially those regarding social distancing.
Finally, these temporary employment guidelines are intended to offer flexibility to units and employees with a goal of keeping our employees working. Units should consult with Illinois Human Resources to explore options for unique situations.
We know that these temporary employment guidelines will come with added complications in an already uncertain time. Thank you for your patience as we navigate this situation. Now, more than ever, it is important that our practices match our university values, and we are confident this is the right decision to protect the health and safety of our employees as we continue to fulfill our missions.

Today, Gov. J.B. Pritzker temporarily closed the state’s pre-kindergarten through 12th grade schools as part of ongoing efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 in Illinois.
As you know, the University of Illinois System also took a proactive approach by migrating courses to online or alternative delivery mechanisms and by reducing large gatherings to create the social distancing that our scientific experts say is key to slowing the outbreak.
Although primary and secondary schools will be closed, we want to remind you that our universities will remain open. Residence and dining halls will be open for students who chose to study from campus rather than home. In addition, many labs will be open for research, as will our hospital and clinics for patient care. 
Faculty and staff will continue their work at our universities. We know that child-care issues will arise with the closing of pre-K through 12th grade classrooms, and employees should work with their supervisors to identify alternative work arrangements where appropriate. You will hear more in the coming days from your university’s leadership with specific guidance on this matter. 
To date, we still have had no confirmed COVID-19 cases among our faculty, staff and students, and we will do everything in our power to limit the impact of the pandemic on our campuses going forward.
Thank you again for your understanding and flexibility. We recognize that this evolving situation is stressful and we encourage you all to take care of one another as we confront this public health crisis together.

I write to follow up on Wednesday’s email from Chancellor Jones and Provost Cangellaris about the steps that campus is taking to slow the spread of COVID-19. These are challenging times, and I hope you all know by now that classes will be online after Spring Break, gatherings of over 50 people are suspended, and travel is restricted.
Beyond the very real human costs, there will be implications for the research enterprise. However, it is important to note that university research offices remain open and we have plans in place to minimize disruptions.
At the unit level, each research group or facility is best positioned to create a continuity plan that will meet their unique needs, and I urge you today to consider how you will manage disruptions, whether short or long term, to your research programs. The guidance below is provided to help you deliberately develop contingency plans with some immediate next steps. 
Within your research group and research service/support operations, please plan for:
Communication. Do you have an updated list of everyone’s cell phone numbers? Designate points of contact in your research, service or work group so that everyone receives timely information about your plans. These communication plans should include a contingency for those who will work remotely. 
Connectivity.Test your technology: be sure you can connect with others in your research group when meeting remotely. 
Decision-Making. Assess, consult and prioritize critical activities and identify back-ups for staff who are responsible for these tasks.
Assessment.
Identify any research experiments that can be ramped down, curtailed, or delayed, particularly as we head into this weekend.
Consider the impact of limited supplies and resources, particularly if they become unavailable.

Remote Work Plans. Develop remote work arrangements where appropriate, as an option for your research projects.
Travel. Travel is restricted. Talk to your Unit Executive Officer if you have essential business travel or research-related field work.
Thank you for your cooperation as this situation continues to rapidly evolve, particularly with changing information from our research sponsors. We understand that this uncertainty is not ideal. As information becomes available, we will provide additional, detailed guidance related to grants management and compliance in the research enterprise.  As always, please see the campus COVID 19 website for the most up-to-date information: https://covid19.illinois.edu/.
If you have questions about contingency planning, please direct an email to ovcr@illinois.edu.
Our best wishes for your safety and the safety of your research groups, colleagues, and families.

Wednesday night you received email from the Chancellor and me announcing that we will be suspending face-to-face instruction starting March 23. This message contains important details about this transition and available support resources.
LOGISTICAL DETAILS:
No face-to-face courses should be offered on or after March 23.
Faculty members are encouraged to transition to alternative delivery modes as soon as possible.
Faculty members should email students enrolled in their courses as soon as possible, but no later than the scheduled meeting time of your first class session after Spring Break, with plans for course continuation. If you do not have full plans ready at that time, your message should let students know when they can expect further details.
Students can choose whether they wish to come to campus after Spring Break. Students without reliable internet access at home are being encouraged to return to campus.
KEY GUIDELINES:
Faculty members are expected to make every effort to continue delivering their course(s). We recognize that some hands-on laboratory or performance courses might be difficult to continue. For those courses, we urge faculty to think creatively and consult colleagues to discuss ways to fulfill learning outcomes using alternative delivery methods.
Courses must comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Student information, including grades, may not be shared via email. It is recommended that students use their university credentials to access course materials and instruction on approved platforms. (Information on U.S. Department of Education student privacy protections can be found here. )
If you have students requiring disability accommodations, please work with DRES to ensure accessibility of your course.
Only university approved educational technologies should be utilized.
Students may NOT be asked to pay for additional fees related to course delivery. This includes proctoring service fees.
Any synchronous course sessions (such as Zoom, Skype for Business, Blackboard Collaborate) must be held during regularly scheduled class times.
Be mindful of how teaching assistants are utilized in the alternative delivery plan. Current guidelines and restrictions on TA time and workload should be maintained.
Please try to use the lowest bandwidth option that meets your instructional needs. Use Zoom only for interactive discussions. Do not use Zoom for classes of greater than 150 students. Use video, audio or text options for lecture delivery whenever possible.
If you use Zoom, be sure to login to https://illinois.zoom.usto generate your account. Free accounts made directly on the Zoom website may have restricted bandwidth and do not allow as many participants.
SUPPORT RESOURCES:
Walkthrough guides, training sessions and individual support for faculty on transitioning to alternatives modes of instructional delivery are available at illinois.edu/keepteaching. Use this portal to access CITL staff who are standing by and ready to help.
There is a checklist for faculty to help ensure you have completed all the steps necessary to transition your course to an alternative delivery mode HERE.
Some departments, schools and colleges have additional resources and support for their faculty. Please look for additional emails from your department, school or college.
All student technical support needs should be directed to consult@illinois.edu.
We appreciate your efforts to ensure instruction continues for our students. We also appreciate your flexibility and understanding with students who will be rapidly adapting to new instructional circumstances.
This is a singular time for our institution, and I thank each of you for your leadership, your creative approaches and your dedication to our students and our missions.

We write today to share new policies for the University of Illinois System and its universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield, all designed to protect the health and welfare of our students, faculty and staff amid the global COVID-19 pandemic.
The proactive policies are focused squarely on doing our part to help curb the virus. Fortunately, there have been no confirmed cases among our faculty, staff and students. But such cases have been increasing in Illinois and our experts say early intervention is the best option to limit the spread.
Our policies will adopt best practices endorsed by state and national health officials by minimizing face-to-face exposure in classrooms and other types of large gatherings, and by limiting international and domestic travel. They were developed with guidance from the leading-edge healthcare experts across our universities, who have been consulting daily with a leadership team composed of the president, the chancellors and the provosts from all three universities. We will continue to monitor the outbreak and stay in constant contact with the Governor’s Office, the Illinois Department of Public Health, local health departments, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other universities around the state and the nation.
The new policies were carefully crafted to safeguard our students, faculty and staff without compromising the world-class education and the groundbreaking research discovery that are synonymous with the U of I System. They are:
Instruction
Courses at each of our three universities will immediately begin migrating to online or alternative delivery mechanisms to provide the social distancing that helps limit transmission of the virus, with a goal of completion by March 23. Classes will be held at their currently scheduled times.
Online and other alternative learning methods will continue until further notice, but our expectation is that it will be temporary and students will be updated regularly via email and updates on system and university websites.
Students have the option of studying remotely from home or from their campus residence after spring break.
Our campuses will remain open and ready to serve students, including residence and dining halls.
Each university will provide specific guidance for their students regarding both academic and housing arrangements.
Faculty and staff will continue their work on campus, including research, and human resources offices will provide guidance for work conditions that foster safety and for employees who suspect exposure or infection and must self-quarantine.
Events
Events with more than 50 attendees that are university-sponsored or hosted by registered student organizations will be suspended indefinitely, effective Friday, March 13.
Events may occur via livestream or other telecommunications, or be postponed to a future date.
Please check with each university for specific guidance.
Travel
All university-sponsored international travel is prohibited, along with non-essential domestic travel until further notice.
Personal international travel is strongly discouraged, and we urge caution and the exercise of good judgment for personal domestic travel.
Leaders of our three universities will share further information for how these policies will be implemented to address the specific educational and safety needs of their campus communities. UI Hospital and clinics will provide additional protocols to address the unique needs in providing care for their patients.
We recognize the many challenges this will create for our students, faculty and staff. We pledge to do everything in our power to support you during this temporary move to safeguard your health and the health of people in the communities we call home.
Our policies are rooted in our expert scientific knowledge base and exhibit an abundance of caution to take care of each other until the COVID-19 outbreak eases. We are all in this together, and appreciate your support and understanding.

We are writing to provide you with an update about the crime incidents we detailed in a Community Safety Notice last week.
As we noted, it was reported that two men had approached U. of I. students in off-campus locations and displayed what appeared to be handguns while demanding the students’ property. The Champaign Police Department on Friday arrested a juvenile who is one of the offenders involved in those incidents. During the arrest, police recovered a BB gun that is possibly one of the weapons used to intimidate the victims.
The Champaign Police Department is continuing to investigate, and we will provide additional updates when appropriate.
Anyone with information is encouraged to contact the Champaign Police Department at 217-351-4545. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android. All messages to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of identifying information and forwarded to police by an independent third party.
This is our community. Let's stay together.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks escort if you need one, or download the mobile app for iOS or Android.
Be alert. Maintaining awareness of your surroundings is critical, especially when traveling at night. Wearing headphones or looking at your phone diminishes your ability to respond to your surroundings. Walk with purpose, and stay attentive.
Trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.
If you choose to consume alcohol, please be responsible. Remember your ability to respond is diminished by overconsumption of alcohol.

2020-03-10T16:24:00Z,2020-03-10,16:24,76060,Spring Break COVID-19 Safety Information,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28781.html,"Dear Campus Community,
In recent weeks, you have received various updates with information related to the widening COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak and the ways the situation may affect our campus and surrounding Champaign-Urbana community. As we approach our upcoming spring break on March 14-22, there are some health-related precautious I would like to share with you.
For those traveling domestically or abroad during spring break, I urge you to monitor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and State Department travel advisories for all destinations where you will be traveling. The safety level of any given destination could change before or during your trip, making it difficult to return to campus by the March 23 resumption of classes.
Our current policy is that any individual who travels to a CDC COVID-19 Level 2 or Level 3 country will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days before returning to campus. For more information, please see the university’s Self-Quarantine Policy.
Additionally, if you are a student and returning to the United States from a high-risk region:
You must complete the COVID-19 Travel Risk Screening Form (located under Forms), accessible through the MyMcKinley student portal, https://mymckinley.illinois.edu.
You may contact McKinley Health Center via email at studenthealthcenter@illinois.edu or phone at (217) 333-2700 for guidance.
As you know, other universities have announced alternatives to in-person classes for their students. We are continuing to look at a variety of options for delivering classroom instruction, in the event that face-to-face instruction needs to be suspended.
As a precaution, if you leave campus for Spring Break, we strongly advise that you take with you everything that you would need to continue your studies if the decision was made to suspend in-person classes. This could include books, computers, supplies, etc. Please also continue to check your email and the COVID-19 website for updates and more specific information on these decisions from the university and from your colleges and units.
If you have additional questions, I encourage you to reach out to the following resources:
Illinois Human Resources
International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS)
McKinley Health Center
Self-isolation and monitoring guidance

Student Assistance Center
Champaign-Urbana Public Health District
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Regardless of your destination, here are some spring break safety tips to follow:
Designate an emergency contact and leave itinerary, contact info, ID numbers, and credit/debit info with them.
Always be aware of your surroundings and how to get back to your hotel.
Only take what you absolutely need. Keep valuables, IDs, and money secured while away.
Know what VISA, ID, or passport is required to reach your destination.
Inform bank providers you will be traveling to avoid service disruption.
Together with my university colleagues, I will continue to carefully monitor developments that might affect the health and safety of our community. I will also continue to work closely with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District to take necessary precautions and will communicate critical updates to the campus community as new information becomes available.
Sincerely,Robert Parker, FACP, MBA, MDDirector, McKinley Health Center"
2020-03-05T15:20:00Z,2020-03-05,15:20,75959,An update on COVID-19,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28774.html,"Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
The worldwide COVID-19 outbreak continues to spread both this new disease, but also the uncertainty and apprehension that come with such rapidly changing circumstances and limited information. We also understand that these concerns extend to our entire community – from campus to Champaign, Urbana, Savoy and beyond.
We have established a new, central web resource, https://covid19.illinois.edu, as the starting point for information about the virus and university operations and plans. This site archives campus communications on the issue, provides some answers to the most frequent questions we’re hearing and links directly to the most current updates on COVID-19 impacts across our critical university operations – from health and safety to academics to human resources to student support. We have also set up an email address (covid-19@illinois.edu) for general questions. I encourage you to visit the site regularly and to share the address with anyone you know who might need this information. The site also links to the most current precautions advised by public health officials.
At this point, with no confirmed cases in our local area, most of our academic and business operations are continuing as usual. Classes continue to meet, and events continue to take place. And we all hope that circumstances do not require us to take any significant or disruptive new actions.
The Centers for Disease Control, state and local health officials are telling us to prepare for local cases. We are not currently aware of any confirmed cases in Urbana-Champaign. But as we have seen around the world and across the country, that can change very quickly. We have been using this time to develop response plans to ensure the safety and well-being of our students, faculty, staff and visitors, as well as the continued smooth operation of the university throughout the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak. I have outlined some of these steps in more detail at the end of this message.
But as important as plans and policies will be if the virus reaches anywhere in our local community, our success in keeping one another safe will be determined by our actions as human beings. We work and live closely together here and the results of our choices do not stop at the doors of our homes or offices.
This virus will impact all of us who live here in this area. If we are to confront a disease that will threaten our entire community, we must act together as a united community. We may not even know one another, but as this situation intensifies, I ask that we remember how much we all have in common.  
Students in our classes are worried about their well-being and thinking about their academic progress. Their parents and families – from all over the globe – want to know that their children will be safe. Staff and faculty members are thinking of their own families and friends. Members of the local community are dealing with these same uncertainties and challenges in their daily lives.
This is a community challenge. It is one that will truly require a community to navigate through it.
We will continue to update the COVID-19 website regularly, and we will communicate critical updates to all of our campus and community when we get new information.
Sincerely,
Robert J. Jones
March 5, 2020 Updates on Our Planning Efforts:
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has implemented a multi-faceted response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The university-community Infectious Disease Working Group (IDWG) has been meeting since the end of January, tracking the virus, developing plans for mitigation and response, and implementing those plans.
We established working groups in recent weeks, and those groups are identifying possible impacts of the outbreak on our campus community, as well as the triggering events that would initiate responses and the recommended responses. We are addressing the immediate impacts of the outbreak, but we also are planning for all possible longer-term impacts in the event the outbreak is not resolved quickly. The groups are addressing the following topics:
Academic continuity – this group is developing plans to ensure we can provide instruction to both our current and prospective students throughout this outbreak.
For Study Abroad students: We have implemented plans to allow any Study Abroad students to end their programs early and return home. Details about these plans can be found here.
Students, faculty or staff returning from CDC Level 2 or 3 countries will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days before they will be allowed on campus. The self-quarantine policy can be found here.
In light of continuing risks, we have cancelled all international spring break trips as well as any university-sponsored domestic student spring break programs that require air travel. More information about this can be found here.
For on-campus students: We are identifying ways to shift to online delivery of courses should the university be unable to continue providing in-person instruction.
For international students: We are developing options for new international students who might not be able to travel to campus this summer or fall to begin classes, and we are developing options for international students who are currently on campus and might not be able to return to their home country at the conclusion of the semester because of the outbreak. Information for international students can be found here.

Campus emergency response – this group is preparing for the possibility that one or more persons on our campus contract the virus.
Communications – this group is creating a communications plans and collateral materials that will ensure we are providing accurate, useful, actionable information to the various university stakeholders in a way that prevents unnecessary fear among our community members. A central campus web resource can be found here.
Community emergency response – this group includes university representatives, as well as leaders from area governments, healthcare organizations, schools and other relevant agencies, and members are coordinating efforts to prepare for the possibility that one or more persons in the local community could contract the virus.
Disability issues – this group is considering special concerns related to people with disabilities in the event the outbreak interrupts normal campus operations that are vital to these members of our campus community.
Events – this group is considering the possible need to postpone or cancel events that involve large gatherings (e.g., athletic events, Engineering Open House, Commencement), as well as how to mitigate the negative impact of any such cancellations.
Financial issues – this group is determining how to mitigate the financial implications for students whose studies are interrupted by the outbreak, and it is estimating the possible financial costs to the university.
Housing – this group is working to identify housing options that could accommodate all students currently studying abroad in the event they all choose to return to campus because of the outbreak, and it is identifying housing options that could accommodate the international students who are currently on campus but might not be able to return to their home country at the conclusion of the semester. More information about this can be found here.
Human resources – this group is identifying and addressing potential employment issues that will arise if travel is limited this summer or fall, as well as issues involving current employees whose working conditions could be impacted by the outbreak. Human resource updates for employees can be found here.
Research issues – this group is working to ensure that ongoing vital research operations are not interrupted even if the university must temporarily cease most normal operations.
Travel – this group is addressing the possibility that air and mass transportation in the community could be interrupted by the outbreak, and it is providing guidance and support for students who are studying abroad and anyone traveling on university business.
University of Illinois System Coordination – The University of Illinois System has established a Planning and Response Team to help coordinate the system’s response and communications. Representatives of all three campuses are participating in this effort."

2020-03-02T17:16:00Z,2020-03-02,17:16,75955,Community Safety Notice,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28771.html,"Dear campus community member:
We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in an off-campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, you can view the daily crime log.
The Champaign Police Department has informed University of Illinois Police of two incidents that occurred within a block and within a few minutes of each other. At 10:44 p.m. Sunday, in the 400 block of South Fifth Street, Champaign, it was reported that a U. of I. student was approached by two men, both of whom displayed handguns and demanded the student’s belongings. The student gave one of the men his property, and the two offenders fled. Several minutes later, in the 300 block of South Fifth Street, Champaign, a second U. of I. student was approached by a man who displayed a handgun, but the offender fled immediately. Both students were approached as they entered private apartment complexes. Neither student was physically injured. The Champaign Police Department is investigating.
The University of Illinois Police Department, in cooperation with the Champaign Police Department and the Urbana Police Department, has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area. Between these agencies, our campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 1,900 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information is encouraged to contact the Champaign Police Department at 217-351-4545. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android. All messages to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of identifying information and forwarded to police by an independent third party.
This is our community. Let's stay together.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks escort if you need one.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 9-1-1 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.
If you choose to consume alcohol, please be responsible. Remember your ability to respond is diminished by overconsumption of alcohol.

2020-03-02T13:24:00Z,2020-03-02,13:24,75928,COVID-19 Update: International Travel,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28770.html,"Dear Faculty Members, Staff and Students,
With the continued uncertainty caused by the rapidly changing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) situation globally and nationally, below are several important updates that affect our university community.
We want to share four recent developments, as well as additional information about precautions we are taking to ensure the health and safety of our campus community:
All students, faculty members and staff are required to leave Italy. New escalations of U.S. Department of State travel advisory to “Level 4, Avoid Travel” for regions of Italy have led us to suspend all academic programs in that country. In accordance with this decision and the federal direction, all students, and faculty members and staff on university business are required to depart Italy as soon as possible. This decision will impact 137 study abroad students in Italy. The full communication about this action can be found here.
All students, faculty members and staff are required to leave the Daegu region of South Korea, and encouraged to leave all sites in South Korea.New escalations of U.S. Department of State travel advisory to “Level 4, Avoid Travel” for the Daegu region of South Korea have led us to suspend academic programs in that area. We are requiring all students, and faculty members and staff on university business in the Daegu region to leave the country as soon as possible. Additionally, we are also strongly encouraging students, faculty members and staff in any part of South Korea to depart voluntarily. These decisions will impact 15 study abroad students in South Korea. The full communication about this action can be found here.
In accordance with existing and escalating travel alerts, travel to China, Iran, Italy, and the Daegu region of South Korea on university business is being restricted.All students, faculty members and staff are prohibited from traveling to China, Iran, Italy and the Daegu region of South Korea on university business or using university resources. This is an evolving situation; the list of countries may change rapidly.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has instructed universities to consider postponing or canceling student foreign exchange programs, and we are offering all study abroad students the opportunity to end their program early.In response to a growing number of questions and concerns expressed by students and their families, we are offering all 852 of our study abroad participants in any location the opportunity to voluntarily end their program immediately and return to their permanent home. We are working diligently to arrange alternative methods to deliver instruction to any students who want to continue making academic progress this semester. We recognize that there can be financial and academic implications for students, and we are committed to working with them to the best of our ability to mitigate any negative impacts.
We are also taking several precautionary measures to ensure those returning to our campus from areas with COVID-19 exposure do not present any safety or health concerns for our community.
Students, faculty members and staff who are coming from countries under CDC travel advisories of Level 2 or 3 who choose to return to the campus to resume activities will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days. Illinois Human Resources and McKinley Health Center will be working with returning travelers to ensure compliance with the 14-day self-quarantine protocol. A full list of CDC travel advisories can be found here.
It is also important to note that any individuals traveling to nations that are under CDC Levels 2 or 3 travel advisories during spring break also will be required to observe and prove this 14-day self-quarantine before being allowed to resume normal campus activities. For those traveling abroad during spring break, we urge you to monitor the CDC and State Department travel advisories, as the safety level of any given destination could change before or during your trip, making it difficult to return to campus by the March 23 resumption of classes. Please watch in the coming days and weeks for additional information on issues such as summer Study Abroad and other potential longer-term impacts of COVID-19.
We understand that the continued spread of the virus is generating concern and uncertainty for many. At this time, there are still no cases of COVID-19 in the Champaign-Urbana community. And we are continuing to work closely with state and local health officials on all medical issues and to implement precautions to help ensure the safety of all who live here.
Thank you all for your patience and understanding as we continue to make decisions and develop plans to protect our faculty members, staff and students on a constantly evolving issue.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellorAndreas C. CangellarisProvost"

On Friday, March 6, 2020, many students and visitors will participate in an event known as Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. The university does not support or condone this event.
The Champaign, Urbana, and University of Illinois police departments, assisted by other local and state agencies, will patrol the campus district on March 6. They will enforce all applicable ordinances in commercial and residential areas and have authority to intervene if private parties threaten to disturb the peace. In addition, Champaign and Urbana officials will enact restrictions on liquor sales intended to curb overconsumption. Emergency medical personnel will be available to provide care.
University police will continue to focus on protecting students, staff, faculty, and university property. If asking a disruptive student to leave class could escalate into a confrontation, you may seek assistance from these officers. Should you need to report an incident, call METCAD at 911 for emergencies, 333-8911 for non-emergencies.
As in years past, we have made it clear to students that academic business will continue as usual on Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. Instructors are encouraged not to cancel classes.
The Student Code https://studentcode.illinois.edu/ addresses student responsibilities on campus. Sections 1-102(d) concerns classroom conduct expectations, section 1-305 is the policy on drugs, and section 1-307 focuses on alcohol. The Code empowers instructors to ask disruptive students to leave class. Names of disruptive students should be reported to the Office of Student Conflict Resolution at 217-333-3680.
Students are not to bring any liquids into Foellinger Auditorium and Lincoln Hall Theatre. Longstanding policy prohibits liquids and food in these spaces.
Interference with the academic mission of the university will result in students facing serious consequences. Thank you for reinforcing this message before and on March 6.

2020-02-18T15:38:00Z,2020-02-18,15:38,75935,Illinois Alcohol and Other Drugs (AOD) Prevention Program,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28752.html,"Dear Students and Employees,
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act requires the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:
http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/
The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.
Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to marijuana in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s marijuana prohibition.
The university’s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.
The university’s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.
Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. University employees should contact Illinois Human Resources at (217) 333-2137.
Sincerely,
Dr. Danita M. B. YoungVice Chancellor for Student Affairs"
2020-02-14T17:56:00Z,2020-02-14,17:56,75878,Information about a case of bacterial meningitis on campus,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28766.html,"Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
I write to let you know that a student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has been diagnosed with a case of bacterial meningitis, as confirmed by the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. The student, a resident of off-campus housing, has been isolated at an area hospital for treatment, and authorities have identified, contacted and treated anyone who may have had close contact with the student – including hospital staff.
As a result of those efforts, we do not believe there is a risk of the illness spreading.
Bacterial meningitis is a serious illness that spreads to other people through sharing personal items, kissing or prolonged close exposure such as residing in the same household. There is low risk to other people in the general community.
When we learn of incidents like this, we act as quickly and carefully as possible to limit the potential spread within campus and into the broader community. The university works with state and local health officials and the McKinley Health Center to contact the students, staff, faculty members or others in the community who may have been exposed during that period.
We will keep you informed if there are any new developments that would impact the health and safety of our campus.
Sincerely,
Dr. Danita M. B. YoungVice Chancellor for Student Affairs"

By now, I hope you have all read President Killeen’s message sharing the Governor’s announcement to release $500 million in state funding for the Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) and the Illinois Innovation Network (IIN). This is exciting news for the future economic prosperity for our state, and it is also a cause for celebration for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and our entire community.
The DPI and IIN partnerships and initiatives that our faculty and staff are building will have an enormous impact here. From building our data sciences infrastructure to renovating Altgeld Hall to expanding NCSA in support of cutting-edge computing as well as investments that position our leadership in quantum to expanding our capacity to lead in quantum science to growing opportunities for our entrepreneurial faculty and students to bringing new businesses to our Research Park to bolstering our public engagement programs, this announcement today in Chicago will directly result in new jobs, new educational opportunities and new economic development right here at home.
Today’s announcement marks a major step forward in bringing public and private partners together to invest in the future of our state in ways that will drive a global economy. And as President Killeen also noted, one exciting new private investment was announced today in the form of a $10 million gift from our Board of Trustees Chair Don Edwards and his wife, Anne. Both are Gies College of Business graduates and their gift will support scholarship initiatives in that college as well as support for athletics and new investments in DPI and IIN. We are grateful to Don and Anne for their generous gift, which exemplifies the support expressed by our alumni and friends for these new endeavors.
This is an exciting day for all of us here at Illinois.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

I am delighted to share the news that Governor J.B. Pritzker announced today he is releasing $500 million in state funding set aside for development of our Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) and Illinois Innovation Network (IIN).
The significant state appropriation will support planning and construction of DPI’s permanent facility in downtown Chicago and IIN hubs at each of our three universities, on our satellite campuses in Peoria and Rockford, and at every public university across the state. We are working to break ground for DPI within 2020 and to begin construction on some IIN hubs soon.
Governor Pritzker anticipates that his release of funding will also accelerate private fundraising for DPI and IIN, which have gained momentum since the governor took office 13 months ago and became a champion for the pioneering initiatives. The U of I System has pledged to match state funding and has already raised $230 million in personal and corporate donations, along with another $224 million in non-state funding.
That sum grew today with the announcement of an historically generous gift from U of I Board of Trustees Chairman Don Edwards and his wife, Anne. The $10 million gift is the largest ever by a U of I trustee, and will be divided between DPI/IIN and programs at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where both Don and Anne earned their degrees.
News releases sent to media today provide more detail on the governor’s release of funding and the Edwards' gift.
I am deeply grateful to everyone across our University System who has a hand in making DPI and IIN a reality – from system and university leadership to our growing DPI and IIN teams to the nearly 1,000 faculty who signed on to help guide programming. Your work will write the next chapters in our long legacy of excellence, and fuel a new era of progress and prosperity for our state and nation.
Sincerely,
Tim"

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This Campus Safety Notice is issued in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about crime to aid in the prevention of similar crimes and to assist in the identification of offenders.
This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, you can view the daily crime log.
The Champaign Police Department has notified us that the following armed robbery took place at 12:25 a.m. Sunday at the intersection of Oak Street and Armory Avenue (map), in Champaign:
A U. of I. student was walking alone when he was approached by two men. One of the offenders held the student’s arms while the other displayed what appeared to be a firearm and took the student’s wallet and cellphone. The student was not physically harmed.
The University of Illinois Police Department has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area, and we are fortunate to have our force supplemented by the Urbana and Champaign police departments. Between these agencies, the Urbana campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 1,900 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the Champaign Police Department at 217-351-4545. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android. All messages to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of identifying information and forwarded to police by an independent third party.
This is our community. Let's stay together.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks escort if you need one.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 9-1-1 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.
If you choose to consume alcohol, please be responsible. Remember your ability to respond is diminished by overconsumption of alcohol.

Here is a link to a Climate Survey on Sexual Misconduct email that was sent to all Illinois students at 8 a.m. this morning.
You can read the massmail here.
The message provides a summary of the results for a sexual misconduct survey we conducted in the spring of 2019, as well as a link to view the full report on the We Care website.
In the email, I share with students my commitment to work together as a community to eliminate the problem of sexual misconduct on campus. Together we can make our campus a safe and welcoming place for everyone.
Please review the detailed report so you are aware of the findings and prepared to direct students to resources of support should they request them.
Questions regarding this report should be directed to Chantelle Thompson, Director of Marketing and Communications for Student Affairs (cthomps@illinois.edu | (217) 300-4221).

Sexual misconduct is prevalent in our society and the University of Illinois is not immune. We are working to improve the campus climate, so we asked you to tell us about your experiences in classrooms, residence halls, apartments, the library, bars, restaurants, and everywhere in the community.
By understanding what is happening and what you think about how the University will respond, we can better address this critical issue and ensure that you have the best experience possible as an Illinois student.
Here is what you told us:
You tell your friends or family, not necessarily University authorities, of sexual misconduct, so we need to increase efforts to help you, your teachers, all our employees and your parents learn about the resources available to help, and we need to make sure you know that we are committed to supporting you.
You understand that we will respect your privacy and keep reports of sexual misconduct confidential.
You are fairly confident that the University will handle incidents appropriately. Programs such as First Year Campus Acquaintance Rape Education (FYCARE), ICARE Bystander Intervention, the We Care website and other promotional materials must be continued and enhanced.
Although being under the influence of alcohol is not an excuse or reason for sexual misconduct, there is a relationship between the misuse of alcohol and sexual misconduct. We will use this information to help you better understand this relationship and the dangers of being under the influence of alcohol in certain settings.
We greatly appreciate the time many of you took to share your experiences. During the 2019 spring semester, 12,500 graduate and undergraduate students were invited to take part in a survey. Of those invited, 2,076 completed at least a portion of the survey and the respondents reflect current student demographics. I am committed to continuing this effort to understand the student experience around sexual misconduct and doing whatever I can to improve the climate on campus. We will hold focus groups to explore more ways to improve our response to survivors.
As the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, I am committed to garnering the resources of all departments to eliminate the problem of sexual misconduct on campus. The Chancellor, Provost, and all executives of the University share my dedication to this important mission. We need you to help us by looking out for each other, intervening when you see a potential problem and helping your friends and family find resources when they feel they have been the victim of sexual misconduct.
Detailed findings from the sexual misconduct survey are available at wecare.illinois.edu/reports.
Together, we can all make a difference,
Dr. Danita M. B. YoungVice Chancellor for Student Affairs"

I write to share the bittersweet news that Susan Koch will retire June 30 after nearly a decade as chancellor of the University of Illinois at Springfield and vice president of the U of I System.
Our longest-serving current chancellor, Susan will leave a legacy of excellence that will be felt for generations. Since taking office in 2011, her leadership has brought new academic programs, new opportunities for students and a new, award-winning Student Union that has given the growing campus a lasting new hub of student activity.
On behalf of the entire U of I family, I am deeply grateful for her passion, her vision, her commitment and her persistence to ensure teaching and scholarship at UIS that transforms the lives of students and serves the needs of our state and nation.
I equally value Susan’s friendship and counsel, and wish her and her husband Dennis a retirement filled with family, friends and joy.
The news release below will be sent to media this morning announcing Susan’s much-deserved retirement.
Sincerely,
Tim
UIS Chancellor Koch announces retirementLed academic and physical transformation of university since 2011
SPRINGFIELD –Susan J. Koch, chancellor of the University of Illinois Springfield (UIS) since 2011, announced Friday she will retire as chancellor of UIS and vice president of the University of Illinois System effective June 30. She is currently the longest-serving chancellor of the U of I System.
During her tenure, Koch has provided leadership and vision for UIS, which is ranked the top regional public university in Illinois by U.S. News & World Report.
“The past nine years have been among the most fulfilling of my career, and it has been a privilege to work with so many outstanding faculty, staff and students,” Koch said. “I love the university and the community my husband Dennis and I have called home for nearly a decade, and I am so proud of everything this young university has achieved.”
U of I System President Tim Killeen said Koch will leave a legacy that will be felt by students for generations.
“Susan’s leadership and persistence have enriched UIS’s academic excellence, provided new opportunities for students, expanded and beautified the campus and laid the groundwork to do even more,” Killeen said. “I am grateful for her commitment, her friendship and I wish her and Dennis nothing but happiness in their much-deserved retirement.”
Since her appointment in July 2011, UIS has added numerous academic programs to meet the interests of students as well as the needs of local and regional employers. They include programs in information systems security, data analytics, theater, exercise science, and a new bachelor of science in nursing through a partnership with University of Illinois at Chicago and Memorial Health System. With Koch at the helm, UIS also has successfully recruited two University of Illinois Distinguished Scholars – Ken Kriz in public administration and Graham Peck in Lincoln studies. The additions are part of an initiative to attract senior star faculty who can help transform the system’s three universities through their exceptional teaching and scholarship.
Record fundraising under Koch’s leadership has resulted in construction of a new, award-winning $21.7 million Student Union, the first on the UIS campus, and an increase in scholarship support to improve students’ access to a UIS education.
Koch has led many successful fundraising endeavors for UIS. The Brilliant Futures Campaign, completed in 2012, surpassed its $28 million goal. The current Reaching Stellar Campaign, set to conclude in 2022, has raised more than $33 million of its $40 million goal to date.
Private giving has also led to the creation of “The Sangamon Experience,” a unique exhibition space and research initiative opened Jan. 30 that will support faculty and students and spur new research, teaching and community engagement about the Sangamon region of Illinois. A new Center for Lincoln Studies, also supported by private gifts, will open later this spring.
Koch was instrumental in the university’s August 2018 acquisition of Innovate Springfield. In joining UIS, the downtown innovation and business center became the first hub of the Illinois Innovation Network, a network of research and education centers across the state led by the U of I System. They will partner with the system’s Discovery Partners Institute in Chicago to foster the innovation and talent that drives progress and economic growth.
Her leadership has also led to expansion of the university’s young Division II athletics program, whose teams have won individual and conference championships. At the same time, Prairie Stars student-athletes this past fall earned the highest collective grade-point average (3.38) in university history.
Koch has secured several awards from the U of I System’s Chester Fund, a privately funded endowment to support the acquisition of significant artwork for campus beautification. Acquisitions include “The Young Lawyer,” a Lincoln sculpture by George Lundeen; a Shakespeare Garden featuring “Shakespeare,” a sculpture by James Price; and works by Sanford Biggers and Lisa Williamson for the Student Union.
“While I am looking forward to having time that my husband and I can devote to enjoying our family and to unlocking new possibilities to grow and contribute, this was a bittersweet decision,” Koch said. “What makes it easier is my confidence that UIS will continue to be an asset for our community and our state thanks to dedicated colleagues, alumni and donors who believe in our vision to be a pathway of opportunity for the thousands of students we educate each year.”
“To have played a small part in the success of our university is a gift I will always treasure,”  Koch added.
Killeen said there will be a timely and transparent leadership transition process.
Koch is the sixth chief executive in the nearly 50-year history of the university. It was known as Sangamon State University for 25 years and has been part of the U of I System since 1995.
Koch’s career encompasses more than four decades in education, with the last 35 years in higher education. Before her appointment as UIS chancellor, Koch served as provost and vice president for academic affairs at Northern Michigan University. She also served as associate provost and graduate dean at the University of Northern Iowa, where she began her career in higher education as a professor of community and public health.
Koch earned a bachelor’s degree with honors from Dakota State University in South Dakota and master’s and doctoral degrees from the University of Northern Iowa. In 2016, she was awarded an honorary doctorate in public service from Dakota State University. Koch is also the author of a widely read monthly column, “UIS Perspectives,” for Springfield’s State Journal-Register and has been active with several community organizations along with serving on many boards in central Illinois.

We continue to monitor the coronavirus and to take any new actions that are warranted as new information emerges in this rapidly changing situation. Last week’s messages from Provost Cangellaris and from Dr. Parker can be found here if you missed those updates.
As I write today, there are no confirmed cases of the virus in Urbana-Champaign and no individuals who are suspected of being infected. There have been two confirmed cases in the Chicago area in the same family. The McKinley Health Center is regularly updating their website with the latest information on the disease and steps you can take to protect yourself.
But while the virus may not have a physical presence here, we know the situation in China at the moment is very serious and has been the basis for a Level 4 U.S. travel advisory. To those in our community with family and friends navigating this difficult time there, the thoughts of all of us at Illinois are with you. And I would remind all of our students, staff and faculty that we have a number of resources for support and assistance if you are ever in need of them. Students can contact the Student Assistance Center or the Emergency Dean (217-333-0050) or find other resources at odos.illinois.edu/community-of-care. Faculty/Staff Assistance Services (217-244-5312) is the place to start for staff and faculty members.
For other questions and concerns, here are some suggested resources.  
Students with questions or concerns about their health or believe they might be experiencing symptoms related to coronavirus infection should contact the McKinley Health Center at 217-333-2700.
Faculty or staff who are concerned about their health or believe they might be experiencing symptoms should call their regular health care provider for guidance.
Faculty, students and staff with questions or concerns about travel plans or the suspension of academic programs in China should contact International Safety and Security at safetyabroad@illinois.edu or call 217-333-6104.
Human Resources staff members in colleges, departments and units who are receiving questions related to employment policies and practices should contact Illinois Human Resources for guidance.
I want to thank everyone in our community for taking steps to protect yourselves and one another. Whether it is wearing a mask because you are concerned about getting or spreading any infection, staying home from work or class when you are sick or getting your annual flu shot, we are all healthier and safer.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"
2020-01-29T09:08:00Z,2020-01-29,9:8,75756,Update on coronavirus for the campus community,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28749.html,"Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
As you all know, the rapid emergence of the coronavirus in the past weeks is generating a great deal of public information and also many questions about our campus and community actions. Monday’s massmail from Dr. Robert Parker, director of McKinley Health Center, provides some important background, and I encourage you to read it if you have not already done so.
I want to share a central update here on precautions, plans and decisions based on what we know of the situation today.
What is the status of the coronavirus in our community and what precautions are in place here? 
There has been one confirmed case in the State of Illinois.
The Champaign-Urbana community has no confirmed cases nor are there any individuals in our community under investigation for possible infections.
When the virus was linked to Wuhan, China, the university identified approximately 150 students from that area.
McKinley Health Center Director Dr. Bob Parker contacted each of the students informing them of safety precautions and urging them to be seen at McKinley if they believed they had any symptoms of the illness.
Many of them had not traveled home over winter break.
Of those who did travel to Wuhan, some have elected to self-quarantine, monitor themselves, and/or wear a surgical mask when going to class and attending other activities.
No one with a link to Wuhan has exhibited any symptoms of the illness.
On January 22, the first day of classes for the spring semester, McKinley Health Center also began screening all students who came to the Center with symptoms.
Does the continuing emergency of the coronavirus in China impact students, staff or faculty traveling from the United States?
Based on newly issued federal advisories, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is suspending academic programs in China for the 2020 spring semester. Students will not be allowed to travel to China for university-related matters while the advisories are in effect.
While the university draws on a variety of sources for information, we use U.S. government sources as the benchmark for our decisions. On Monday (Jan. 27), The Department of State elevated its travel advisory for China to Level 3, Reconsider Travel. (More information on the advisory levels is here.) Also on Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Warning Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel for China.
This decision will affect only a very small number of students studying with partner universities in China. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is in contact with those students and will work with them to adjust their academic plans for the semester.
Does this suspension of student academic programs also apply to faculty and staff? 
We encourage faculty and staff planning to travel to China to review the federal advisories and make an informed decision regarding travel. The concern is the spread of the coronavirus, as well as logistic difficulties experienced as China implements containment measures.
Travelers should also be aware of the demographics shared by CDC for being most at risk, which includes older adults and people with underlying health conditions. If faculty and staff travel, we encourage enrollment in the university’s international insurance and the Department of State Smart Traveler Enrollment Program.
Faculty or staff who are currently involved in academic programs in China should contact their department, unit or college executive officer for guidance on operations for the rest of the semester.
Where can I get more information?
Students with questions or concerns about their health or believe they might be experiencing symptoms related to coronavirus infection should contact the McKinley Health Center at 217-333-2700.
Faculty or staff who are concerned about their health or believe they might be experiencing symptoms should call their regular healthcare provider for guidance.
Faculty, students and staff with questions or concerns about travel plans or the suspension of academic programs in China should contact International Safety and Security at safetyabroad@illinois.edu or call 217-333-6104.
Human resources staff members in colleges, departments and units who are receiving questions related to employment policies and practices will receive more guidance directly from Illinois Human Resources.
Department heads and directors of graduate studies will receive information from the Graduate College on implications for applications to graduate programs for prospective students from countries affected by the coronavirus.
This is clearly a rapidly changing situation, and we will continue to carefully monitor developments that might impact the health and safety of any members of our community. We will work closely with our medical staff and with the CUPHD to take necessary precautions and to share critical and accurate new information as we learn of it.
Thank you for your careful attention and for your efforts in protecting your own health and that of your colleagues, friends and our entire community.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost"

The university continues to work closely with our local, state, and national public health agencies to address the threat presented by the Novel Coronavirus 2019-CoV. We also follow regular updates from the World Health Organization (WHO) at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/ and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html.
The United States has been successful in containing the spread of the virus. As of the morning of Sunday, January 26, there are five confirmed cases of the coronavirus in four states within the U.S. With an incubation period of 14 days, it is possible to see more cases announced over the next week or so, linked to Wuhan City, China.
The university began planning and implementing a response as soon as we learned of the national threat. On Friday, January 24, McKinley Health Center contacted students who have a known connection to Wuhan City. Students who did not travel home to Wuhan City over winter break are not at increased risk. Of those who did travel, some have elected to self-quarantine, monitor themselves, and/or wear a surgical mask when going to class and attending other activities.
All students who come to McKinley Health Center with respiratory symptoms are being masked at the entrance and educated regarding ways to keep themselves and others healthy. Students who identify themselves as at risk for a respiratory illness, via phone call prior to visiting the health center or upon entry to the health center, will be masked and receive special handling.
Coronaviruses are generally spread by droplet contact. This commonly means that you must be within 6 feet of an infected person who is coughing and sneezing, or via close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands or touching an object or surface with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes before washing your hands. Epidemiologists are implementing these intensive “airborne” precautions because the Novel Coronavirus 2019-CoV is not well studied at this point, and they cannot fully exclude the possibility that it could spread through the air. 
Most of our students have been back on campus for at least seven days. In that time, we have had one person with possible symptoms, but it was determined the person did not have the illness. We are very hopeful and taking great strides to keep our campus safe.
As the Director of McKinley Health Center, I want to express my deep gratitude to our international students who have been wonderful to work with during this global situation.

I am writing to inform you of a transition in the leadership of the University of Illinois Police Department (UIPD).
Executive Director of Public Safety and Chief of Police Craig Stone announced this morning that he is leaving UIPD to become the Deputy Director of the Department of Public Safety for the City of Columbus. He will conclude his appointment here on Jan. 15.
I have asked Deputy UI Police Chief Matt Myrick to serve as interim executive director of public safety and chief of police as we conduct a national search for a candidate to fill those roles on a permanent basis. This appointment will begin on Jan. 16.
Chief Stone has made major strides in building strong processes and approaches for UIPD, and he made clear to me that he had not been actively looking at other positions. But leaders in Columbus recruited him, and the pull of family and home was great.
I am grateful for the many things Chief Stone has accomplished in his relatively short time here.
We will begin a national search for Chief Stone’s replacement as quickly as possible, and I thank Interim Chief Myrick for his dedication and his willingness to step up to ensure we have steady and dependable leadership during this time of transition.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"
2020-01-02T16:08:00Z,2020-01-02,16:8,73347,An Update on NAGPRA,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28581.html,"I write today to inform you about the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) and our plans to coordinate NAGPRA activities in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation (OVCRI).
NAGPRA is a federal law that requires institutions like ours to transfer culturally affiliated human remains and associated funerary objects, culturally unaffiliated human remains and associated funerary objects, unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony to the Native American tribes and lineal descendants.
In keeping with the requirements of NAGPRA, best practices among our peers, and the ethics of our institution, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is fully committed to the repatriation of our Native American, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian collections that fall under NAGPRA. In this process, it is our priority to engage in consultation with tribal communities and lineal descendants. This is an integral part of our ongoing commitment to creating strong and meaningful relationships with Native Nations and to ensure that Native American scholars and students feel welcome and respected at Illinois.
NAGPRA Staff and Advisory CommitteeOur NAGPRA efforts are currently led by the Chancellor’s Fellow of Indigenous Research and Ethics (Dr. Jenny Davis, Assistant Professor, Department of Anthropology), and a search for a NAGPRA Program Officer is underway. Their activities will be informed by a NAGPRA Policies & Procedures Committee. Initially, committee members will develop policies and procedures for campus-wide NAGPRA compliance. Longer term, they will serve as an advisory board to campus NAGPRA compliance efforts and the NAGPRA Program Officer.
Training and Additional InformationWe will begin hosting in-person training starting in Spring 2020. In the meantime, consider reviewing these online resources. 
National NAGPRA office training videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/NationalNAGPRA
UCLA's Carrying Our Ancestors Home project: http://www.coah-repat.com/
Coordinating efforts through one existing central campus office will facilitate fulfillment of our NAGPRA legal obligations in a timely manner and actively affirms the university’s commitment to respect the sovereignty of Native Nations in our research, teaching, and museum practices.
In addition to the OVCRI, the implementation of NAGPRA represents work by several units and departments on campus, including the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, the Office of the Chancellor, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the Department of Anthropology, the Prairie Research Institute, the Illinois State Archaeological Survey, the Spurlock Museum, American Indian Studies, and the Krannert Art Museum. I am particularly grateful to Dr. Davis, Dr. Sean C. Garrick, Dr. Gioconda Guerra Pérez, staff in the OVCRI, and the many other departments, faculty members and staff who have been leading this effort.
If you have additional questions about NAGPRA, please contact NAGPRA@Illinois.edu
Sincerely,
Susan A. MartinisVice Chancellor for Research and Innovation"
2019-12-18T16:10:00Z,2019-12-18,16:10,73477,ISG Response to Recent Events on Campus,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28730.html,"Dear Illinois Community,
As the fall semester comes to a close, I hope we all will take time to reflect on what we have learned this semester and how we can improve together.
Unfortunately, this past semester has seen hate spread on this campus unlike what has been previously seen. Racism, antisemitism, homophobia, Islamophobia, and cultural ignorance have plagued this campus and our community. Reported incidents of hate crimes have increased from the previous year and abhorrent symbols of hate have been found everywhere from University bathrooms to campus bars. The presence of these is meant to divide us and as students, we must refuse to let that happen. As a collective institution of over 51,000 students, those who seek to oppress others and divide must not bring us down.
Our values are being tested, and we will respond by reaffirming our commitment to inclusion and care for each other, regardless of background.
The epidemic of antisemitism on this campus is horrific. The idea that any individual feels threatened for their expression of personal religious or ethnic identity is unacceptable. Symbols filled with hatred and violence such as swastikas have consistently appeared on this campus and that hate will not be tolerated here. I stand in support with all students affected by these incidents and urge all to not ignore these symbols, but immediately report them so the perpetrators can be brought to justice. You can report acts of intolerance and bias here and hate crimes should be immediately reported to the police.
Due to recent events on campus, it is worth distinguishing that criticism of Israel, similar to criticism of any other country is not antisemitic and should not be labeled as such. The Illinois Student Government recently passed a resolution, ISG.03.29, Condemning Ignorance of Racism and Equating Anti-Zionism with Antisemitism. This resolution highlighted that those on this campus whose beliefs may align with Anti-Zionism at its root, are not being antisemitic in their criticism of Israel. There is however, a line that all must be aware of. There have been multiple times antisemitism and Anti-Zionism have been conflated on this campus and this resolution passed to protect our Pro-Palestinian students from being mislabeled and harassed as antisemitic due to their beliefs.
This University promises an experience that prepares students to live, work, and lead in a multicultural, diverse, and international society. The University needs to live up to their obligations and faculty, staff, administrators, and students must protect all students regardless of status, race, ethnicity, class, gender, and sexual orientation. We stand with our Jewish students, our Palestinian students, and all students, so that they do not fear for their safety and their beliefs be protected as our United States Constitution provides for.
The work of creating an inclusive environment is everyone’s responsibility. We are committed to continuing our work with faculty, students, and staff to create a positive climate on this campus that is inclusive of all students.
Have a great Winter Break,
Connor JosellisStudent Body President"

Provide Consent by January 15 for Electronic AccessIf you wish to have early access to your Form W-2, Form 1042-S, and/or Form 1095-C, then you have until 10:59 p.m. CST on Jan. 15, 2020, to complete the consent process and receive your Form W-2, Form 1042-S, and/or Form 1095-C electronically. If you are receiving a Form W-2, Form 1042-S, and/or Form 1095-C and previously consented to receive all three forms electronically, you will NOT need to consent again in order to access your Form(s) W-2, 1042-S and/or 1095-C online. However, if you are receiving Form(s) W-2, 1042-S, and/or 1095-C and did not individually consent to receive each form electronically, you will need to consent again for the individual form that does not display a consent status in order to access all of your forms online.

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes on or immediately adjacent to campus property.
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes.
The University of Illinois Police Department has received a report that a student was sexually assaulted after 2 a.m. on Sunday, Dec. 8, at a university residence hall on College Court in Urbana. There was no information available on the identity of the offender.
In instances of sexual offenses, we generally do not include specific details about exact locations or times to avoid releasing information that could lead to the identification of a survivor, unless that information is of vital importance to the safety of the campus community. We do this to reduce the possibility that a survivor becomes the target of retaliation, harassment or further psychological harm.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to assist those involved in this incident and will continue to take actions to maintain the safety and security of the campus community.
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.
If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another person, intervene if it’s safe to do so or call for assistance.
While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. The university, community organizations and local law enforcement offer a number of reporting options.
Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.
It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.

In September, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign launched our university-wide Student Success Initiative, an effort to better identify the factors that lead to positive and productive experiences for our undergraduate students. The initiative was launched at a kick-off event on September 16 that was attended by approximately 270 students, faculty, and staff. Participants provided feedback on what “student success” means to them and what we do well and where there are gaps on our campus in programs and services that factor into these definitions.
Subsequent to this event, we have held four lunch sessions this month to dig deeper into the themes that arose from the kick-off feedback. Building on those lunch sessions, we write to invite you to a dinner session specifically for students. Based on the feedback received to date, we will be looking deeper at seven categories for further exploration: teaching and learning; diversity, equity and inclusion; building community; health and wellness; affordability; academic advising and academic support.
I hope you will participate in one of these sessions:
Wednesday, December 4 at the Women’s Resource Center;
Wednesday, December 11 at the Bruce D. Nesbitt African American Cultural Center;
Thursday, December 12 at the Asian American Cultural Center.
Please RSVP here. Each session will take place from 5:30 to 7:00 p.m. and dinner will be provided.

Today, the Board of Trustees approved recommendations from a task force that spent the last year examining how we can hone our collective efforts to continue building a system-wide culture rooted in healthy relationships and free from sexual misconduct in any form.
It was a deep dive led by your peers. The 16-member task force, chaired by Executive Vice President Barb Wilson, brought together faculty, staff and students from across our universities. Their holistic review covered everything from policies and investigations to education and training, along with best practices among our peers and new approaches grounded in current research.
The result is a thorough and thoughtful roadmap with an overarching goal of establishing and reinforcing a culture that “allows all members of our university communities to learn, study, explore and work in spaces that are free from sexual misconduct.”
The recommendations approved by the board include creating new system-wide policies on faculty-student relationships, expanding education and training for faculty, staff and students, and launching new programs to gauge the impact of our efforts. They are outlined in a task force summary and in the news release below, and we will continue to consult stakeholders across the system as the task force develops the new policies and programs.
I am grateful to the task force for steering us forward, to the board for its support and to our faculty, staff and students across the system for your commitment to the vision of the future that we all share.
Sincerely,
Tim

U of I trustees approve sexual misconduct prevention measures Task force proposals promote culture of learning, safety, success
CHICAGO – The University of Illinois Board of Trustees on Thursday approved a series of recommendations by a system-wide task force that spent the last year developing a holistic approach to prevent sexual misconduct and foster a culture that ensures safety, learning and success. 
The recommendations will create new policies across the system’s three universities that further restrict faculty-student relationships, require background checks for sexual misconduct in hiring, and prohibit separation agreements with departing employees that call for withholding any sexual misconduct findings against them. 
Other recommendations will expand education and training for employees and students, with a focus on prevention, awareness and building a culture free of misconduct. New follow-up programs also will be developed to evaluate the system’s collective efforts, gauge impact and chart new approaches.
“These recommendations reflect our commitment to healthy relationships and safe campus communities where everyone can study, work, learn and explore – free from sexual misconduct or harassment in any form,” said Tim Killeen, president of the U of I System. “I am grateful to the members of the task force for sharing their time and talents to push us toward our ambitious goals.”
Recommendations approved by trustees were made by a task force that Killeen appointed last fall to take a broad-based look at current policies and practices involving sexual misconduct, a concern on college campuses nationally. The 16-member task force, comprised of faculty, staff and students from across the system, was chaired by Executive Vice President Barbara Wilson.
“Our Board of Trustees has made it a clear priority to address and prevent sexual misconduct and harassment at our universities,” said Chairman Don Edwards. “A completely safe environment for our students to learn and to prosper is essential to our academic mission, and we will work continuously toward that goal. The board is thankful to Executive Vice President Wilson and the task force for their thoughtful work, and we look forward to these new policies being implemented expeditiously.”
One policy authorized by the board will expand the prohibition of sexual or amorous relationships between faculty and students. Faculty will be prohibited from relationships with any undergraduate student, with any graduate or professional student in the same academic department or unit, or with any other student over whom they have supervisory or evaluative authority, such as teaching or research assistants. Current policy generally prohibits faculty from relationships with students in their classroom or under their supervision. Staff members also will be prohibited from having sexual or amorous relationships with students over whom they have academic, extracurricular or workplace authority.
Another policy seeks to prevent potential abusers from joining faculty and staff of the system’s universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield. The new policy would require all finalists for employment to allow their current and former employers to release any past findings of sexual misconduct.
A third policy will preserve the system’s right to share misconduct findings on a limited basis within and across the system when employees are considered for promotions or new professional opportunities. The policy will prohibit separation agreements with confidentiality or non-disclosure provisions that would limit release of misconduct findings.
Though central to the system’s efforts, the task force report says creating a culture free of misconduct “requires far more than a modification of policies and punishments. The focus must be on educating our faculty, staff and students so as to foster a sense of collective responsibility for creating, nurturing and protecting healthy work and educational environments across our units.”
The task force recommends building on mandatory annual employee training related to sexual misconduct, with an emphasis on prevention and culture as well as compliance with law. Student training also should be expanded, with a focus on real-world issues such as effectively communicating about consent in relationships, avoiding unhealthy relationships, intervening to prevent misconduct and the heightened risks posed by alcohol and drugs.
Ongoing evaluation research is recommended to assess the occurrence and nature of the misconduct, as well as the effectiveness and impact of education and training programs. Analyzing incidents and programs will help refine the system’s efforts, and should include recurring climate surveys to gauge overall progress toward its goals.
The task force worked in concert with two committees in Urbana-Champaign that looked into campus-specific issues involving misconduct. The system initiative provided recommendations that will apply to all three universities.

As chancellor, it is my responsibility to annually reaffirm our campus commitment to equal opportunity, affirmative action, and equal access. The campus is committed to creating and maintaining a community that recognizes and values the inherent worth and dignity of every person, while fostering an environment of mutual respect among its members.
Diversity within the University of Illinois advances the academic purposes of the university. An affirmative action plan is essential to achieving diversity. As a part of our affirmative action plan, consistent with state and federal laws, we undertake good faith efforts to increase the representation of women, minorities, persons with disabilities, and veterans.
University policies prohibit discrimination and harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, disability, national origin, citizenship status, ancestry, age, order of protection status, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation including gender identity, arrest record status, unfavorable discharge from the military or status as a protected veteran. These protections extend to all members of the campus community during any stage of the employment process. This includes, but is not limited to, recruitment, selection, promotion, transfer, merit increases, salary, training and development, demotion, and separation. Similarly, the university prohibits discrimination in admissions, enrollment, and provision of services, programs, and activities.
Please contact the Office for Access & Equity at accessandequity@illinois.edu if you have questions about our university policies and for assistance with discrimination, harassment, affirmative action, and disability related matters. The university’s nondiscrimination policy, procedures, and protocols are available online.
While Illinois and higher education institutions around the country continue to await further guidance on Title IX and sexual misconduct from the U.S. Department of Education, we want to assure the campus community that the State of Illinois law, Preventing Sexual Violence in Higher Education, remains in effect. In recognition of the continued importance in acting to eliminate sexual misconduct, Illinois has implemented a requirement that all new students will complete online sexual misconduct prevention training. Additionally, it is the expectation of this university that all students complete this training annually. More information about annual sexual misconduct prevention training is available on the We Care website. 
We want to emphasize our promise to continue to provide optimal services, support, resources, and guidance to address sexual misconduct in our community. Our responsibility to ensure the safety of our students, staff, and faculty will not change. We remain vigilant in responding to sexual misconduct while affirming due process, fairness, and dignity. We will be steadfast in our response and treat all matters with urgency while working to provide survivors with the many available campus resources.
Danielle Morrison, our Title IX and Disability Coordinator, provides oversight and support for the university’s comprehensive Title IX programs and initiatives. These programs and initiatives ensure compliance with university policies, state laws, and federal laws related to sexual discrimination and misconduct. Dr. Morrison can be reached at titleixcoordinator@illinois.edu or (844) 616-7978. 
Please visit the We Care website (wecare.illinois.edu), to learn more about confidential and non-confidential resources, university policies, disciplinary procedures, rights and options, and additional information related to the prevention, reporting, and response to sexual misconduct. Questions regarding Title IX may also be sent to the U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights. 
Realizing our shared vision of an inclusive campus requires that we all annually reaffirm our individual commitment. Together we will build a truly diverse, welcoming, and inclusive community of students, scholars and staff. Please join me in affirming your individual commitment to creating and maintaining an inclusive campus community. 
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

We write today to share the report we commissioned from the Consensual Relationship Policy Task Force. You can access the report here.
We want to thank the task force members for working collaboratively and deliberatively to develop their recommendations for a new, more detailed and clear policy governing faculty-student consensual relationships on our campus. The report outlines the components of the recommended new policy in detail with significant discussion of the research and reasoning that informed the task force’s work.
The task force members brought diverse backgrounds and competing perspectives to the process. And they actively and regularly sought the advice of stakeholders across the university. Groups consulted include the Provost’s Undergraduate Student Advisory Board, the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, the Committee on Faculty Sexual Misconduct and several standing committees of the Academic Senate.
We are committed to working with Senate leadership and campus stakeholders to begin the process of refining and implementing the recommendations. We will also work with the System-wide Task Force on Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Response in that process so as to ensure consistency. We are beginning to schedule conversations with key stakeholder groups across our university, and we will follow the appropriate processes and procedures to make these policy changes.
Maintaining the highest standards of academic integrity and professionalism is critical to our institutional mission. Having a clear and carefully constructed policy on consensual relationships between the university’s faculty members or other instructors and its students, will help us achieve the very high standards our state and nation expect from us.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

I am happy to share the news that we have released our second set of Guiding Principles, adding an important new layer to the foundation of core values that define us.
The new Guiding Principles join three others adopted two years ago, building on the ideals that we hold most dear and expanding the touchstone that will guide our future. The three additions reflect our bedrock commitment to a culture of excellence rooted in integrity, to financial and environmental sustainability, and to fostering the healthy relationships that allow every member of our campus communities to flourish.
Those relationships are at the center of everything we do, and the new principles ensure that we never lose sight of our responsibility to nurture a spirit of inclusion where people of all races, cultures, backgrounds and faiths are respected and embraced. Our universities share a fundamental commitment to personal dignity, tolerance and a learning environment free of bias, prejudice or discrimination.  Our campuses work hard to provide a climate of understanding and acceptance, allowing students to follow their dreams in an educational setting that is free of bullying, harassment or sexual misconduct and without fear of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia or any other expression of hatred or division.
Like the inaugural set of Guiding Principles that laid out our position on free speech, globalization and immigration, and civic engagement, our latest principles were developed through a thoughtful, inclusive process. Hundreds of you helped shape them, including our Board of Trustees and faculty, staff, students and leadership from our universities and system offices.
The full set of six Guiding Principles is posted on our website and I hope you will take time to review them and incorporate their vision into your studies, your jobs and your lives. My thanks to everyone who shared their talents to reaffirm our unwavering commitment to serve the needs of students and the public good.

I am pleased to announce that Susan A. Martinis has accepted my offer to become the vice chancellor for research and innovation at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, pending approval by the Board of Trustees.
When I first announced that Dr. Martinis would serve as interim vice chancellor for research in September 2017, I said she had earned a reputation at Illinois as a collaborative scholar and consultative leader who gets work done.
That reputation has only grown in the past two years. Since taking on the role, Dr. Martinis has provided stellar performance, collegiality, creativity and agility in leading some of the most complex and pioneering activities in the Urbana-Champaign research enterprise. Her accomplishments during this period are impressive, and the addition of “innovation” to the VCR title reflects the breadth of her portfolio and scope of her impact.
As interim vice chancellor for research, Dr. Martinis oversaw the evolution of three large-scale initiatives: the Cancer Center at Illinois and the Center for Social and Behavioral Sciences became the 8th and 9th university-wide research centers, while the Illinois Program for Research in the Humanities is on track to become an IBHE-approved institute. She led the transition of the Research Park and EnterpriseWorks back to the Urbana-Champaign campus, was named the senior leadership point-of-contact for the Discovery Partners Institute and the Illinois Innovation Network and chairs the Chancellor’s Economic Development Advisory Group. Dr. Martinis also oversaw strengthening of the business infrastructure that supports the Illinois research community, uniting pre- and post-award functions under one administrative umbrella and implementing an electronic proposal routing system.
Dr. Martinis is a dedicated educator and an experienced administrator, researcher and entrepreneur. She is an asset to Illinois and has been a strong and creative leader for our Illinois research and innovation enterprise. We are thrilled to see her accept this role. Please join me in congratulating Dr. Martinis.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes on or immediately adjacent to campus property.
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes. To protect victims’ privacy, we generally do not include specific details about exact locations or times to avoid releasing information that could lead to the identification of a survivor and cause further harm to that person.
The University of Illinois Police Department has received a report that a woman was sexually assaulted in the early morning on Friday, Oct. 25, at a university residence hall. The offender is not a person known to the victim.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to assist those involved in this incident and will continue to take actions to maintain the safety and security of the campus community.
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.
If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another person, intervene if it’s safe to do so or call for assistance.
While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. The university, community organizations and local law enforcement offer a number of reporting options.
Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.
It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.

We write today to share the report we commissioned from the Committee on Faculty Sexual Misconduct. You can access the report here.
We want to thank the committee members for working diligently and tirelessly to produce this comprehensive set of recommendations for changes to our policies, processes and practices regulating harassment and misconduct.
Our goal is to build a campus climate that is intolerant of sexual harassment and that empowers every member of our university community in their pursuit of their careers, lives and educations.
The proposals contained in the report are designed to increase the transparency of our processes and allow us to respond to sexual misconduct more expeditiously. These recommendations also suggest broader tools – including sanctions and other responsive measures – to address sexual misconduct.
Committee members had diverse backgrounds and competing perspectives. They were encouraged to represent these perspectives vigorously but to search for creative solutions that could garner unanimous consensus. The Committee reached out to other stakeholders for input when special expertise or representation was needed.
Groups they consulted include the Exploratory Group on Campus Culture, Climate, and Sexual Misconduct, the Committee on Faculty-Student Consensual Relations and the Committee on Graduate Student Mentoring. Throughout the process, the Committee stayed in close contact with the University of Illinois System Task Force on Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Response to ensure coordination of their efforts.
We are committed to working with Senate leadership and campus stakeholders to begin the process of refining and implementing the recommendations. We will work with the System-wide Task Force in that process so as to ensure consistency, where appropriate, across the three University of Illinois System universities. We are beginning to schedule conversations with key stakeholder groups across our university, and we will follow the appropriate process and procedures to make these policy changes.
We have the responsibility to be leaders in higher education and to create a framework that leads to a cultural change where policies and processes to address misconduct align with the values of respect and safety we all hold.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

2019-10-09T19:38:00Z,2019-10-09,19:38,73698,Addressing Anti-Semitism,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28689.html,"Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
I am disheartened to share news of more incidents that challenge our fundamental values of tolerance and inclusion.
On Monday, a swastika was found in the Foreign Languages Building. An investigation has been launched and is on-going.
In addition, concerns were raised about a recent presentation with anti-Semitic content at a staff development program by a Housing student-worker. Housing staff have been meeting individually with all who were present to understand fully the presentation and the nature of the conversations that followed.
I want to state publicly and unequivocally that acts and expressions of anti-Semitism are acts and expressions of hatred and discrimination that are in direct opposition to our core values. Bias and prejudice are antithetical to the educational foundations of our university and hurtful to our entire community. The idea that any individual feels threatened for expression of personal religious or ethnic identity is unacceptable. We will always recognize the rights of those on the campus to safely and freely express their perspectives and opinions. But we will also be ready to condemn statements and actions that violate our shared values and seek to demean, intimidate or devalue others in our community.
This presentation was offered in a regularly scheduled, staff development program on diversity for Housing Resident Advisors that included 11 other student-employees and one full-time staff member. This exercise was part of a university program created to help students learn to share diverse ideas and perspectives that lead to new understanding. Instead of fostering dialogue, it incited division, distrust and anger. The program allowed our students to enter an extremely challenging and potentially volatile situation without the preparation, training, education and professional oversight they needed to succeed. This is inexcusable and unacceptable. This is a failure to our students, and that is my responsibility.
I apologize to all of our students and to our community. This university promises an experience that prepares students to live, work and lead in a multicultural, diverse and international society. We did not live up to our obligations in this case. We are taking immediate action to ensure that, going forward, our programs and initiatives position our students for success.
Those actions include:
The Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs has initiated an immediate, full review of the hiring, training and professional oversight and management processes of our Resident Advisors and Multicultural Advocates.
We are instituting anti-Semitism training for all full-time Housing staff, Resident Advisors and Multicultural Advocates. This training will be in place by the end of this semester.
We will commission an external review of our University Housing multicultural educational programs to help us identify and to implement best practices based on leading national peers.
I want to assure all of our students, staff, faculty and community that we are fully conscious of the seriousness of incidents of anti-Semitism, racism, bias and prejudice on this university. We will continue to track, investigate and address incidents swiftly.
The work of creating an inclusive environment is everyone’s responsibility. I am committed to continuing to work with faculty, students and staff to create a positive climate.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

In order to maintain an effective emergency response and evacuation plan, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign recently completed a test including two components: a drill and an exercise. The test was designed to challenge our emergency response procedures and how we notify you of a threat to our campus community.
On Sept. 3, we initiated a test of our Illini-Alert emergency notification system. The drill was announced ahead of time by a mass email to campus and an Eweek notice to faculty and staff. The Illini-Alert system sent an email to the campus email addresses of all active students, faculty and staff. Those who have registered alternate email addresses also received a notification. Those who have registered a cellphone number were sent a text message during this drill.
Illini-Alert messages are also posted to Facebook, Twitter, digital signage and on campus websites through our Emergency Web Alert System. This approach increases the speed and breadth of our distribution of emergency notifications, and it provides a robust communication engine that will continue to function successfully even if one system fails to work properly.
For the second component, university personnel and emergency responders from a number of local agencies gathered for a functional exercise on Sept. 27 from 8 a.m. to noon at the Illinois Fire Service Institute. Those involved were presented with a scenario involving a natural disaster that directly affected campus. The exercise tested various components of the Campus Emergency Operations Plan, including evacuation procedures.
This test was conducted to ensure we have a robust response plan in the event of a campus emergency, and that our emergency notifications will reach you in a timely and effective manner. If you have not signed up to receive emergency messages through Illini-Alert, please visit emergency.illinois.edu to register.
To view the University’s emergency response and evacuation procedures, please visit go.illinois.edu/EmergencyResponse.
The University of Illinois Police Department is committed to maintaining a safe and secure campus environment where education, research and public service can flourish. We can only do so with the assistance of our community, and we hope this information is useful to all of our campus partners.

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. For the University to be in compliance with Federal Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Regulations we are required to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:
http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/
The program webpage was prepared in accordance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989. It describes the University’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse, makes clear the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard, and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and provides university and community resources to help with drug or alcohol related problems.
As a reminder, under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that Act and the federal Drug Free Schools and Communities Act and the Drug Free Workplace Act, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on University property or as part of any University activity. The passage of the Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act in 2019, which legalizes certain activities related to marijuana under Illinois state law effective January 1, 2020, does not affect federal law or the university’s marijuana prohibition. 
In addition, the university’s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on University property (this includes but is not limited to outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any University activity.
The university’s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and all new employees in accordance with federal guidelines, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources included on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.
Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. University employees should contact Illinois Human Resources at (217) 333-2137.

2019-09-27T18:50:00Z,2019-09-27,18:50,72619,Community Safety Notice,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28681.html,"Dear campus community member:
We are writing to make you aware of number of concerning incidents involving inappropriate touching which have occurred during the first several weeks of this fall semester. None of these incidents have resulted in physical injuries, and the majority have occurred in off-campus areas. We nevertheless wanted to provide you with the following information so you can take the appropriate steps to protect yourself and others.
Between Aug. 24 and Sept. 18, a total of eight incidents of inappropriate touching or public indecency have been reported to three separate police agencies in our area, including the Champaign Police Department, Urbana Police Department and the University of Illinois Police Department. One person was arrested on Sept. 22 and charged with public indecency in connection with one of those incidents. Preliminary investigation suggests that other individuals are responsible for the remaining incidents, and that not all of the incidents are related to each other.
Between the dates these crimes were reported and today, we have been unable to release information as they are the focus of an active investigation. However, there has been an enhanced police presence to keep our community members safe in areas where the incidents occurred.
The locations, dates and additional information regarding each of these incidents are detailed in a map on the University of Illinois Police Department website: https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/7513/803088
These incidents remain under investigation by all three departments, and we intend to provide you with updates when appropriate. Police officers from area departments are patrolling the campus area and are on the lookout for suspicious behavior.
Although no one has been physically injured, these incidents reinforce the importance of observing some important safety tips for keeping ourselves and others safe:
Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks escort if you need one.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it does not feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we are happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.
Watch out for each other. Call 9-1-1 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.
Do not allow strangers to follow you into your building. It may seem polite to hold the door for someone, but that often allows unauthorized people to enter. It is OK to ask someone to swipe their card to enter a residence hall.
Anyone with information about these incidents is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android.

A possible, though low probability, case of mumps has been reported on campus.
McKinley Health Center has notified students and instructors in the Chemistry Department regarding possible exposure.
An information link is included below for your information. 
If you believe you may have mumps: we encourage you to seek medical care at McKinley Health Center.
http://mckinley.illinois.edu/sites/default/files/docs/mumps.pdf
As you know, the single best way to prevent spread of infectious illness is to wash your hands.
Since mumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person, persons may prevent contracting mumps with a few simple actions:
Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, and throw the tissue away after use.
Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. If water is not near, use an alcohol-based hand cleaner.
Do not share eating and/or drinking utensils.
Refrain from close contact with individuals who are sick/experiencing symptoms.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. (Germs are often spread when a person touches something that is contaminated with germs and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.)
In situations such as this, the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District, area hospitals, and McKinley Health Center work closely together to ensure the safety of the campus and the community.
Additional information will be shared with the campus as it becomes available.

Today is National Voter Registration Day. Democracy relies on each of you to participate in helping to shape our campus community and your communities at home. Voting is one way that each of you can participate in civic engagement and it is part of our collective responsibility as citizens of the United States of America.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has partnered with TurboVote to make it easy for you to register to vote, update your voter information (i.e. change of address), and get reminders and information about voting/poll locations specific to where you register.
TurboVote has options to register, including online (if your State has this option), or an option to receive a completed registration form with a pre-addressed stamped envelope. Registering to vote is as simple as signing a form, sealing an envelope, and mailing it in. If you choose to register anywhere in Illinois, there is an online option.
If you are already registered to vote, you can also sign up with TurboVote to receive text and/or email reminders to stay up to date with early-voting/election day reminders and polling place notifications.
Again, participation in voting is one way to engage in our democracy. We hope that you take the time to make your voices heard. Learn more about voter registration.

As you may know, this past Sunday morning, a noose was found in a residence hall elevator. The University of Illinois Police Department made an arrest Monday.
Regardless of the intent behind this incident, the fact that we are confronted by a symbol with such intense racist and violent connections is a difficult reminder of the damage that hatred and intolerance inflict on our entire community. To those like myself, who grew up in the South when Jim Crow laws were still in full force, this incident recalls memories of senseless violence and horrific acts carried out in the name of racist hatred. It is extremely upsetting that, more than a half century later, we are still facing symbols of hate that force another generation to ask why the color of your skin, the religion you practice or where your parents came from should make you a target of anyone’s anger or distrust.
We will not tolerate racism here at Illinois. We will not tolerate bigotry here at Illinois. We will not tolerate discrimination here at Illinois. We are committed to creating a university free of acts of intolerance, bias or prejudice. Incidents like this one remind us how much work remains for all of us to see that these words are always and truly practiced here at this university.
Housing staff and the University of Illinois Police Department (UIPD) responded quickly to this incident. UIPD immediately began an investigation that led to Monday’s arrest of a student. In addition to being subject to potential criminal prosecution, possible violations of the student code by individuals are also reviewed by our own Office for Student Conflict Resolution to determine any appropriate disciplinary action. The student is currently not allowed on campus property. 
We did communicate the incident to all students in our residence halls along with information about how they could access support resources. Additionally, the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion have begun a series of meeting opportunities to allow students safe places to discuss the incident and any concerns they have.
We aspire to be a beacon of inclusion and excellence. I want to assure all of our students, staff and faculty that we are fully conscious of the seriousness of incidents like this and the chilling effect they have on every single thing we do here. We will continue to use all of our resources to investigate and address incidents as quickly as possible.
The work of creating an inclusive environment is everyone’s responsibility. Whether faculty, students or staff, we each have a role to play in creating a positive climate. And we will endeavor to more broadly share news of incidents of intolerance and racism that occur on the campus in order to ensure that our entire community can come together to make everyone who comes here feel welcomed and respected.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

In an effort to further enhance our cyber defenses, we want to remind you of a common cyber-attack that everyone should be aware of – phishing.
""Phishing"" is the most common type of cyber-attack that affects individuals and organizations. Phishing attacks can take many forms, but they all have a common goal – getting you to mistakenly disclose sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card information, or bank account details.
Although we maintain security controls, provide awareness training, and conduct phishing simulations and tests to help protect our campus community from cyber threats, we need your help as the first line of defense.
What You Can Do
To avoid these phishing schemes, please observe the following best practices:
Avoid clicking links or attachments from senders that you do not recognize. Be especially wary of .zip or other compressed or executable file types.
Never provide sensitive personal information (like usernames and passwords, Social Security Numbers, financial information) over email.
Watch for email senders that use suspicious or misleading domain names.  Look closely at the email address of the sender.
Beware of any shared document that you’re not expecting to receive.
Be especially cautious if you receive an email containing a warning banner indicating that it originated from an external source.
If you are unsure if an email is legitimate or not, please contact your local IT support or the Technology Services Help Desk, 217-244-7000 or consult@illinois.edu.
Thanks again for helping to keep our network, and our people, safe from these cyber threats.

Joe BarnesChief Privacy & Security OfficerUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"

As we start the semester, we would like to take a moment to remind you of some tips and resources for keeping yourself and your property safe. We have a very safe campus. However, no community is entirely free of crime.
In the past several weeks, a higher than usual number of burglaries to residences and vehicles have been reported to the Champaign Police Department in areas close to campus. In the majority of these cases, the offender accessed the vehicle or residence through an unlocked door.
We need your assistance to prevent these crimes. Thieves seek opportunities to access your personal property by looking for unlocked doors. The best way to prevent property crime is to lock doors at all times. Always lock up your apartment, residence hall rooms, vehicles and bicycles. Valuables like wallets, cellphones and backpacks should always be kept out of sight and never left unattended in public places like libraries or gyms.
In addition to locking your doors and securing your valuables, it is important to remember some general tips for keeping yourself safe:
Always walk in groups, and use well-lit, high traffic routes. Call SafeWalks at 217-333-1216 if you need a Student Patrol escort when traveling at night.
Do not allow people to follow you into secure locations. If someone tries to follow you into your residence hall or apartment building, request that they use their own key or swipe card to gain entry.
Trust your instincts, and report any unusual or suspicious activity. Even small pieces of information can prevent a crime and help protect yourself and others.
State law and university procedures provide amnesty for 9-1-1 callers. If you or someone else is in need of emergency assistance, neither the caller nor the person in need will be cited for underage liquor violations.
The University of Illinois Police Department and surrounding law enforcement agencies work hard to keep campus safe. However, we cannot do it alone. We need your help to look out for yourselves and each other. Thank you for being an active participant in the safety of our community, and we wish you a safe and wonderful fall semester.

Craig A. StoneExecutive Director of Public Safety and Chief of Police"

2019-08-20T11:32:00Z,2019-08-20,11:32,82149,Smoke and Tobacco Free Campus,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28658.html,"Dear Campus Community,
Last fall, I announced that the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign would become 100 percent smoke and tobacco-free in August 2019. I am writing to remind you that this new policy is now currently in place. The new effort builds upon the smoke-free policy that was successfully implemented in 2014, banning the use of all smoke-producing tobacco products on campus. The new smoke-and-tobacco free policy applies to everyone – students, faculty, staff, students and visitors.
It includes all forms of tobacco, including but not limited to chewing tobacco, snuff, snus and dissolvable forms such as orbs and strips. Vaping devices such as e-cigarettes and juuls are still prohibited. The banned locations include all campus-owned property (PDF) – indoors and outdoors – as well as private vehicles parked on campus-owned property. 
Since Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the law legalizing recreational marijuana beginning Jan. 1, we have received many questions about the use of marijuana at our university. The use or possession of marijuana will still be prohibited on campus when the law goes into effect. These university marijuana policies comply with federal law, including the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989.
For more information about the smoke-and-tobacco free policy, please see the Campus Administrative Manual and visit the Smoke and Tobacco Free website. To help faculty, staff and students adapt to the new policy, the campus will continue offering a variety of tobacco-cessation programs through McKinley Health Center and Campus Wellbeing Services.
I ask everyone to respect our new policy to create a healthy environment for our entire university community.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor"

Please be advised that MCORE Project 4 road construction on the west side of Wright Street from Chalmers Street to Green Street will continue through December. Alternate access routes will be maintained for buildings along the corridor at all times, but rerouting around the area is strongly encouraged.

We are delighted to announce a unique new educational program that is being launched this fall for our nearly 20,000 academic professional and civil service employees. For employees in positions represented by a union, this program will be adopted through the collective bargaining process.
Our faculty and staff are the foundation of the University of Illinois System’s standing as a global leader in education and discovery. Their daily hard work and dedication are the building blocks of our efforts to serve communities, the state of Illinois and the nation. Yet it is challenging for many staff to fully appreciate just what their talents have helped build – three universities whose academic excellence has attracted a record 86,000 students; a collective research powerhouse that ranks among the world’s most innovative university systems; a system that pumps $17.5 billion into the state’s economy every year, supporting one in every 46 jobs.
So we have developed a unique new program to give staff an opportunity for a first-hand look at the big picture. Know Your U is perhaps the first program of its kind in the country, offering eligible university employees time away during their normal workday to experience the remarkable programs and facilities that their hard work supports. It is a chance to learn more about academic units that have helped set enrollment records for six straight years; about research that promises to build on the system’s long, rich legacy of groundbreaking innovation; and about the iconic facilities that define our three, best-in-class universities.
More information is available on the Know Your U website and also will be emailed to employees by university and system human resource offices. Our human resource staff was instrumental in developing the program, and we are grateful for their commitment, creativity and good work.
Know Your U is an investment in our most valuable resource, giving staff employees a broader perspective into the scope and impact of our universities, and how their roles contribute to the greater good. We also hope they have some fun along the way, and walk away with an even greater sense of pride in a university system that is truly altogether extraordinary.

As we have done in the past, we are once again asking you to help us distribute important safety information to our students. Emergencies can happen anywhere and at any time, so it is important that we take a minute to prepare ourselves for a situation in which our safety could depend on our ability to react quickly.
Before the first day of class this semester, we ask that you visit http://police.illinois.edu/instructor-resources. There, you will find two items: A brief script we hope you will read on the first day of class and a one-page handout that we would like to have distributed to all students either by hand or as part of your syllabus.
These two items contain valuable information that can keep us all safer in the event that a fire, weather emergency or active threat should emerge. By distributing this information, we are ensuring that everyone in our campus community is empowered with tools they can use to protect themselves and others.
We also encourage you to empower yourself by visiting http://police.illinois.edu/safe. There are steps you can take right now to prepare should you find yourself in an emergency situation.
Thank you for taking a few minutes to enhance the safety of our campus community.

When I began as chancellor at Illinois, I said that I believed hiring a vice chancellor for diversity, equity and inclusion was critical to our success. Dr. Garrick has the passion, experience and leadership necessary to integrate our robust and numerous diversity and inclusion efforts into innovative strategies and practices that enhance these efforts and embed them into every aspect of our missions.
I want to express my deep appreciation to Dr. Nancy “Rusty” Barcelo for her service and leadership as special assistant to the chancellor for diversity and for establishing a strong foundation that allowed us to attract a leader of Dr. Garrick’s caliber.
I hope you will join me in congratulating Dr. Garrick once he arrives on campus in his new role at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The report is posted at http://go.illinois.edu/2019CommissionReport. I invite you to take a few minutes to read their suggestions and observations.
The Commission was comprised of two co-chairs and 12 members representing the broad experiences of students, faculty members, staff, alumni and athletics, including Indigenous university stakeholders and former portrayers of Chief Illiniwek.
I want to thank the members of the Commission for their thoughtful work this year. They have fulfilled the charge I gave them in a balanced and consultative manner.

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is committed to creating a safe environment for everyone who participates in programs on our campus, including those who are under the age of 18. As summer activities begin, we would like to remind faculty and staff about the university policy on protection of minors and our procedures for implementing that policy. You can find more information on those items by following the below links.
Protection of minors policy: http://go.illinois.edu/POMpolicy
Procedures for implementing the policy: https://cam.illinois.edu/policies/hr-64/
These procedures outline requirements that apply to all members of our university community, including university personnel, volunteers and contractors associated with events and activities where minors will be involved. Units with programs or activities designed to include minors who are not enrolled at the university are required report those activities to the University of Illinois Police Department at http://go.illinois.edu/POMform. External entities or Registered Student Organizations may report activities using a shortened version of this form which can be found at http://go.illinois.edu/POM-short-form.

We are pleased by the strong support for the University of Illinois System and public higher education across the state in the fiscal year 2020 budget approved by the Illinois legislature and sent to the governor, who is expected to sign it into law.
The budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 would provide the U of I System’s largest appropriation increase since fiscal 2001, almost two decades ago. Funding would grow by nearly 5 percent, or $27.4 million, in line with the increase that Gov. J.B. Pritzker recommended for day-to-day operations at our three universities in his budget proposal earlier this year.
In addition, the budget re-appropriates capital funding to support key construction projects at our universities. It also re-appropriates $500 million for development of our Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) and Illinois Innovation Network (IIN), pioneering education and research initiatives that will accelerate the breakthroughs that drive progress and economic growth.
Highlights of the budget include:
An appropriation of $622 million for operations, up 4.6 percent from the current fiscal year. It would be our largest year-to-year increase since fiscal 2001.
Re-appropriation for bricks-and-mortar projects across the system, including the Advanced Chemical Technology Building at UIC and Public Safety Building at UIS.
Re-appropriation of $500 million in capital funding for planning and construction of DPI, a new research center in downtown Chicago, and 15 IIN research hubs across the state, including one at each of our universities and satellite campuses.
Statewide, $451 million for the Monetary Award Program (MAP), up $50 million or 12.5 percent from the current fiscal year. MAP provides financial aid to support Illinois students, including thousands across the U of I System.
An additional $10 million for the second year of a state scholarship program created to encourage in-state students to attend college in Illinois and stem an outmigration of talent to other states. The U of I System and other universities provide matching funds to double the impact of the state’s contribution.
If the House concurs with a $45 billion public works construction program approved by the Senate, the U of I System would also be in line for $686 million to fund capital improvements at all three universities. Major projects include renovation of Altgeld Hall for a math, statistics and data science collaboration center in Urbana-Champaign; an initiative involving quantum information sciences and technology that Urbana is developing in partnership with the University of Chicago, Argonne and FermiLab; a computer design research and learning center for UIC’s College of Engineering; and a new facility at UIS that will replace the existing library, including new spaces for teaching and academic support. The House is scheduled to consider the Senate-approved program this weekend.
The state’s investment will help continue the rise of a premier university system that has seen enrollment grow to record highs for six straight years, transforming the lives of more students and building on the pipeline of talent that is critical to Illinois’ future. It will support access and affordability initiatives that include a five-year, in-state tuition freeze, as well as ongoing efforts to recruit and retain world-class faculty, and expand programs and facilities that are cornerstones of our standing as a global leader in education and research discovery.
Our success in this spring’s legislative session is the byproduct of a true team effort and we are grateful to everyone across the system who stepped up to advocate on our behalf. That included more than 3,000 emails during the spring session that shared stories about the impact the U of I System has had in their lives and how it drives the fortunes of our state.
We also are grateful to Gov. Pritzker and the legislature, including our U of I Caucus, for the bipartisan cooperation that fostered this renewed investment in our state’s flagship university system. We are determined to reward their confidence, and help steer Illinois to a new generation of progress and prosperity.

This week, the year’s marquee celebrations kick off across the University of Illinois System.
Commencements symbolize the crucial mission we have been entrusted with for more than 150 years – to transform students’ lives and send off new waves of world-class talent year after year to lift the fortunes of our state, our nation and our world.
Our graduates represent the very core of what we do. And as we celebrate them, I hope all of you will also join me in taking a moment to reflect and to reaffirm how we do it.
The U of I System has earned its high global standing through values foreshadowed more than a century ago by our fourth president, Edmund James, who guided a then-fledgling university through an era of growth that helped make us the powerhouse we are today.
“Great things are waiting,” James said of the university in 1904 as his presidency began, “if it only measures up to its opportunities; if it only performs faithfully and simply the duties which the state thrusts upon it.”
His time-proven formula can lift us even higher – to a place as the standard for higher education in this century – if we continue stretching toward our ambitious goals faithfully, simply and with excellence and integrity painted through everything we do.
Integrity defines us. It is our touchstone in classrooms and laboratories, on football or soccer fields, and in our important role as advocates for both higher education and the needs of our state. And our ideals far outstrip the broad dictionary definition of honesty and strong moral character.
We are also forthright, hard-working and transparent. We are grounded, never cut corners and always share credit. We are dedicated, loyal and focused squarely on the public good. We are thoughtful, respectful and determined to make people proud, even when no one is watching. We take the high road. Always the high road.
Those bedrock Midwestern values don’t go unnoticed. Coupled with our rich legacy of excellence, they have added to our worldwide respect and our allure as a go-to destination, helping us set system-wide enrollment records, build on our ranks of world-class faculty and forge new research paradigms to tackle society’s most pressing challenges.
Better yet, the values we model also radiate for decades to come through the lessons that each and every graduate carries with them into the world. We send off over 22,000 every year, adding fresh winds of reason to the air of divisiveness and negativity that often pervades our nation in these turbulent times.
As the Class of 2019 takes the next step in its journey this week, be proud of what they have accomplished and of the solid foundation we have collectively instilled to help them succeed, both in the workplace and in their lives.
My deepest thanks for everything you do – for sharing the talents, the passion and the values that make the University of Illinois System altogether extraordinary.
Sincerely,
Tim"

Thank you to everyone who joined us for the annual Conversation with Senior Leadership at the Illini Union last week. I extend a special thanks to Dean Jeff Brown for moderating a thoughtful and candid discussion about some of the most pressing issues that affect our future.
We filled nearly every seat in Illini Union rooms A, B & C for this event, and we received many questions from the audience. We made an effort to answer as many as we could during our Q&A session, but there were still a few topics that were not covered in the questions we answered. I wanted to share those topics and responses with the campus community in this note. You will find them below. 
If you were not able to attend this event, I hope you will watch this archived, captioned version of the livestream video.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor
University contracts with minority-owned businessesIncreasing contracts with local and minority-owned businesses is a priority. Because we are a public university, our contracts are bound by state laws and protocols. We have worked hard to expand opportunities for minority-owned businesses within these guidelines.Last year, we hired LaTonya Webb, Director of Business Community and Economic Development. This individual works on outreach, provides assistance for vendors and works with the Purchasing Office to set supplier diversity goals. She also works with existing diverse suppliers to ensure they are certified through the statewide system, so they are eligible to be selected for projects. We are also part of a Joint Taskforce on Higher Education Supplier Diversity, a statewide effort led by public university presidents. Its goal is to share best practices and identify opportunities for collaboration, in addition to suggesting legislation that would maximize our ability to expand opportunities to minority-owned businesses.
Future plans for expanding digital accessibilityAccessibility is a critically important part of our educational mission and history of innovation. We are continuously looking for opportunities to ensure that structures and delivery formats do not impeded our ability to provide education broadly. One ever-evolving area of accessibility consideration is the digital space.During my first year as chancellor, I charged a committee to develop an Electronic IT Accessibility policy that would make sure that digital resources and digital information are accessible to all students, faculty and staff.Finalized in October 2018 and available in the Campus Administrative Manual, the Electronic IT Accessibility policy promotes high-level coordination of accessibility efforts at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It defines a standard of accessibility compliance and, through a flexible implementation plan, establishes procedures to help ensure that information technology used for the mission of the university is accessible to all persons, regardless of ability or delivery format. View the full policy here.
Plans to expand educational opportunities and access to members of Tribal NationsOver the past few years we have been taking systematic steps to both increase the representation of students, faculty and staff members from Tribal Nations at this university and to ensure that our campus offers welcoming and supportive experiences to these members of our community.Last year’s Critical Conversation on Native Imagery led to the formation of this year’s Commission on Native Imagery: Healing and Reconciliation that is working to bring recommendations to our leadership team for new traditions and new ways to honor and partner with Native Nations. We expect the recommendations of the Commission to be delivered in May.We are continuing to expand our partnership and strengthen our relationship with the Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma. In fact, Chief Craig Harper will be visiting the campus this week to discuss our progress together and our plans for the future. We are working on establishing new relationships with other nations and plans for visits are being scheduled for the summer.We also continue to establish new traditions and activities such as the Land Acknowledgement Statement and the university-wide celebration of Indigenous Peoples Day to honor the cultures of our Native Peoples while opening new educational opportunities to every member of our community."

We would like to provide you with an update regarding the Campus Safety Notice we issued last week, when it was reported that an individual had entered a student’s room at Daniels Hall without permission. The offender in that case has been identified as a 13-year-old individual who does not live in Champaign County. We interviewed him last week in the presence of a parent, and we will be working with the appropriate agencies to address the situation.
Residence hall security is important to us, so please take the time to review the below precautions to keep yourself and others safe.
Do not allow strangers to follow you into your building. It may seem polite to hold the door for someone, but that often allows unauthorized people to enter. It is OK to ask someone to swipe their card to enter a residence hall.
Watch your belongings. Theft is the most common crime on college campuses everywhere, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is no exception. Lock up or secure your personal belongings whenever possible, even if they are sitting right next to you.
Lock your doors. The easiest way to prevent theft and burglary is by locking the door to your vehicle or residence. Criminals often will look for an open door or window to steal your items.
Bring it with you. If you’re leaving campus for an extended period of time, bring your valuables with you. During school breaks, criminals will take advantage of an empty campus.
Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This Campus Safety Notice is issued in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about crime on or immediately adjacent to their campuses to aid in the prevention of similar crimes and to assist in the identification of offenders.
This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, please visit CrimeReports.com or visit the University of Illinois Police Department to view the daily crime log.
The following attempted burglary occurred around 6 p.m. Saturday at Daniels Hall, 1010 W. Green St. (map), Urbana: 
It was reported that a U. of I. student was asleep in a residence hall room when awakened by an individual searching through the student’s dresser drawers. The offender abruptly left the room. It did not appear that anything was stolen.
Security cameras captured an image of the suspected offender entering the building by following another person who swiped in. That image can be viewed here: https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/7513/777581.
The University of Illinois Police Department has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area, and we are fortunate to have our force supplemented by the Urbana and Champaign police departments. Between these agencies, the Urbana campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 1,800 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting www.373tips.com or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on iOS and Android. All messages to Crime Stoppers are electronically stripped of identifying information and forwarded to police by an independent third party.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
Do not allow strangers to follow you into your building. It may seem polite to hold the door for someone, but that often allows unauthorized people to enter a building they should not be in. It is OK to ask someone to swipe their card to enter a residence hall.
Watch your belongings.Theft is the most common crime on college campuses everywhere, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is no exception. Lock up or secure your personal belongings whenever possible, even if they are sitting right next to you.

Dear colleagues:
We are pleased to announce that a program providing additional paid days off during our December/January holidays has been extended to a fourth straight year.
Employees who are eligible for leave benefits will receive three paid gift days for this year’s Reduced Service Days – on December 27, 30 and 31. Before the program began in 2016, employees had been required to draw from their annual pool of paid time off to be paid for the reduced service days.
New this year, employees of the UI Hospital and Clinics will receive the gift days as three additional floating holidays that may be used any time between December 27, 2019, and June 30, 2020, with supervisor approval. This approach will ensure that these units can maintain excellent patient care services during the holiday break and as always, seven days a week.
The program is reflected in the FY 2020 Holiday Schedule that will be distributed to employees. Our universities, hospital and clinics, and system offices will follow up with more details, including how to report the gift days and how they can be used on different days by essential employees who must work on December 27, 30 or 31. As in years past, the gift day program will be evaluated after the holidays to determine whether it will be extended.
For employees in union-represented bargaining units, paid time off for the holidays is addressed through the required collective bargaining process.
Our employees are the foundation of our excellence and our global standing. We hope by continuing this program it demonstrates in concrete terms just how much we appreciate everything you do!

We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes on or immediately adjacent to campus property.
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes. We are not including certain details in this alert so as to avoid releasing identifying information about the victim.
The University of Illinois Police Department has received a report that a student was sexually assaulted around 10:20 p.m. Monday, April 8, at Sherman Hall, 909 S. Fifth St., Champaign (map). The offender is a person whom the victim met through a dating app. Images of the suspect were captured on security cameras and can be viewed here: https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/7513/772502.
While we do not typically provide specific information about times and locations of sexual assault incidents to protect the victim’s privacy, we are including that information in this notice because police have not yet made contact with the offender, and it is possible that he is still in the area. At this time, residents in the area of Sherman Hall do not need to take any action but are asked to call 9-1-1 if they see someone matching the description of the offender.
If you have non-emergency information about this incident, you are encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. 
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.
If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another person, intervene if it’s safe to do so or call for assistance.
While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. The university, community organizations and local law enforcement offer a number of reporting options.
Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants.
Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason.
Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity.
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.
It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.

As many of you know, accreditation is the primary way higher education institutions in the United States are assessed to assure and improve their quality. On March 30-31, 2020, nearly one year from now, we will have our reaccreditation on-site peer review visit. During this time, several evaluators will visit our campus. 
Currently, much work is being done in anticipation of this on-site visit. Over the last year, six groups of faculty and staff have begun to write drafts of our assurance argument responding to the criteria for accreditation. We invited Academic Senate representatives to provide feedback on these early drafts, and we will invite everyone to see a penultimate draft of the report in the fall when we will welcome additional feedback from you. For more information on our process so far, please visit our reaccreditation website.
In the meantime, here are a few things you should know about accreditation:
We are a member of and accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC).
There are five accreditation criteria: Mission; Integrity: Ethical and Responsible Conduct; Teaching and Learning: Quality, Resources, and Support; Teaching and Learning: Evaluation and Improvement; and Resources, Planning, and Institutional Effectiveness.
Title IV federal financial aid funds are limited to students enrolled in an accredited institution. In 2017-2018, this amounted to more than $250 million at Illinois.
An institution’s accreditation status can impact credit transfer from one school to another.
Many graduate and professional schools restrict admission to students who graduated from an accredited institution.
Through accreditation’s processes of self-assessment and external peer review, an institution can ensure that it attains a level of quality and progresses toward meaningful and lasting improvement.
We have a strong history of accreditation and are confident we will be reaccredited, as we have been every year since 1913. But we also want to be sure you are aware of this event and its importance to our university. We hope you will learn about this process and be prepared for our 2020 visit.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor

Dear students, faculty, staff and friends:
Today, President Trump signed an executive order regarding freedom of speech on our nation’s college campuses.
The University of Illinois System clearly staked its position in December 2017 when it issued a set of guiding principles on three pressing issues facing campuses across the country, including the ongoing debate over First Amendment rights.
The guiding principles reaffirm the U of I System’s bedrock commitment to free speech in a concise, forthright statement developed through a five-month process that included collaboration among more than 200 key stakeholders across our three universities.
“An unyielding allegiance to freedom of speech – even controversial, contentious, and unpopular speech – is indispensable to developing the analytical and communication skills of our students and empowering all members of our campus communities to be active and informed citizens,” the guiding principles document declares. “We are committed to the open exchange of competing ideas, perspectives, and values – a founding principle that built our nation – and to making the U of I System’s own distinctive institutional voice part of these productive dialogues.”
But academic excellence also requires an environment of mutual respect, and the system will “vigorously and even-handedly protect … against conduct that falls outside the First Amendment” to ensure a safe and robust exchange of viewpoints, the statement says.
We will review the executive order to ensure it is in keeping with our guiding principles, which were created through a thoughtful and inclusive process rooted in the core values that have carried the system to its place as a global leader in education and discovery.
The principles we adopted then and continue to follow now help ensure that each of our universities fosters an inclusive, welcoming campus climate that promotes an open exchange of divergent ideas and develops new generations of leaders.
In addition to free speech on campus, the guiding principles document also addresses the topics of civic engagement, and globalization and immigration. The document and a news release sent when it was announced may be found here.
Thank you for your dedication and loyalty to our three great universities.
Sincerely,
Tim KilleenPresident, University of Illinois System

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. For the University to be in compliance with Federal Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Regulations we are required to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Information about this program can be found here:
http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/
The webpage was prepared in accordance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989. It describes the University’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse, makes clear the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard, and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and provides university and community resources to help with drug or alcohol related problems.
This program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and all new employees in accordance with federal guidelines, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources included within the report.
Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. Civil service employees should contact Staff Human Resources at (217) 333-3101 and academic staff can contact Academic Human Resources at (217) 333-6747.

2019-02-28T17:38:00Z,2019-02-28,17:38,52219,A Message from ISG Regarding Unofficial,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28587.html,"Fellow students, This Unofficial St. Patrick's Day, we want to encourage you to be proactive in looking out for one another.
As Student Body President, I hope you will ensure the safety of yourselves and your peers. In years past, there have been fatal incidents related to activities surrounding this event. These occurrences have led to a larger police presence on campus to safeguard student safety. While this is the case, there are things you can do to help protect yourself and others.
Please follow these preventative steps to avoid fatal incidents this year: 
 Remember to stay hydrated and nourished. Consuming large amounts of alcohol can lead to dehydration, which can be detrimental to your health. Remember to drink plenty of water and eat food regularly to avoid unforeseen risks.
 Know the signs of alcohol poisoning. Alcohol poisoning signs and symptoms include:
Confusion
Vomiting
Seizures
Slow breathing (less than eight breaths a minute)
Irregular breathing (a gap of more than 10 seconds between breaths)
Blue-tinged skin or pale skin
Low body temperature (hypothermia)
Passing out (unconsciousness) and can't be awakened
If you notice someone with these symptoms call 911 immediately as their life may be in danger.
The university maintains Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan policies regarding underage drinking. This means that when a student requires emergency treatment, the university will not pursue disciplinary action against that student for their personal substance use. So, please remember to take care of your fellow students and do not be afraid to seek out medical help if necessary.
 Understand the Social Host Law in Illinois. Party hosts who provide alcohol to underage individuals can potentially be charged up to a Class 4 Felony (which carries penalties of 1 to 3 years in jail and up to a $25,000 fine).
Always remember these simple tips:
If hosting a party do not let strangers in, you may be held liable for them.
Never get into a car with someone who is impaired.
If you have a bad feeling about the situation, your gut feeling is your best bet. Stay alert, be cautious, and do not be afraid to leave.
Finally, please keep these important contacts on hand for this weekend:
Safe Walks: (217) 333-1216 (You can also use an emergency phone to contact a dispatcher. Please give at least 15 minutes notice.)
MTD SafeRides: (217) 265-RIDE (7433)
Rape Crisis Hotline: (217) 384-4444 (Available 24 hours a day)
Domestic Violence Hotline: (217) 384-4390 (Available 24 hours a day)

Remember, whatever you decide to do this Friday, be responsible, be alert, and be respectful of our university community.

On Friday, March 1, 2019, many students and visitors will participate in an event known as Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. The university does not support or condone this event.
The Champaign, Urbana, and University of Illinois police departments, assisted by other local and state agencies, will patrol the campus district on March 1. They will enforce all applicable ordinances in commercial and residential areas and have authority to intervene if private parties threaten to disturb the peace. In addition, Champaign and Urbana officials will enact retrictions on liquor sales intended to curb overconsumption. Emergency medical personnel will be available to provide care.
University police will continue to focus on protecting students, staff, faculty, and university property. If asking a disruptive student to leave class could escalate into a confrontation, you may seek assistance from these officers. Should you need to report an incident, call METCAD at 911 for emergencies, 333-8911 for non-emergencies.
As in years past, we have made clear to students that academic business will continue as usual on Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. Instructors are encouraged not to cancel classes.
The Student Code http://studentcode.illinois.edu/ addresses student responsibilities on campus. Sections 1-102(d) concerns classroom conduct expectations, section 1-305 is the policy on drugs, and section 1-307 focuses on alcohol consumption. The Code empowers instructors to ask disruptive students to leave class; after class, names of disruptive students should be reported to the Office of Student Conflict Resolution at 217-333-3680.
Students will be asked not to bring any liquids into Foellinger Auditorium and Lincoln Hall Theatre. Longstanding policy prohibits liquids and food in these spaces.
Students who interfere with the academic mission of the university will face serious consequences. Thank you for reinforcing this message before and on March 1.

2019-02-20T16:26:00Z,2019-02-20,16:26,18007,Awareness of Foreign Influence on Illinois Research and...,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28584.html,"You may have heard recent news reports about research integrity and inappropriate foreign influence on university research. We are writing to you to make sure you know that these concerns are legitimate, non-partisan, and growing, and we want to remind you of your responsibilities to
safeguard university resources and intellectual property;
fully disclose external financial interests, affiliations, and activities; and
follow export regulations.
The topic of foreign influence on federally sponsored research, including confidential peer review, has recently garnered significant attention across multiple government agencies—especially at the Department of Defense (see National Defense Authorization Act), but also at other agencies like the National Institutes of Health (see Letter from NIH Director Francis Collins)
The phrase “foreign influence” in this context is a technical term relating to economic and political espionage and the protection of the intellectual property and scholarship of U.S. researchers from exploitation by “foreign governments and external entities.”  The designation of “foreign influence” is neither a catchall phrase to describe U.S. researchers who are not native to this country nor an attempt to circumscribe international scholarship or limit collegial relationships with international colleagues.  
While the University of Illinois remains dedicated to cultivating research collaborations with foreign sponsors, we as a research community must be transparent about our external relationships, maintain the integrity of our research enterprise, and protect our intellectual property and university resources. The regulations in place and the guidance provided do not impinge on our land-grant educational mission. There is no conflict between monitoring external affiliations and access to university resources and intellectual property and our commitment to the principles of freedom of inquiry and scholarly collaboration. We are mindful of our responsibilities as a public research university—security is critical to our preservation and academic freedom is the currency of our success. Please consider the following questions to ensure that your international relationships and interests are managed with these goals in mind.  Are you aware of the university’s export control policies?When traveling on university business, remain cognizant of whether or not your travel, research, or foreign engagement may be subject to U.S. export regulations. If so, be sure to review institutional resources on managing export compliance here, or contact the Export Compliance Officer at exportcontrols@illinois.edu. On a related note, be aware that using some social media applications in certain countries may be monitored by law enforcement officials.
Have you promptly disclosed inventions to the Office of Technology Management (OTM)?Ensure that any transfer of intellectual property, proprietary data, materials, or technical information to foreign entities is covered by an appropriate agreement negotiated by the Office of Technology Management.Have you fully disclosed your non-university activities?Always obtain pre-approval from your department head, chair, or dean for all non-university income-producing activities. This includes outside professional activities as well as relationships and foreign talent recruitment programs. To report these activities and affiliations, update your Report of Non-University Activities in START myDisclosures.Have you completed or updated any required sponsor-specific disclosure form?Some sponsors like the Public Health Service (PHS) require investigators to disclose significant financial interests and non-Illinois sponsored travel that could reasonably be related to your institutional responsibilities. This includes financial interests with foreign entities, including foreign institutions of higher education or the government of another country.Have you met all agency disclosure requirements, including current and pending research support, in all applications for sponsored funding?This includes all foreign or domestic grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and institutional awards. You should also note any planned collaborations, (foreign or domestic), and the scope of the collaboration, including the exchange of information, materials, or data.
Have you shared your affiliations with outside organizations?If you are required, be sure to disclose your activities, affiliations, and relationships when speaking, teaching, or publishing with outside organizations like scientific journals and professional societies.

2019-02-06T09:50:00Z,2019-02-06,9:50,70997,Campus Parking Rate Changes,https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28565.html,"Dear members of the campus community,
We want to inform you of an increase to University of Illinois parking rates for Fiscal Year 2020 (FY20), which begins July 1, 2019. This will be the first annual permit rate increase since 2012. This increase is necessary to keep pace with maintenance and construction costs associated with upkeep and improvement to parking infrastructure. Unfortunately, these expenses cannot be deferred by external funding. The Parking Department is exclusively self-funded, managing five parking structures and over 150 parking lots on campus. These necessary rate increases have been endorsed by the Parking Advisory Committee and approved by the chancellor.
We are sending you this message in advance of rate changes so you can make an informed decision on your parking needs, as well as provide departments the opportunity for budget planning.
Following are the changes you will see beginning FY20:
Faculty and Staff Virtual Parking Permits will increase from 0.8% to 0.9% of an individual’s annual base salary. Here are specific examples of how salary levels will be effected by the new rate structure:
SALARY                0.8%/year           0.9%/year           0.8%/month          0.9%/month
$30,000/year        $240                    $270                      $20.00                     $22.50
$50,000/year         $400                    $450                      $33.33                     $37.50
$70,000/year        $560                    $630                      $46.67                     $52.50
The salary-based permit rate will be capped at $745 annually. Individuals earning $82,777.77 a year and above will pay this capped rate, which represents a monthly increase of $9.58.
For employees in union-represented bargaining units, the rate changes will be implemented through the required collective bargaining process.
There will be increases in other permit types as well:
Faculty and Staff (E14, B22) and Student Shuttle (E14) Permits will increase from $127 per year to $143 in July 2019 and to $161 in July 2021.
University department rental spaces will increase in July 2019 from $1,980 to $2,228 and then to $2,475 in July 2021.
Event parking will increase from $300 to $350 in July 2019. Event Parking allows for unlimited parking for visitors (lots B04, B22, E14, F23, pending availability).
The parking meter rates will increase by $.25 per hour; from $1/hour to $1.25/hour in July 2023.
Parking staff members have been conducting presentations over the previous month to a variety of university councils and committees to further explain these rate changes and answer questions.
Sincerely,
University of Illinois Parking Department"
