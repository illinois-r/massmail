                        <p id="isPasted">Good morning to the faculty, staff and students at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign!</p><p>It is my pleasure to inform you that your new chancellor will join the campus community in a few short weeks. Charles Lee Isbell Jr. — a leading computer scientist, academic innovator and currently the provost at the University of Wisconsin-Madison — will become the 11th chancellor at Urbana in a designate capacity on July 16, pending final approval by the Board of Trustees.</p><p>I hope to see all of you at our welcome reception for the new chancellor at 3 p.m. on Monday, June 9, in the Colonnades Club on the third level of Memorial Stadium, 1402 S. First St., in Champaign (please enter on the stadium’s west side).</p><p>I am certain that you will be as inspired by Dr. Isbell as I am. We are well-positioned and destined to excel and thrive in these challenging-yet-hopeful times, and he is the right leader to build upon Chancellor Robert Jones’ many distinguished accomplishments.</p><p>Our good news will soon be known far and wide, as the news release below will be publicly distributed shortly.</p><p>Please join me in welcoming Charles to our campus,</p><p>Tim</p><p><em>Please note: This is an approved event for overtime-eligible employees, operations permitting and with prior supervisory approval.</em></p><p><em>If you need disability-related accommodations to participate, please contact System Human Resource Services at <a data-fr-linked="true" href="mailto:jrgomez@uillinois.edu">jrgomez@uillinois.edu</a>.</em></p><p id="isPasted">URBANA, Ill. — Charles Lee Isbell Jr., a leading computer scientist, academic innovator and provost at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, will become the 11th chancellor of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and vice president of the University of Illinois System, U of I System President Tim Killeen announced today.</p><p>Isbell will formally assume the role Aug. 1, pending approval by the University of Illinois Board of Trustees. He will serve in a designate capacity beginning July 16 as current Chancellor Robert Jones completes his term.</p><p>Killeen said Isbell’s appointment follows an extensive national search that attracted a diverse and highly qualified pool of candidates from across the country. Throughout the process, Isbell emerged as a standout — for his academic prowess, leadership experience, collaborative spirit, vision and passion for the transformative role of public higher education.</p><p>“As I grew to know Dr. Isbell, I soon realized that he should be the next chancellor of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. He has a clear, creative and inspiring vision for what public higher education can and should be and for how this great university will continue to work for the people of our state in the years ahead,” Killeen said. “He brings a deep understanding of not only technology and its fast-evolving, far-reaching impacts, but also the vast range of disciplines that are integral to any great university and our society — the arts and humanities, the social sciences, STEM and so many more.</p><p>“Ultimately, I am thrilled to welcome Charles to Illinois and eager to work together to ensure that Urbana-Champaign continues to be a thriving hub of educational excellence and groundbreaking research across its incredible range of disciplines, a place where the future we need comes to life,” Killeen added.</p><p>Isbell, 56, brings more than two decades of experience in higher education leadership, research and innovation. As provost at Wisconsin, he has guided the university’s academic mission across all schools and colleges, launched innovative academic initiatives and worked to strengthen graduate education and research excellence.</p><p>At the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he spent 20 years, he served as executive associate dean and later dean of the College of Computing. There, he helped grow the college into one of the largest and most diverse computing programs in the nation and played a key role in launching the university’s groundbreaking Online Master of Science in Computer Science program — the first of its kind offered at scale by a leading research university.</p><p>As chancellor of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Isbell will lead a top-ranked public research university with more than 56,000 students and nearly 13,000 faculty members and staff.</p><p>He brings a collaborative spirit to the leadership of the university’s next era of innovation, excellence and impact.</p><p>“It’s the honor of a lifetime to be appointed to the role of chancellor and I’m deeply grateful to President Killeen and the Board of Trustees,” Isbell said. “I’m energized by this chance to serve the citizens of Illinois and advance the mission of learning, discovery, engagement and economic development.”</p><p>Hailing from Atlanta, Isbell earned a bachelor’s degree in information and computer science from Georgia Tech and completed his master’s and Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His research in artificial intelligence and machine learning has focused on interactive and human-centered systems, with applications in education, ethics and social impact. He is a Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence and the Association for Computing Machinery, an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and has written more than 100 academic papers.</p><p>Isbell is also a nationally recognized advocate for broadening participation in STEM fields, particularly in computing. His efforts to create more inclusive academic pathways have influenced national conversations on the importance of making a way for all to access, contribute to and benefit from technology education. His work has been featured in The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Chronicle of Higher Education, among others.</p><p>Isbell and his wife, Sheila, have two children, Cody and Joni.</p><p>###</p><p>The University of Illinois System is a world leader in research and discovery, and the largest educational institution in the state with more than 97,700 students, about 28,000 full-time equivalent faculty and staff, and universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield. The U of I System awards more than 27,000 undergraduate, graduate and professional degrees annually.</p>
