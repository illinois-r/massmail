We are Gabi DalSanto and Anjali Kumar, your Student Body President and Vice President. We are so excited to get to know as many of you as possible, and to work with you to create a better Illinois for each and every student.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">To start the year, we wanted to offer some opportunities to get involved and further information about our goals for this year!&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>First Year Students, Apply to ILIAD!</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">The Initiative for Leadership, Involvement, Advocacy, and Development (ILIAD) Program is a great opportunity for first-year students to grow their personal leadership skills, all while gaining an insider perspective into the University’s student government and other University entities. This program is perfect for any first-year student looking to start their leadership journey here on campus. ILIAD boasts a high success rate in placing students in leadership positions across campus and in student government!</p><p dir="ltr">If you are interested, you can find more information about the program and the application here: <a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://isc.illinois.edu/get-involved">https://isc.illinois.edu/get-involved</a>. &nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Applications are due September 14th!</strong></p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Questions, Ideas, Suggestions?</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">We want to connect with you! In addition to tabling throughout campus and meeting you in person, this year the Illinois Student Council is launching a campus experience form to hear your thoughts. Students can use this form to easily reach the student government directly. We can then take your ideas and figure out how to best advocate for you! You can <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=b35GRCxGok6CP3gA3lQ04yvCcCHR_PlLjChiLWC7z_BUMjJCTUEzRU9XR00xS05TWDQ0NDVJMkw5Qi4u&origin=Invitation&channel=0">find the campus experience form here</a>, and you will also be able to access it soon through the <a href="https://isc.illinois.edu">Illinois Student Council website</a>. Also through the website, you can find information on any vacancies in ISC, in-depth explanations of the structure and responsibilities of ISC, and information on the initiatives we’re working towards. The Illinois Student Council is made up of over 70 students who are consistently working to make this school better, through the Executive Branch, which includes Anjali and me, along with our amazing team, as well as the Legislative Branch, which is primarily composed of elected representatives, who represent and advocate for the students and their respective colleges!&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>About Us!</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Anjali and I ran on a progressive and innovative platform that includes advocating for divestment, implementing harm reduction, increasing access to reproductive healthcare on campus, accessibility, and better policies surrounding the right to protest. We liked to say that a vote for us was a vote for progress, and we are working tirelessly to make that progress happen. Since getting elected, we have talked to many campus services to figure out a way to make those goals come true, but for important updates and regular progress checks, please <a href="https://www.instagram.com/illinoisstudentcouncil/?hl=en">follow the Illinois Student Council Instagram</a>!&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Have an amazing semester, Illini, and we can’t wait to see you around!</p><p dir="ltr">I-L-L,</p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: inherit;">Gabi DalSanto, President, and the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: inherit;">Illinois Student Council</span></p>
