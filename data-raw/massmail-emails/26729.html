Green Street, Urbana.<br/><br/>OFFENDER DESCRIPTIONS:<br/><br/>The offender is described as a clean shaven black male in his 20&#39;s, with a medium build and short hair in a crew cut style.&nbsp;&nbsp;The offender was last seen wearing a brown baggy waist length coat. <br/><br/>Information about the race or ethnicity of alleged offenders is provided only to aid detailed descriptions that include physical stature, clothing or unusual characteristics.&nbsp;&nbsp;Racial descriptions do not, by themselves, offer a meaningful picture of an individual&#39;s appearance.<br/><br/>POLICE RESPONSE:<br/><br/>The University of Illinois Police Department is working to identify and apprehend the offender.&nbsp;&nbsp;Witnesses to this event or those with information are encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216 or Crime Stoppers at 217-373-TIPS (8477<br/><br/>SAFETY INFORMATION:<br/><br/>Members of the campus community are strongly encouraged to follow these safety tips to decrease their potential for becoming a victim:<br/><br/>-Stay alert - call the police immediately to report suspicious activity and/or if this subject is observed.<br/><br/>-Trust your instincts - if it does not feel right, call for help.<br/><br/>-Avoid walking alone at night.
