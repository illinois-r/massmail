                        </p>
                        <p id="isPasted">Dear students, faculty and staff,</p><p>Last fall, we outlined our mutual understandings on how to continue promoting an inclusive campus, particularly as it relates to antisemitism. As part of that effort, we committed to sharing this reminder of our values and actions we have taken to foster a welcoming, supportive environment for all.</p><p><span style="font-size: inherit; background-color: transparent;">As a global university that reflects a full range of cultures, beliefs, faiths and perspectives, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign does not condone expressions of antisemitism, Islamophobia or hatred and harm against any individual or groups. We remain fully committed to fostering inclusion and respect and will never tolerate discrimination or violence.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: inherit; background-color: transparent;">Several measures have been implemented in the time since that agreement was finalized:</span></p><ul><li>We&nbsp;<a href="https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/521499682.html">established a Title VI Office</a> to serve as a central place for reporting and responding to concerns about discrimination, harassment and related retaliation on the basis of race, color and national origin, including shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics. The Title VI office also monitors outcomes, identifies patterns, and assesses their effects on the campus climate. This broader perspective allows us to recognize and address emerging concerns across our campus in a thoughtful, constructive and legally compliant manner.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>The Title VI Office also developed&nbsp;<a href="https://diversity.illinois.edu/institutional-equity/title-vi-coordinator/training/">training</a> available to all students, faculty and staff to expand their understanding of Title VI Misconduct, and how it is addressed by university policies and procedures. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://diversity.illinois.edu/diversity-campus-culture/belonging-resources/">Campus Belonging</a> has begun publishing a periodic&nbsp;<a href="https://diversity.illinois.edu/diversity-campus-culture/belonging-resources/annual-reports/">summary of reported incidents</a> of bias to promote further transparency and accountability.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>The university developed a&nbsp;<a href="https://stratcom.illinois.edu/free-speech/">Free Speech and Expression page</a> to help faculty, staff, students and visitors quickly find the university&rsquo;s relevant policies, support resources and answers to frequently asked questions. Information from this page was shared with all first-year students through the Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion @ Illinois module in their University 100 courses.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>The university completed an&nbsp;<a href="https://publish.illinois.edu/campus-climate-assessment">All Campus Climate Survey</a> in Fall 2023 to examine how our university&rsquo;s values of diversity, equity, and inclusion are reflected in the daily experiences of students, faculty, and staff. The results of this survey were shared in Fall 2024 through a high-level findings report on the website and four campus sessions during the Spring 2025, culminating in a Campus Climate Survey Summit in May 2025.<br><br></li><li>The university&rsquo;s <a href="https://cam.illinois.edu/policies/hr-48/">Nondiscrimination Policy</a> has been updated, and information has been added to university websites to provide additional guidance to students and others to provide important context to the policy. This added information includes <a href="https://oae.illinois.edu/wp-content/uploads/Discrimination-Examples.pdf">examples</a> of conduct that may constitute prohibited discrimination and a <a href="https://studentengagement.illinois.edu/getinvolved/joinastudentorg">statement</a> reaffirming our commitment to promote welcoming and inclusive student organizations. Registered Student Organizations continue to be required to sign the nondiscrimination statement and include the nondiscrimination statement in their governance documents, and are subject to the disciplinary procedures in the Student Code if they fail to do so or otherwise violate the nondiscrimination statement.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Students, faculty, staff and visitors are encouraged to report incidents of discrimination and harassment so that we can take the appropriate steps to address those. Each of these offices provides resources to do so:</p><ul><li><a href="https://diversity.illinois.edu/about/title-vi-office/">Title VI Office</a></li><li><a href="https://diversity.illinois.edu/about/title-ix-office/">Title IX Office</a></li><li><a href="https://diversity.illinois.edu/about/office-for-access-equity/">Office for Access &amp; Equity</a></li></ul><p>Last fall&rsquo;s agreement reaffirmed our commitment to our <a href="https://diversity.illinois.edu/antiracism-initiatives/joint-statement-on-anti-semitism/">Joint Statement on Antisemitism</a> and, more broadly, our rejection of discrimination and hate in all its forms. We are proud to implement measures that build on our ongoing work and take new steps to bring consistency and transparency in addressing discrimination and harassment based on national origin and shared ancestry.</p><p>Perhaps now more than ever is a time to celebrate our shared values and mission to enhance lives through the pursuit of knowledge, understanding, compassion and empathy. Thank you all for continuing to make Illinois a welcoming, impactful and transformative community.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Robert J. Jones<br><span style="font-size: inherit; background-color: transparent;">Chancellor</span></p>
